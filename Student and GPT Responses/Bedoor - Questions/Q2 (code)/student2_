def starwars(n, character):
 if character == "obi":
   return ("May the force be with you." + " ") * (n-1) + "May the force be with you."
 elif character == "vader":
   return ("I find your lack of faith disturbing." + " ") * (n-1) + "I find your lack of faith disturbing."

starwars(3,"obi") # May the force be with you. May the force be with you. May the force be with you.
starwars(2, "vader") # I find your lack of faith disturbing. I find your lack of faith disturbing.
