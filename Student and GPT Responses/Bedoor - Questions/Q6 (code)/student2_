fruit_lst = ["Apple", "Banana", "Pear", "Apricot", "Orange"] # this can be arbitrary
filtered_lst = []

# Write your code below this line

###### SOLUTION ######
#for i in fruit_lst:
filt_objct = filter(lambda i: i[0] == "A", fruit_lst) # filter() doesn't need to loop through the list (i.e., go through element) -> no need for
print(list(filt_objct)) # problem rn: print 5 times

###### SOLUTION END ######
