Amazon.ae and Noon.com do not allow scraping, while Instock.ae does allow scraping.
I have come to this conclusion by researching the terms of service and website policies of each of these websites. Amazon.ae and Noon.com both have explicit statements that prohibit scraping or the use of automated tools to collect data from their websites. On the other hand, Instock.ae does not have any such restrictions mentioned in their terms of service or website policies.
