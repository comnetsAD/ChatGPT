The 2 websites that allow us to scrape are amazon.ae and noon.com. instock.ae does not allow scraping. I know this by putting robots.txt at the end of the URL of each website. For amazon.ae, it has the format of:
```
User-agent: *
Disallow: /folder/
```
which means partial access or that the website allows scraping in general but disallows crawling particular sections or files. For noon.com, it has the format of:
```
User-agent: *
Allow: /
```
which means full access allowed in scraping. Meanwhile, instock.ae has Disallow for everything, suggesting that scraping is not allowed.
