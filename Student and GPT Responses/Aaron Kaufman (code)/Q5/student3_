The intercept estimate represents where ses is 0, showing the point where socio-economic status is average.
Thus the value -0.03262 shows that when the socio-economic status of the student is average (0) their scores
are -0.03262, which means they are scores below average. On the other hand, when the math grade of 8th
grade is average (=0), the socio-economic status of the student is above average with an estimate of 0.51792.
Following the form y= b+mx, the regression line is zmath8= -0.03262 + 0.51792(ses). Therefore, the slope
m is 0.51792 indicating that for every increasing unit in socio economic status, the 8th grade math score
increases by 0.51792.
#when ses = -2
-0.03262 + 0.51792*(-2)
## [1] -1.06846
#when ses = 2
-0.03262 + 0.51792*(2)
## [1] 1.00322

Predictions (-2 & 2): For -2, when socio-economic status is below average by two points, the math score
is also below average, by 1 point, and when socio-economic status is above average by 2 units, the math
score is too, above average by 1 unit. This resonates with the slope of the regression (~0.518 3dp ) since for
every unit change (increase or decrease) in socio economic status, there is a change (increase or decrease)
respectively by around half in the change of math score.
