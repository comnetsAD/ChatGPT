There is a positive correlation between the math score and socio-economic status.
math score = −0.03262 + 0.51792 ∗ ses + ε If one’s ses increases by 1, his/her math score
will increase by 0.518 standard deviation. 16.8% of the data is explained by this regression.
The P values of coefficient and intercepts are less than 0.01. Thus, the regression is
significant in 1% significance level.
Predictions:
predict(lm(zmath8 ~ ses, scores), data.frame(ses = -2))
## 1
## -1.068451
predict(lm(zmath8 ~ ses, scores), data.frame(ses = 2))
## 1
## 1.003214
