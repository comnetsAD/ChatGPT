3) interpret the result of regression (discuss slope & intercept) Intercept = -0.03262
Slope = 0.51792
The intercept represents a predicted value of math score when the socio economic status
is 0 (which is equivalent to having an average SES). The slope shows how much change
the math score among 8th grade students undergoes with one unit change of SES. According
to the summary of the regression, the socio-economic status is statistically significant.
4) compare the prediction of the math score at SES equal to -2 and 2 Equation: y = a
+ b*x, where a is intercept and b is slope; y is math score and x is socio economic
status.

y = -0.03262 + 0.51792*(-2) = -1.06846
y = -0.03262 + 0.51792*(2) = 1.00322
According to these results, one can conclude that when the socio economic status of a
