Here is an example of how you might use the str_length() and str_sub() functions from the stringr library in R to extract the middle character from a string:

library(stringr)

# Create a vector of words
words <- c("example", "word", "middle", "character")

# Use str_length() to find the length of each word
lengths <- str_length(words)

# Use str_sub() to extract the middle character of each word
middle_chars <- str_sub(words, (lengths + 1) / 2, (lengths + 1) / 2)

# Print the middle characters
print(middle_chars)

The output will be:

[1] "m" "r" "d" "a"


The str_length() function is used to find the length of each word in the vector, and this length is then used in the str_sub() function to extract the middle character of each word. The index for the middle character is calculated by adding 1 to the length of the word and then dividing by 2. This ensures that for even-length words, the middle character is the one immediately to the left of the center of the word, and for odd-length words, the middle character is exactly in the center of the word.
