The researcher may be making an incorrect assumption in assuming that the relationship between education and income is causal, based on the correlation observed in the survey data alone. The correlation between education and income may be due to other factors that are not being controlled for, such as inherent abilities, family background, or job opportunities.

To make a causal claim, the researcher would need to use a research design that can account for these confounding variables, such as a randomized controlled trial or a natural experiment. Additionally, it is important to consider the direction of causality, whether it is education causing income or income causing education.

To support their conclusions, the researcher could use a causal graph in R, using the ggdag package for example. For example, to show that education causes income, the graph would include edges from education to income, with arrows pointing in that direction, and also include any other variables that might affect the relationship, such as abilities, family background, and job opportunities.

library(ggdag)

# Create a causal graph
g <- dagify(
  alist(
    Education ~ 1,
    Income ~ Education + Abilities + FamilyBackground + JobOpportunities
  )
)

# Plot the graph
ggdag(g)


In this causal graph, Education causes Income, but also other variables such as Abilities, FamilyBackground, and JobOpportunities might affect the relationship between Education and Income.

In conclusion, the researcher should be cautious in making causal claims based on correlation alone and should use a research design that can account for confounding variables and consider the direction of causality. A causal graph could support the researcher's conclusions by showing the relationships between different variables.
