library(charlatan)

# Create fake data
set.seed(123)
df <- data.frame(
  id = row.names(df) <- 1:10,
  customer_name = charlatan::name(),
  is_active = sample(c(TRUE, FALSE), 10, replace = TRUE),
  order_total = round(rnorm(10, mean = 50, sd = 10), 2),
  order_date = as.Date(sample(seq(as.Date("2020-01-01"), as.Date("2022-12-31"), by = "day"), 10), origin = "1970-01-01"),
  phone_number = charlatan::phone_number(),
  address = charlatan::address()
)

In this example, the id variable serves as the unique row name, customer_name is a character variable, is_active is a logical variable, order_total is a numeric variable, order_date is a date variable and phone_number is a phone number variable and address is a character variable. The set.seed() function is used to ensure that the same random values are generated every time the code is run.

You can verify the dataframe by using head(df) or str(df)
