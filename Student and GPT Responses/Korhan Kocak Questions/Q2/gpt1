This game can be formulated as a normal form game with ùëõ players, where each player has two possible strategies: "Contribute" or "Not Contribute". The payoff for each player depends on the number of players who choose to contribute and whether the public good is provided or not.
The payoff matrix for each player can be represented as follows:
    			Contribute  		Not Contribute
Good Provided   		1   			2
Good Not Provided   		-1  			0

It's clear that the game has multiple Nash equilibria, one of them is where k or more players contribute and the public good is provided. The other Nash equilibrium is where less than k players contribute and the public good is not provided.
In this game, each player has a dominant strategy which is to not contribute. This is because no matter what other players do, it's always better for each player to not contribute, as they will get a payoff of 0 rather than -1.
As a result, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium of this game is the one where no player contributes and the public good is not provided.
It's also possible for the game to have multiple Nash equilibria, if there are different ways for k or more players to contribute and the public good is provided.
It's worth noting that this game can also have mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium, where each player randomly chooses between contributing and not contributing with a certain probability.
