This can be formulated as a normal form game with 2^n possible pure strategy profiles, where each player 𝑖 has two pure strategies: to contribute (C) or not to contribute (NC).
The payoff matrix for the game can be represented as follows:
    C   NC
C   1   2
NC  2   0
The pure strategy Nash equilibria for this game can be found by analyzing the best response of each player, given the strategies of the other players. A pure strategy Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies where no player has an incentive to deviate from their chosen strategy, given the strategies of the other players.
There are two cases to consider:
If 𝑛 < 𝑘, then there are no pure strategy Nash equilibria. This is because no matter what strategies the players choose, the public good will not be provided.
If 𝑛 ≥ 𝑘, then there are multiple pure strategy Nash equilibria. These are the strategy profiles where exactly 𝑘 players choose to contribute, and the rest do not. For example, if 𝑛 = 3 and 𝑘 = 2, then the following strategy profiles are Nash equilibria: (C, C, NC), (C, NC, C), and (NC, C, C).
It is worth noting that in this game, there is no unique equilibrium, as there are multiple equilibria which are all Pareto efficient.
In summary, the normal form game is defined by:
A set of players {1,2,3...n}
Each player has two pure strategies C and NC
The payoff matrix is defined by: if the public good is provided, each player gets a payoff of 2 if they did not contribute and 1 if they contributed. If the public good is not provided, each player gets a payoff of 0.
The pure strategy Nash equilibria are all the strategy profiles where exactly 𝑘 players choose to contribute and the rest do not.
