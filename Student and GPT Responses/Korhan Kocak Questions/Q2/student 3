The pure strategy Nash equilibria are presented as follows:
Case 1: no one participates. If player 2 does not contribute, no good will be offered. Even if player 2 does not participate, the good will not be supplied, therefore preferable for them not to contribute.
Case 2: two people have participated. A good will be delivered if player 2 contributes. If a player does not participate, a good will be offered. Therefore, it is preferable for player 2 to refrain from contributing.

When no one contributes, the situation is a Nash equilibrium. Each participant thus has incentive not to contribute in the expectation the other will.
