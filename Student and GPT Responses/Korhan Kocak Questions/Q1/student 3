Nash equilibrium is a concept within game theory where the optimal outcome of a game is where there is no incentive to deviate from the initial strategy. The prisoners' dilemma is a common example that shows the effect of the Nash equilibrium. It states that nothing is gained if any of the players change their strategy if all others maintain their strategy. It is important to note that dominant strategy can be included in Nash equilibrium whereas a Nash equilibrium may not be the best strategy in a game.
