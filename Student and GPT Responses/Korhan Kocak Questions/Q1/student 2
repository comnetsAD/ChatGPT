A Nash equilibrium (NEq) is a strategy profile s* = (s1*, s2*, ...) such that no player i can make herself better off choosing an action different from si* , given that every other player j adheres to sj*. (In other words, a Nash equilibrium is designed to model a steady state of social interaction that emerges out the players gaining experience by playing repeatedly).
