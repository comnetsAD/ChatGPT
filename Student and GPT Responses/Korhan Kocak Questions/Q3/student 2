3 players pick an integer between 1 and 100, the person closest to ⅔ of the average of the total of their numbers. 

Finding the Nash equilibrium pushes us to anticipate and assume what others will do and act according to our best interests.

If, let’s say, we logically want to be our outcome to be as high as possible, we want the number we pick to be very high so that when it’s divided to ⅔ of the average, it’s still high. At this point the best choice is to pick 100, so (100; 100; 100).

⅔ (300/3) = 67, therefore we can understand why, after calculating ⅔ of the average of a hundred why best answer is preferably any number smaller than 67. No number is bigger than (100), so ⅔ (x+y+z)/3 will never equal to something bigger than 67.

We keep going:
⅔ (65) = 45. Knowing that it’s in everyone’s rational best interest to make a guess above 67, then my best response is always less than ⅔ of 67.

⅔ (45) = 30. The same logic can be indefinitely applied in order to find the best strategy.

⅔ (30) = 20…

The Nash equilibrium for this game is when players choose 1, (1, 1, 1). Whatever others play, it’s best to always go with the lowest answer possible.
