The maximum number a player can choose is 100. The second 99 and third 98. The average is 99, 2/3 of average is 66. 66 is closest to 97, player who chooses the lowest number wins and the others get nothing.

Question says each player wants to maximize the amount she receives and chooses the least # possible. If all choose the same #, the dh is divided between all players. If all choose 1:
⅔ of 1 = ⅔, nearest is 1.

If 2 players select 1 and one player chooses 2.
Average = 4/3
⅔ = 8/9
Players who choose 1 get payoff and other doesn't.

Each should choose minimum number and maximize payoffs. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium is (1, 1, 1).
