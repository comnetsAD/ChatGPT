We can solve this problem by iterated elimination of weakly dominated strategies.

We know that ⅔ of the obtained average is at most 67 (⅔(100) rounded to the nearest integer).

So any choice in the interval {68, …, 100} is weakly dominated.

Thus, after one step of elimination, we assume all players will pick integers between 1 and 67. 

By the same logic, we assume players pick integers in the interval {1, …, 45} and so on. 

At each step the set of remaining strategies is {1, …, K} where K ≥ 2.

The procedure terminates when all players choose 1. 

Thus (1, 1, 1) is a NE.
