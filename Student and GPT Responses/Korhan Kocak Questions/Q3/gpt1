This can be formulated as a normal form game with 100^3 possible pure strategy profiles, where each player ùëñ has 100 pure strategies: to announce any integer from 1 to 100.
The pure strategy Nash equilibria for this game can be found by analyzing the best response of each player, given the strategies of the other players. A pure strategy Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies where no player has an incentive to deviate from their chosen strategy, given the strategies of the other players.
To simplify the game, we can assume that the players are rational and understand that the average is between the lowest and the highest number announced. Thus, if a player announces a number x, the only way to win the dirham is if x is closest to 2/3 of the average of the three numbers. Since the average is between the lowest and the highest number announced, the only way to win the dirham is to announce a number between (2/3) * Lowest number and (2/3) * Highest number.
Given this, we can see that there are multiple pure strategy Nash equilibria in this game:
If the three players announce different numbers, the player who announces the number closest to (2/3) * Average of the three numbers wins the dirham.
If two players announce the same number, the player who announces the number closest to (2/3) * Average of the three numbers wins the dirham.
If all three players announce the same number, the dirham is split equally between the three players.
In summary, the normal form game is defined by:
A set of players {1,2,3}
Each player has 100 pure strategies, to announce any integer from 1 to 100
The payoff matrix is defined by: the player whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average of the three numbers wins 1 dirham. If two or more integers are the same, the dirham is split equally between the people whose integer is closest to 2/3 of the average.
The pure strategy Nash equilibria are all the strategy profiles where each player announces a number between (2/3) * Lowest number and (2/3) * Highest number.
It's important to note that this game has multiple equilibria as there are many different strategy profiles that could be chosen, and all of them are Pareto efficient.
