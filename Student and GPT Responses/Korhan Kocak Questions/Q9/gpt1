To find the pure and mixed strategy Nash equilibria for the given games, we first need to find the best response for each player for each strategy of the other player.
For player 1 (top row):
If player 2 plays strategy L (left column), player 1's best response is to play strategy U (1,1) as it gives them a higher payoff than playing strategy M (-2,-2) or D (-2,-2)
If player 2 plays strategy C (center column), player 1's best response is to play strategy U (-2,-2) as it gives them a higher payoff than playing strategy M (1,-1) or D (-1,1)
If player 2 plays strategy R (right column), player 1's best response is to play strategy U (-2,-2) as it gives them a higher payoff than playing strategy M (-1,1) or D (1,-1)
For player 2 (bottom row):
If player 1 plays strategy U (top row), player 2's best response is to play strategy L (1,1) as it gives them a higher payoff than playing strategy C (-2,-2) or R (-2,-2)
If player 1 plays strategy M (middle row), player 2's best response is to play strategy R (-1,1) as it gives them a higher payoff than playing strategy L (-2,-2) or C (1,-1)
If player 1 plays strategy D (bottom row), player 2's best response is to play strategy R (1,-1) as it gives them a higher payoff than playing strategy L (-2,-2) or C (-1,1)
From this, we can see that there is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium in this game because if player 1 plays strategy U, player 2 will play strategy L, but if player 1 plays strategy M, player 2 will play strategy R, and if player 1 plays strategy D, player 2 will play strategy R.
To find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we need to check for any probability distributions over the strategies that result in no player being able to improve their payoff by choosing a different strategy. We can see that if both players randomize their strategy with probability 1/3 for each strategy, neither player has an incentive to deviate from their mixed strategy as they are already receiving the highest expected payoff possible given the other player's mixed strategy.
In summary, there is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium in this game, but there is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium where both players randomize their strategy with probability 1/3 for each strategy.
