A pure strategy Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy while the other players keep theirs fixed. A mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a probability distribution over pure strategies for each player, such that no player can improve their expected outcome by changing their probability distribution while the other players keep theirs fixed.
In this game, player 1 has three pure strategies U, M, and D, and player 2 has three pure strategies L, C, and R.
First, we will consider the pure strategy Nash equilibria.
If player 1 chooses U, player 2 has no strategy that guarantees a higher payoff than L, so (U, L) is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.
If player 1 chooses M, player 2 has no strategy that guarantees a higher payoff than C, so (M, C) is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.
If player 1 chooses D, player 2 has no strategy that guarantees a higher payoff than R, so (D, R) is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.
Now, we will consider the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.
Player 1 can assign probabilities p, q, and r to strategy U, M, and D respectively, and player 2 can assign probabilities x, y, and z to strategy L, C, and R respectively.
Player 1's expected payoff from strategy U is p + (1-p-q-r), from strategy M is -2q -2(1-p-q-r) and from strategy D is -2r -2(1-p-q-r)
Player 2's expected payoff from strategy L is p + x(-2) + y(-2) + z(-2), from strategy C is -2p + x + y(-1) + z(-1) and from strategy R is -2p -2q + x(-2) + y + z(-1)
For player 1 to have a best response, we need to have:
p + (1-p-q-r) >= -2q -2(1-p-q-r) >= -2r -2(1-p-q-r)
For player 2 to have a best response, we need to have:
p + x(-2) + y(-2) + z(-2) >= -2p + x + y(-1) + z(-1) >= -2p -2q + x(-2) + y + z(-1)
Solving these inequalities and the constraints p+q+r=1 and x+y+z =1, we can find that the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (p,q,r) = (1/3,1/3,1/3) and (x,y,z) = (1/3,1/3,1/3)
In summary, the game has three pure strategy Nash equilibria (U, L), (M, C) and (D, R) and one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (p,q,r) = (1/3,1/3,1/3) and (x,y,z) = (1/3,1/3,1/3) where player 1 chooses U, M, D with probability 1/3 each and player 2 chooses L, C, R with probability 1/3 each.
