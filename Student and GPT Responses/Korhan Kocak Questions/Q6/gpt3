To find the pure and mixed strategy Nash equilibria for the given games, we first need to find the best response for each player for each strategy of the other player.

For player 1 (top row):
- If player 2 plays strategy L (left column), player 1's best response is to play strategy U (2,2) as it gives them a higher payoff than playing strategy D (6,4)
-If player 2 plays strategy R (right column), player 1's best response is to play strategy U (2,4) as it gives them a higher payoff than playing strategy D (0,1)

For player 2 (bottom row):
- If player 1 plays strategy U (top row), player 2's best response is to play strategy L (2,2) as it gives them a higher payoff than playing strategy R (2,4)
- If player 1 plays strategy D (bottom row), player 2's best response is to play strategy R (6,4) as it gives them a higher payoff than playing strategy L (0,1)

From this, we can see that there is one pure strategy Nash equilibrium: (U, L) where player 1 plays strategy U and player 2 plays strategy L.

To find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we need to check for any probability distributions over the strategies that result in no player being able to improve their payoff by choosing a different strategy.

For player 1, weFrom this, we can see that there is one pure strategy Nash equilibrium: (U, L) where player 1 plays strategy U and player 2 plays strategy L.

To find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we need to check for any probability distributions over the strategies that result in no player being able to improve their payoff by choosing a different strategy.

For player 1, we can see that if they mix their strategy by playing U with probability p and D with probability (1-p), player 2 will always play strategy L. Player 1's expected payoff will be:
p(2,2) + (1-p)(6,4) = (2p,2p) + (6-6p,4-4p) = (2p+6-6p,2p+4-4p) = (6-4p,6-2p)

For player 2, if they mix their strategy by playing L with probability q and R with probability (1-q), player 1 will always play strategy U. Player 2's expected payoff will be:
q(2,2) + (1-q)(2,4) = (2q,2q) + (2-2q,4-4q) = (2q+2-2q,2q+4-4q) = (2,4-2q)

For player 1 to not have any incentive to change their strategy, their expected payoffs for playing U and D should be equal. This means that (6-4p) = (6-2p) => p = 1/2.
For player 2 to not have any incentive to change their strategy, their expected payoffs for playing L and R should be equal. This means that (2) = (4-2q) => q = 1/2.

Therefore, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (p=1/2, U; q=1/2, L) where player 1 plays strategy U with probability 1/2 and strategy D with probability 1/2, and player 2 plays strategy L with probability 1/2 and strategy R with probability 1/2. This means that neither player has any incentive to deviate from their mixed strategy as they are already receiving the highest expected payoff possible given the other player's mixed strategy.

In summary, there is one pure strategy Nash equilibrium (U, L) and one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (p=1/2, U; q=1/2, L) for the given games with vNM preferences.
