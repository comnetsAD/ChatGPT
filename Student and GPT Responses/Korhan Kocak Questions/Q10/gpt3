This game can be modeled as a strategic form game, where each player (Colonel Blotto and the rebel group) has two strategies (deploying their troops to Pass 1 or Pass 2). The payoff matrix can be represented as follows:

       			 Pass 1 (Colonel Blotto)     Pass 2 (Colonel Blotto)
Pass 1 (Rebel Group)   	 -1, -1 				 1, -1
Pass 2 (Rebel Group)   	 -1, 1  				 1, 1

To find the Nash equilibria, we need to find the strategies where neither player has an incentive to deviate from their chosen strategy given the other player's strategy.

For Colonel Blotto:
If the rebels deploy their troops to Pass 1, Colonel Blotto's best response is to deploy his troops to Pass 2 (1, -1)
If the rebels deploy their troops to Pass 2, Colonel Blotto's best response is to deploy his troops to Pass 1 (-1, 1)

For the rebel group:
If Colonel Blotto deploys his troops to Pass 1, the rebel group's best response is to deploy their troops to Pass 2 (1, -1)
If Colonel Blotto deploys his troops to Pass 2, the rebel group's best response is to deploy their troops to Pass 1 (-1, 1)

From this, we can see that there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria in this game: (Pass 1, Pass 2) and (Pass 2, Pass 1) where Colonel Blotto deploys his troops to Pass 1 and the rebel group deploys their troops to Pass 2, and vice versa.

Additionally, there is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium where both players randomize their strategy with probability 1/2. For example, Colonel Blotto plays Pass 1 with probability 1/2 and Pass 2 with probability 1/2, and the rebel group also plays Pass 1 with probability 1/2 and Pass 2 with probability 1/2. In this case, neither player has an incentive to deviate from their mixed strategy as they are already receiving the highest expected payoff possible given the other player's mixed strategy.

It is worth noting that in this game, the pure strategy Nash equilibria are not Pareto efficient, as both players would be better off if they both deployed their troops to the same pass, resulting in a draw. However, this is not a Nash equilibrium as one player would have an incentive to deviate and secure a victory.

In summary, there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria (Pass 1, Pass 2) and (Pass 2, Pass 1) and one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium where both players randomize their strategy with probability 1/2.
