There are no dominant strategy, there is one NEq (Up; Right) (2; 5).

Let’s look for a mixed strategy.

U1(U) = U1(D).
2(p) + 2 (1 - p) = 1(p) + 1(1 - p).
p=Ø

U2(L) = U2(R).
3(q) + 4 (1 - q) = 5(q) + 2(1 - q).
q = ½  

There is no Nash equilibrium in mixed strategy (there is no mixture that would leave both players indifferent).
