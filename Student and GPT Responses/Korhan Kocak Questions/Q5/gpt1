A pure strategy Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy while the other players keep theirs fixed. A mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a probability distribution over pure strategies for each player, such that no player can improve their expected outcome by changing their probability distribution while the other players keep theirs fixed.
In this game, player 1 has two pure strategies U and D, and player 2 has two pure strategies L and R.
First, we will consider the pure strategy Nash equilibrium.
If player 1 chooses U, player 2 will choose R to get the highest payoff of 7. If player 1 chooses D, player 2 will choose L to get the highest payoff of 7. Therefore, (U, R) and (D, L) are both pure strategy Nash equilibria.
Now, we will consider the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.
Player 1 can assign probabilities p and 1-p to strategy U and D respectively, and player 2 can assign probabilities q and 1-q to strategy L and R respectively.
Player 1's expected payoff from strategy U is 4p + 7(1-p) and from strategy D is 7p + 1(1-p). Therefore, the best response of player 1 is to choose strategy U if 4p + 7(1-p) >= 7p + 1(1-p) and strategy D otherwise. Which leads to p >= 3/5
Similarly, player 2's expected payoff from strategy L is 4q + 1(1-q) and from strategy R is -3q + 7(1-q). Therefore, the best response of player 2 is to choose strategy L if 4q + 1(1-q) >= -3q + 7(1-q) and strategy R otherwise. Which leads to q >= 3/5
Therefore, (p, q) = (3/5, 3/5) is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.
In summary, the game has two pure strategy Nash equilibria (U, R) and (D, L) and one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (p, q) = (3/5, 3/5) where player 1 chooses U with probability 3/5 and D with probability 2/5 and player 2 chooses L with probability 3/5 and R with probability 2/5.
