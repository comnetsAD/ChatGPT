The First Number in each parentheses corresponds to player 1’s payoff, the second number corresponds to player 2’s payoff. 

We start by finding each player’s best responses, Down is a dominant strategy for player 1, Right is a dominant strategy for player 2.

In this game, there is a unique Nash Equilibria = (1; 1) -> (Down; Right)
(The interaction of tho the dominant strategy/Best responses.

Let us search for a mixed strategy Nash equilibria
Player 1's strategies will be associated with positive probabilities (p) and (1 - p) for Up and Down respectively.
Player 2's strategies will be associated with positive probabilities (q) and (1 - q).

For a mixed strategy to exist, players need to make each other indifferent between their strategies.
U1(U) = U1(D).
4(p) + (-3)(1-p) = 7(p) + (1-p)
4p - 3 + 3p = 6p + 1
p=4

There is no mixture that would leave both players indifferent. There is no mixture strategy for this game.
