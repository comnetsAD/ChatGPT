In a game with vNM preferences, a pure strategy Nash equilibrium is a pair of strategies (one for each player) such that no player can improve their payoff by changing their strategy while the other player keeps their strategy. A mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a pair of probability distributions over strategies such that no player can improve their expected payoff by changing their strategy while the other player keeps their strategy.

To find the pure strategy Nash equilibria, we can check for each player whether they have a dominant strategy, which is a strategy that always gives them a higher payoff than any other strategy regardless of the other player's strategy.

For player 1, the strategy U is a dominant strategy because it yields a payoff of 4 regardless of player 2's strategy.
For player 2, the strategy R is a dominant strategy because it yields a higher payoff than L regardless of player 1's strategy.

Therefore, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (U, R) where player 1 plays U and player 2 plays R.

To find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we can check whether there is no incentive for either player to deviate from their mixed strategy, given the other player's mixed strategy.

Let's say player 1 plays U with probability p, and D with probability 1-p and player 2 plays L with probability q and R with probability 1-q.

Player 1's expected payoff is p(4) + (1-p)(7) and player 2's expected payoff is q(-3) + (1-q)(1).

Player 1's best response is to play U with probability 1 and Player 2's best response is to play R with probability 1. Therefore, there is no mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for this game.

In summary, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is (U, R) and there is no mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.
