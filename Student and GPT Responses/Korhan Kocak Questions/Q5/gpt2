A pure strategy Nash equilibrium is a strategy combination where no player can improve their payoff by switching to a different strategy. A mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a probability distribution over strategies for each player, such that no player can improve their expected payoff by switching to a different probability distribution.
To find the pure strategy Nash equilibria, we can check if there are any strategy combinations where neither player can improve their payoff by switching to a different strategy.
In this case, we can see that there is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium.
To find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we can use the following process:
1. For each player, find their best response to the other player's mixed strategy by calculating the expected payoffs for each pure strategy.
2. Set each player's mixed strategy as the probability distribution that maximizes their expected payoffs from step 1.
3. Check if the mixed strategy from step 2 is a Nash equilibrium by verifying that no player can improve their expected payoff by switching to a different probability distribution.

For player 1:
- The expected payoff of playing strategy U is (p * 4) + ((1-p) * 7)
- The expected payoff of playing strategy D is (p * -3) + ((1-p) * 1)

Player 1 will choose strategy U if 4p + 7(1-p) > -3p + 1(1-p)
This is true if p < 3/5
Player 1 will choose strategy D if -3p + 1(1-p) > 4p + 7(1-p)
This is true if p > 3/5

So, the best response for player 1 is to play U with probability p < 3/5, and play D with probability p > 3/5.
For player 2:
- The expected payoff of playing strategy L is (p * 4) + ((1-p) * -3)
- The expected payoff of playing strategy R is (p * 7) + ((1-p) * 1)

Player 2 will choose strategy L if 4p + -3(1-p) > 7p + 1(1-p)
This is true if p < 2/5
Player 2 will choose strategy R if 7p + 1(1-p) > 4p + -3(1-p)
This is true if p > 2/5
So, the best response for player 2 is to play L with probability p < 2/5, and play R with probability p > 2/5.
Now we need to check if these mixed strategies are a Nash equilibrium, which means no player will want to deviate from their mixed strategy.
Player 1 has no incentive to deviate from their mixed strategy because no matter what strategy Player 2 plays, player 1's expected payoff is greater or equal to the expected payoff from any other strategy.
Player 2 also has no incentive to deviate from their mixed strategy because no matter what strategy Player 1 plays, player 2's expected payoff is greater or equal to the expected payoff from any other strategy.
Therefore, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is
Player 1: U with probability p < 3/5, D with probability p > 3/5
Player 2: L with probability p < 2/5, R with probability p > 2/5
It's important to note that a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is not unique, there could be other probability distributions that also form a Nash equilibrium.
