There are no dominant strategy nor pure Nash equilibrium in this game.

Let’s try to find a mixed strategy where both players are indifferent to their opponent actions. 

Let player 2 play L with (q) and R with (1 - q); if player 1 best responds with a mixed strategy, player 2 must make him indifferent between playing U or D.

U1(U) = U1(D).
1(p) + 4 (1 - p) = 3(p) + 2(1 - p).
p=½ 

(½; ½)

Likewise, player 1 must randomize to make player 2 indifferent. 

U2(L) = U2(R).
4(q) + 2 (1 - q) = 1(q) + 3(1 - q).
p=¼ 

(¼; ¾)

The mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is ((½; ½), ¼; ¾)).
