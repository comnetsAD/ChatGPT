The given game is a normal form game, which means that each player has a set of strategies and the outcome of the game depends on the combination of strategies chosen by both players. In this case, the players are U and D and the strategies are L and R. The payoffs are given in the form of (x, y), where x represents the payoff for player U and y represents the payoff for player D.
To find the pure and mixed strategy Nash equilibria for this game, we need to consider the best response for each player given the strategy chosen by the other player.
For player U:
If player D chooses strategy L, then player U's best response is strategy L, as it gives them a payoff of 1, which is higher than the payoff of 3 for strategy R.
If player D chooses strategy R, then player U's best response is strategy R, as it gives them a payoff of 4, which is higher than the payoff of 2 for strategy L.
For player D:
If player U chooses strategy L, then player D's best response is strategy R, as it gives them a payoff of 3, which is higher than the payoff of 2 for strategy L.
If player U chooses strategy R, then player D's best response is strategy L, as it gives them a payoff of 2, which is higher than the payoff of 3 for strategy R.
From this analysis, we can see that there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria in this game: (L, R) and (R, L).
For mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we can consider the probability of playing each strategy as a variable. Let x be the probability of playing strategy L for player U and y be the probability of playing strategy L for player D.
For player U, their expected payoff for strategy L is x(1) + (1-x)(4) and expected payoff for strategy R is x(4) + (1-x)(1).
For player D, their expected payoff for strategy L is y(3) + (1-y)(2) and expected payoff for strategy R is y(2) + (1-y)(3)
We set the expected payoff for both strategies equal to each other, and solve the system of equations.
x(1) + (1-x)(4) = x(4) + (1-x)(1)
y(3) + (1-y)(2) = y(2) + (1-y)(3)
This system of equations gives us x = 0.25, y = 0.75
Therefore, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is (0.25, L) and (0.75, L)
In summary, the pure strategy Nash equilibria for this game are (L, R) and (R, L), and the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is (0.25, L) and (0.75, L).
