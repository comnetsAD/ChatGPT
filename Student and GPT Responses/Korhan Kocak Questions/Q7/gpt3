A strategy is a pure strategy if it assigns a single action to each player. A strategy is a mixed strategy if it assigns a probability distribution over the actions to each player. A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally switching to another strategy.

To find the pure strategy Nash equilibria for this game, we can simply check for each player's strategy which action maximizes their payoff for every possible action of the opponent.

For player 1 (row player), the strategy U maximizes their payoff against strategy L of player 2 (column player) with a payoff of 4, and against strategy R with a payoff of 1. Similarly, for player 2, the strategy L maximizes their payoff against strategy U of player 1 with a payoff of 4, and against strategy D with a payoff of 3.

Therefore, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (U, L) with payoffs (1, 4) for player 1 and (4, 1) for player 2.

To find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we can use the following method:
Assign a probability (p) to each action of a player
Express the expected payoffs of the opponent as a function of the assigned probabilities
Use the expected payoffs to derive the best response of the opponent and find the probability that makes it indifferent between the actions.

For player 1 (row player), let's say p(U)=x, p(D)=1-x. Then the expected payoffs for player 2 (column player) are:

E(L)=x*1+(1-x)3
E(R)=x4+(1-x)*2

Player 2's best response is to play strategy L if E(L)>E(R) and strategy R if E(R)>E(L). Therefore, we need to find the value of x that makes E(L) = E(R)

x*1+(1-x)3=x4+(1-x)*2
x=1/2

so p(U)=1/2 and p(D)=1/2

For player 2 (column player), we can do a similar process, let's say p(L)=y, p(R)=1-y. Then the expected payoffs for player 1 (row player) are:

E(U)=y*1+(1-y)3
E(D)=y4+(1-y)*2

Player 1's best response is to play strategy U if E(U)>E(D) and strategy D if E(D)>E(U). Therefore, we need to find the value of y that makes E(U) = E(D)

y*1+(1-y)3=y4+(1-y)*2
y=1/2

so p(L)=1/2 and p(R)=1/2

Thus, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (1/2, 1/2) for player 1 and (1/2, 1/2) for player 2.

In summary, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (U, L) with payoffs (1, 4) for player 1 and (4, 1) for player 2. And the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (1/2, 1/2) for both players.
