A pure strategy Nash equilibrium is a strategy where neither player has an incentive to change their strategy given the strategy of the other player. A mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a combination of strategies where neither player has an incentive to change their strategy given the strategy of the other player.
To find the pure strategy Nash equilibria, we check each strategy for each player to see if it is a best response to the other player's strategy.
For player 1, their best response to player 2's strategy L is to play U, because it results in a higher payoff than playing D. Similarly, their best response to player 2's strategy R is to play D. Therefore, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (U, L) and (D, R) where player 1 plays U and player 2 plays L or player 1 plays D and player 2 plays R.
For player 2, their best response to player 1's strategy U is to play R, because it results in a higher payoff than playing L. Similarly, their best response to player 1's strategy D is to play L. Therefore, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (U, R) and (D, L) where player 1 plays U or D and player 2 plays R or L respectively.
To find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we need to check the expected payoffs for each player given the other player's mixed strategy.
Let x be the probability that player 1 plays U and y be the probability that player 2 plays L. Then the expected payoff for player 1 is 1x + 3(1-x) and the expected payoff for player 2 is 4y + 2(1-y). For player 1 to be indifferent between playing U and D, we must have 1x + 3(1-x) = 4(1-x) + 3x, which simplifies to x = 1/3.
Similarly, let z be the probability that player 2 plays R. Then the expected payoff for player 1 is 4x + 3(1-x) = 4(1/3) + 3(2/3) = 2 and the expected payoff for player 2 is 2z + 3(1-z) = 2z + 3. For player 2 to be indifferent between playing R and L, we must have 2z + 3(1-z) = 4y + 2(1-y) = 4(1/3) + 2(2/3) = 2, which simplifies to z = 1/3.
Therefore, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (x, y, z) = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) where player 1 plays U with probability 1/3, player 2 plays L with probability 1/3 and plays R with probability 1/3.
