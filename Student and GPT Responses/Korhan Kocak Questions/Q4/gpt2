In this variant of one-dimensional electoral competition, we have two candidates, A and B, who are trying to win the most electoral college votes. The game can be represented as a two-stage game, where the first stage is the candidates choosing their policy positions and the second stage is the citizens voting.
In the first stage, the candidates will choose their policy positions based on the median's favorite positions in each state, m1 and m2. Since m2 < m1, it is clear that candidate A will choose a policy position closer to m2 and candidate B will choose a policy position closer to m1.
In the second stage, the citizens in state 1 will vote for candidate B and the citizens in state 2 will vote for candidate A. This is because candidate B is closest to the median's favorite position in state 1 and candidate A is closest to the median's favorite position in state 2.
Given this outcome, the candidates will have no incentive to deviate from their chosen policy positions. Therefore, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium of the game is for candidate A to choose a policy position closest to m2 and candidate B to choose a policy position closest to m1.
It is worth noting that in this game, there is only one pure strategy Nash equilibrium, as the candidates will not gain any advantage by choosing any other positions, as it will not change the outcome of the voting stage.
