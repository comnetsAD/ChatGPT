A pure strategy Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy while the other players keep theirs fixed.
In this game, each candidate is choosing a single policy position. Let x1 and x2 be the policy positions chosen by the two candidates, respectively.
The candidate's payoffs are determined by the number of electoral college votes they receive. For candidate 1, this is:
(1) 100(x1 - m1)^2 + 80(x2 - m2)^2
For candidate 2, this is:
(2) 100(x2 - m1)^2 + 80(x2 - m2)^2
We can find the pure strategy Nash equilibrium by setting the derivative of each player's payoff with respect to their own strategy equal to zero, and solving for their strategy.
Taking the derivative of (1) with respect to x1, we get:
-200x1 + 200m1 = 0
So, x1 = m1.
Taking the derivative of (2) with respect to x2, we get:
-200x2 + 200m1 + 80 = 0
So, x2 = (200m1 + 80) / 200
Thus, in this game, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (x1, x2) = (m1, (200m1 + 80) / 200).
Therefore the candidates will always choose the median position of the state that gives them the most electoral votes.
