The regular expression that exactly models the language of hexadecimal numbers is:
^([1-9]|[A-F]|[A-F][0-9]|[1-9][0-9])+$
This regular expression allows for strings that start with any of the hexadecimal digits (0-9, A-F) and continue with any combination of those digits. It doesn't allow irrelevant initial zeroes as in 00019AF0A.
Explanation:
^ indicates the start of the string
[1-9] matches any digit between 1 and 9
[A-F] matches any uppercase letter between A and F
[A-F][0-9] matches any uppercase letter between A and F followed by any digit between 0 and 9
[1-9][0-9] matches any digit between 1 and 9 followed by any digit between 0 and 9
matches one or more of the preceding characters or group
$ indicates the end of the string
The brackets ()+ indicate that the preceding characters or group must occur one or more times.
This regular expression will match strings such as "12FD", "FFFFFFFF" and "A", but it will not match strings such as "00019AF0A" or "01A".
