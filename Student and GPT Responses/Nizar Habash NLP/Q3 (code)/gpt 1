A regular expression that exactly models the languages of hexadecimal numbers is:

^[0-9A-F]+$
This regular expression matches strings that:
start with a character from the set [0-9A-F] (using the caret ^ to indicate the start of the string)
are followed by one or more characters from the set [0-9A-F] (using the plus sign + to indicate one or more occurrences)
end with a character from the set [0-9A-F] (using the dollar sign $ to indicate the end of the string)
This regular expression will match any valid hexadecimal number, such as "12FD" or "FFFFFFFF" but will not match any irrelevant initial zeros as in "00019AF0A"
It's important to note that the regular expression will match any number of characters, so it will also match strings that have more than 8 digits in them, which is the max number of digits in a 32-bit hexadecimal number.
