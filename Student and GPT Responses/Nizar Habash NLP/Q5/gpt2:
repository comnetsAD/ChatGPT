An OOV (Out-Of-Vocabulary) word is a word that is not present in the vocabulary of a language model or a corpus of text. It is a word that the model or corpus does not recognize or has never seen before.
An example of an OOV word against a corpus of Shakespearean text would be "smartphone", as this word did not exist during Shakespeare's time, so it is not present in the vocabulary of Shakespearean text. If a model or a system is trained on Shakespearean text and is presented with the word "smartphone", it would not be able to recognize it or provide an accurate representation of it.
