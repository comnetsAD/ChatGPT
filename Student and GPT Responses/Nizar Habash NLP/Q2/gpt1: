The sentence "The chicken is too hot to eat." can have two different readings depending on the intended meaning of "hot."
The first reading is that the chicken has been cooked and is now at a high temperature, making it too hot to eat immediately.
The second reading is that the chicken has too much spice or heat added to it and is too spicy to eat.
To remove the ambiguity, the sentence can be rewritten as:
"The chicken is too hot temperature-wise to eat."
"The chicken is too spicy to eat."
This way the meaning is clear and there's no ambiguity.
