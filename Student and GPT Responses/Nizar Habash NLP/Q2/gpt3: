 

The sentence "The chicken is too hot to eat" can have two readings, which are:
The chicken is so hot that it cannot be eaten.
The chicken is too warm to be comfortable to eat.
Reading 1 suggests that the temperature of the chicken is too high to eat safely. Reading 2 suggests that the temperature of the chicken is not too high, but it's not cool enough to be comfortable to eat.
To remove the ambiguity, the sentence could be rewritten as:
"The chicken is too hot to touch, let alone eat." (meaning 1)
"The chicken is not cooled down enough to be comfortable to eat." (meaning 2)
By providing more context and using different words, the meaning of the sentence becomes clear and the ambiguity is removed.
