To build a cross-lingual question-answering system for Arabic-to-Finnish using Lextrista’s English-only IR system, I would follow these steps:
Translate the query from Arabic to English using the machine translation system I built in the previous mission. This will allow me to use Lextrista’s English-only IR system to search for relevant documents.
Retrieve relevant documents in Finnish using Lextrista’s English-only IR system.
Translate the relevant documents from Finnish to English using the machine translation system I built in the previous mission.
Extract the most important information from the translated documents using a Text summarization tool. This can be done by using pre-trained models such as T5, BERT and GPT-3.
Translate the summary from English to Finnish using the machine translation system I built in the previous mission.
Finally, I would use the tool to evaluate the system by measuring the quality of the summaries generated using metrics such as ROUGE and BLEU, as well as performing human evaluation.
It's important to note that using a machine translation system and a text summarization tool to generate the summaries, might not be the best solution and the performance might not be as good as using a specific summarization tool for Finnish, but with limited resources and time, this approach could still be effective.
