To build a cross-lingual question-answering system for Arabic-to-Finnish with a limited budget and short timeframe, I would likely use the machine translation model I built in the previous mission as a first step in the process.
I would use the Arabic query and run it through the machine translation model to translate it into Finnish. Then, I would use Lextrista's English-only IR system to search the Finnish documents, which would return a set of relevant documents.
Since I do not have a summarization tool, I would use a simple rule-based summarization technique to extract key information from the documents. This could include techniques such as extracting the first few sentences of a document, or identifying and extracting sentences that contain specific keywords.
To evaluate the performance of the system, I would use metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to measure the system's ability to retrieve relevant documents. I would also perform human evaluation by having native speakers of both languages evaluate the relevance of the documents and the quality of the summaries.
It's important to note that achieving high performance with such a short time frame and limited resources will be challenging. However, using the machine translation model I built in the previous mission and a simple rule-based summarization technique can still be an effective approach to building a cross-lingual question-answering system in this context.
