To build a machine translation system from Arabic to Finnish with limited resources and time, I would use a transfer learning approach, leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning them on the available parallel data.
Data collection: I would use the Europarl and UN corpus as they are free and contain parallel data for many languages. I would also use any additional parallel data that I can find in order to have more data to fine-tune the model.
Model selection: I would use the Moses MT system, as it is a popular open-source machine translation toolkit that has been extensively tested and has good performance.
Fine-tuning: I would fine-tune the pre-trained Moses MT model on the parallel data I collected.
Evaluation: I would evaluate the performance of the model using standard machine translation evaluation metrics such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE. I would also conduct human evaluation by having native speakers evaluate the translations for fluency and adequacy.
With the budget, I would consider to get help from professional translators to improve data quality and also to get more evaluation data from native speakers.
Overall, the success of the model will depend on the quality and quantity of the parallel data available, and the ability to fine-tune the pre-trained model effectively.
