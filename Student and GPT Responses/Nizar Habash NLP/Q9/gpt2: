Building a machine translation system from Arabic to Finnish in 2 weeks with a $1000 budget and no parallel data would be a challenging task. However, I would approach this problem in the following way:
Data collection: I would use the Europarl and UN corpus as they are freely available and contain a large amount of text in both Arabic and Finnish. I would also use any additional monolingual data that I can find in both languages to improve the quality of the translation.
Data preprocessing: I would clean and preprocess the data to remove any irrelevant information and ensure that the data is in a format that can be used for training.
Training: I would use the Moses MT system, which is a widely used open-source machine translation system. I would train the system using the collected data and fine-tune the parameters to improve the quality of the translation.
Evaluation: I would use both automatic and manual evaluation methods to assess the performance of the translation system. Automatic evaluation methods such as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE scores can be used to compare the system's output to a reference translation. I would also use manual evaluation by having human evaluators assess the quality of the translation and provide feedback.
Budget utilization: I would use the $1000 budget to buy hardware resources such as GPU and TPU to accelerate the training process, and to pay for the cloud services costs, if needed.
It is important to note that building a high-quality machine translation system is a difficult task and often requires a lot more resources and time than what is available in this scenario. The above plan is just a suggestion on how to proceed with the limited resources and time provided, and the results may not be as accurate as one could hope for.
