To compute the BLEU-2 score, we first need to compute the unigram and bigram precision for the system output ("paid it, swept it, forgot it") against each of the three references.
Unigram precision for Ref 1: 2/4 = 0.5 Bigram precision for Ref 1: 1/3 = 0.33
Unigram precision for Ref 2: 2/4 = 0.5 Bigram precision for Ref 2: 1/3 = 0.33
Unigram precision for Ref 3: 2/4 = 0.5 Bigram precision for Ref 3: 1/3 = 0.33
The final BLEU-2 score is computed by taking the harmonic mean of these precisions, multiplied by the length penalty. The length penalty is computed by taking the shortest reference length (in this case, the length of Ref 1: 4) and dividing it by the length of the system output (in this case, 3).
length penalty = 4/3
BLEU-2 = ((0.5 * 0.33)^(1/2)) * length penalty BLEU-2 = 0.41
So, the BLEU-2 score for the system output against the three references is 0.41.
