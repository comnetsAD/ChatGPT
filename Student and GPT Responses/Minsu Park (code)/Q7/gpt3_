Hint: To remove all the "a"s from a string, you can use 'that_string.replace("a", "")'. And you can call 'replace' multiple times.

def disemvowel(a_string):
    ...
    ...

# An example call to your function.  (It's often helpful to run
# an example call from time to time while you're writing a function,
# to see how it currently works.)
disemvowel("Can you read this without vowels?")

def disemvowel(a_string):
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    for vowel in vowels:
        a_string = a_string.replace(vowel, "")
    return a_string

print(disemvowel("Can you read this without vowels?"))
