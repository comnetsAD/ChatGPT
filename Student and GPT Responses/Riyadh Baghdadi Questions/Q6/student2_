While the addition operation, if the difference between values of operands is high enough, the
format of the variable is structured as a bigger number (by absolute value). That is why the
underflow occurs after shifting the floating point of the smaller to match the exponent of the
larger. Hence, it is better to sum up numbers that are close to each other to minimize the
number of bits to drop. It corresponds to right to left case as the loop start with the smallest
fraction and while the number is growing, the result accumulates accordingly, so the numbers
we add are relatively close.
