In the program, adding from left to right leads to a worse accuracy than adding from right to left. The reason for this is that when adding from left to right, the small values are added first and these small values are subject to larger relative error than larger values. When adding from right to left, the larger values are added first and these values have smaller relative error.
When adding a sequence of numbers, the numerical errors accumulate in a way that depends on the order of the additions. This is due to the fact that floating-point arithmetic is not associative. Therefore, the order of additions can affect the final result.
In the program, the series is a alternating harmonic series, the sum of it is log(2) and the order of numbers matters. By adding the largest numbers first and the smallest numbers last, the relative error is minimized and the final result is more accurate.
