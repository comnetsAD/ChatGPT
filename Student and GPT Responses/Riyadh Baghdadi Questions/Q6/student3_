The results of adding operands from right to left are more accurate than the result from left to
right. It means to add from smaller numbers to bigger numbers is better. Starting from the
smaller number means that the rounding of the operation starts later at the additions of bigger
numbers which the rounding wouldnâ€™t affect as much. If the operation starts on the left side,
then the rounding starts when the operands are smaller which causes the addition of smaller
operands to be not as accurate.
