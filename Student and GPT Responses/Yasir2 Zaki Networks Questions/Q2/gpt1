In a two-dimensional parity scheme, the value of the field containing the parity bits would be 1111. This is because in a two-dimensional parity scheme, parity bits are added to the information content of the packet in such a way as to ensure that the number of 1s in each row and column of the packet is even.

To determine the value of the parity bits in this case, we can consider the information content of the packet as a 4x4 matrix, with each row and column containing 4 bits. The information content of the packet can be represented as follows:

1110
0110
1001
1101

To ensure that the number of 1s in each row and column is even, we need to add parity bits to the packet such that the resulting matrix contains an even number of 1s in each row and column. We can do this by adding the parity bits 1111 to the packet, resulting in the following matrix:

1110
0110
1001
1101
1111

With the parity bits added, the number of 1s in each row and column is now even, and the packet is ready to be transmitted. The minimum-length checksum field in this case would be 4 bits long, as this is the minimum number of bits needed to ensure that the number of 1s in each row and column is even.
