Hence,  one’s complement is 11010001.

UDP takes the 1’s complement of the sum to  add it to the checksum, and if  all bits  are on,  this indicates no  errors. 

The receiver  knows if  there are errors  if  the sum contains  a zero. It  is  not possible  for a  1bit error to  go  undetected. However,  it  is possible for a 2bit  error to  go  undetected,  because the  two-bit errors  will  cancel  out each  other appear  as  though  no  error  occurred.
