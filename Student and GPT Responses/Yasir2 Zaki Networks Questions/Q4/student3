a) Because  of  additive  increase, CNWD  increases by  1 MSS every RTT until loss  is   detected: 
a. Increase to  6 MSS:  cost  1 RTT 
b. Increase to  7 MSS:  cost  2 RTT 
c. Increase to  8 MSS:  cost  3 RTT 
d. Increase to  9 MSS:  cost  4 RTT 
e. Increase to  10  MSS:  cost  5 RTT 
f. Increase to  11  MSS:  cost  6 RTT 
g. Increase to  12  MSS:  cost  7 RTT 

b)  1st RTT:  CNWD  = 5MSS 
2nd RTT:  CNWD  = 6MSS 
3rd RTT:  CNWD  = 7MSS 
4th RTT:  CNWD  = 8MSS 
5th RTT:  CNWD  = 9MSS 
6th RTT:  CNWD  = 10MSS 
The total MSS = 45MSS 
The Average Throughout  = Total CNWD  /RTT  = 45MSS/  6RTT  = 7.5
