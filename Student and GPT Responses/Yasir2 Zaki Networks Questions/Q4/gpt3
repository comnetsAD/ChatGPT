Additionally, What is the average throughout (in terms of MSS and RTT) for this connection up through time = 6 RTT? in an HTTP request message?


Assuming that TCP uses AIMD for its congestion control without slow start, and assuming that cwnd increases by 1 MSS every time a batch of ACKs is received, it will take 6 RTT for cwnd to increase from 6 MSS to 12 MSS, assuming no loss events. This is because cwnd increases by 1 MSS for every batch of ACKs received, and it takes 1 RTT for a batch of ACKs to be received.

The average throughout for this connection up through time = 6 RTT would be cwnd / RTT, or (6 MSS) / (1 RTT) = 6 MSS/RTT.

In an HTTP request message, the average throughout would depend on the size of the message and the RTT of the connection. If the HTTP request message is M bits in size and the RTT of the connection is RTT seconds, the average throughout would be M / RTT bits/second.
