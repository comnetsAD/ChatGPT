a. BitTorrent has a tit-for-tat incentive mechanism for trading meaning that to take part, peers must simultaneously be sharing and requesting packets. If it weren’t for this mechanism, many users would just be free-riders and BitTorrent would not work, because it depends on the neighbors and peers being willing to upload and download each other’s packets in order to move packets to a neighbor that Bob can retrieve from eventually. Additionally, since each user has a top-four group of peers that supplies a consistent rate of packets, if Bob does not supply any packets, he will not be a part of the top-four group and he will never receive packets from the peers. Therefore Bob would most likely not be able to receive a complete copy of the file he wants. 

b. If Bob uses a range of IP addresses and sets up one peer to learn the torrent identifier used for that torrent, he can query the DHT using the torrent identifier to find the peer that is responsible for the torrent identifier. Once this is done, he will have a list of peers in the torrent and can target peers that are not being contacted by the other IPs he is using so that he can have more peers (with the chance of supplying unique chunks) at a given time and therefore get the file more quickly.
