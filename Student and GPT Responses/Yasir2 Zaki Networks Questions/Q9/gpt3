Bob further claims that he can further make his "free-riding" more efficient by using a collection of multiple computers (with distinct IP addresses) in the computer lab in his department. How can he do that?


It is possible for Bob to receive a complete copy of the file shared by the swarm without uploading any data to other peers, but it is unlikely that he will be able to do so.

In a BitTorrent swarm, peers can download data from other peers in the swarm, but they are also expected to upload data to other peers in the swarm in return. This ensures that the data is distributed evenly among the peers and helps to prevent the network from becoming congested.

If Bob does not want to upload any data to other peers, he is essentially freeloading off of the other peers in the swarm. This can lead to an uneven distribution of data within the swarm and can cause the network to become congested, as other peers may not be receiving the data they need in order to continue downloading.

In addition, many BitTorrent clients implement mechanisms to prevent free-riding, such as requiring a minimum amount of data to be uploaded before allowing a peer to download. This can make it difficult for Bob to receive a complete copy of the file without uploading any data to other peers.

As for Bob's claim that he can use multiple computers to make his free-riding more efficient, this is not a good idea. Using multiple computers with distinct IP addresses to free-ride in a BitTorrent swarm is considered unethical and is often referred to as "IP spoofing." It can lead to a poor user experience for other members of the swarm and can be considered a form of abuse. It is generally not recommended to engage in this behavior.
