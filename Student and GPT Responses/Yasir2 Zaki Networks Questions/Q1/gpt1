The value of the CRC for the given generator G and data D can be calculated by performing a long division of D by G. In this case, the division would be as follows:

1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0
1 0 0 1 1
 
1 0 0 1 1
1 0 0 1 1
 
0 0 0 1 1
The remainder of this division is 011, which is the value of the CRC.
