Time = size / speed
Time that first packet arrives = 80 + (S/R) x 2

One packet is then received every 80 + S/R
File size = F

The delay in sending the whole file is thus:

d = 80 + (S/R) x 2 + (F/S - 1) x (80 + S/R) = (80 + S/R)(2 + F/S - 1) = (80 + S/R)(F/S + 1)

To get the minimum value of delay, we take the derivative and equate it to zero:

deltad = F/R x (1/S - 40 + S/S^2) + 1/R = 0

S = sqrt(40) F
