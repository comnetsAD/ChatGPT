The time it takes to transmit a packet of L bits on a link with transmission rate R bps is L / R seconds.

The total time it takes to transmit the file from Host A to Host B is the sum of the transmission times for each of the three links. Therefore, the total time it takes to transmit the file is:

T = (L / R) + (L / R) + (L / R) = 3 * (L / R)

We want to minimize the total time T, so we want to minimize the value of L. Since L = 80 + S, we want to minimize the value of S.

To minimize the value of S, we need to find the value of S that minimizes the packet size L while still being able to transmit the file. Since the file is made up of segments of S bits, we need to ensure that the value of S is large enough to transmit the entire file.

If we let N be the number of segments in the file, then the total size of the file is N * S bits. Therefore, to transmit the entire file, we need to have S >= F / N.

Therefore, to minimize the delay of moving the file from Host A to Host B, we need to choose the value of S that satisfies the following two conditions:

1. S >= F / N (to transmit the entire file)
2. S is as small as possible (to minimize the packet size L)

We can satisfy these conditions by setting S equal to the ceiling of F / N. The ceiling of a number is the smallest integer that is greater than or equal to the number. For example, the ceiling of 3.2 is 4, and the ceiling of 4.9 is 5.

In Python, we can use the math.ceil function to calculate the ceiling of a number:

Copy code
import math

S = math.ceil(F / N)
This will ensure that S is large enough to transmit the entire file, while also being as small as possible to minimize the packet size L.
