Here is a chart showing the minimum distribution time for each combination of N and u for both client-server distribution and P2P distribution:

N u Client-server (min) P2P (min)
10  300 Kbps  52.5  1.5
10  700 Kbps  23.846  0.769
10  2 Mbps  7.5 0.25
100 300 Kbps  525 15
100 700 Kbps  238.46  7.69
100 2 Mbps  75  2.5
1,000 300 Kbps  5250  150
1,000 700 Kbps  2384.6  76.9
1,000 2 Mbps  750 25

To calculate the minimum distribution time for each combination of N and u, we can use the following formulas:

Client-server distribution:
T = F / (N * di)

P2P distribution:
T = F / (N * di + (N - 1) * u)

In these formulas, T is the minimum distribution time, F is the size of the file (15 Gbits), N is the number of peers, di is the download rate of each peer (2 Mbps), and u is the upload rate of each peer.
