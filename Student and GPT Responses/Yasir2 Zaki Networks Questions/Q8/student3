Client-Server Distribution time

Dcs - distribution time for the client-server architecture
- server must transmit one copy of the file to each of the N peers (NF bits); time to distribute is based on server's upload rate Us, and is minimum NF/Us
- dmin - download rate of peer with lowest download rate (dmin = min{d1,d2,...,dN}); This peer cannot obtain the entire file in less than F/dmin, hence minimum distribution time is at least F/dmin

Formula: Dcs = max {NF/Us, F/dmin}
N = 10 or 100 or 1000
F = 15 Gbits
Us = 30 Mbps
dmin = di = 2 Mbps


          	         10        100          1000
300Kbps    7680      51200        512000   
700Kbps    7680      51200        512000
2Mbps      7680      51200        512000


P2P Distribution time

- in the case the upload time of each peer matters; we have three cases for the upload time of peer: Up=300Kbps (0.3 Mbps), or Up = 700 Kbps (0.7 Mbps), or Up = 2 Mbps

Formula used: Dp2p = max {F/Us, F/dmin, NF/(Us + (U1+U2+...+UN))},
where only u1, u2, ... vary from Dcs model above.

The results are follows: (note that because of the rounded down or up conversion of upload speeds, the results might not be 100 accurate).

            10        100          1000
300Kbps    7680      25600        46545.45455   
700Kbps    7680      15360        21041.09589
2Mbps      7680       7680          7680
