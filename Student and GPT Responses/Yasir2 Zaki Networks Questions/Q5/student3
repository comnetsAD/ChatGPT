In a NAK-protocol the receiver only realizes that it missed a packet when the following packet is received. Therefore if transmission of packets is infrequent, it could take a long time for the receiver to realize that it never received the packet it should have and for the correct packet to be sent. 

If rapid transmission takes place with few losses, then few NAKs would be sent, freeing bandwidth and presenting an advantage over ACK-protocols
