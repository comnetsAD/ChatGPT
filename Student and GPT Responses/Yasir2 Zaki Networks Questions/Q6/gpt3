In the rdt3.0 protocol, ACK packets do not require sequence numbers because they are only used to acknowledge the receipt of a packet, and do not contain any data themselves.

In rdt3.0, each packet sent from the sender to the receiver has a unique sequence number, which is used to identify the packet and ensure that it is delivered in the correct order. The receiver uses the ACK field in the ACK packet to acknowledge the receipt of the packet with the corresponding sequence number.

Since ACK packets do not contain any data and are only used to acknowledge the receipt of a packet, they do not need to have their own sequence numbers. Instead, they can simply use the ACK field to indicate which packet they are acknowledging. This helps to reduce the overhead of the protocol, as ACK packets are smaller and do not require additional fields for sequence numbering.

In summary, ACK packets in the rdt3.0 protocol do not require sequence numbers because they do not contain any data and are only used to acknowledge the receipt of a previously sent packet.
