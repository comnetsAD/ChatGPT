The IDE in Entrepreneurship stands for Initial Development Entrepreneur, and refers to the person who comes up with the initial idea or concept for a new business. They typically have a strong understanding of the market and industry in which they are operating, and are able to identify opportunities for new products or services. The SME, or Small and Medium Enterprise, refers to businesses that are typically smaller in size and have fewer employees than larger corporations. These businesses often operate in niche markets and are able to adapt quickly to changes in the market. Both the IDE and SME play important roles in the entrepreneurship ecosystem, with the IDE bringing new ideas to the market and the SME driving innovation and growth within their respective industries.
