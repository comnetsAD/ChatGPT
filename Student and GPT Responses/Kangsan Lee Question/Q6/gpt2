The best approach for new IT-based start-ups to aim both Islam and Chinese markets would be to conduct thorough market research and tailor their products and services to meet the specific needs and preferences of each market. Two important things to consider would be cultural sensitivity and language localization. It is crucial to understand and respect the cultural and religious values of the Muslim market, while also ensuring that all materials and communications are translated and presented in a way that is easily understandable for Chinese consumers. Additionally, building partnerships and collaborations with local businesses and influencers can also be beneficial in reaching and engaging these target markets.
