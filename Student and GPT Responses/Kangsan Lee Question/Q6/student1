An IT-based start-up should be mindful of the cultural taboos of the islamic and Chinese markets. Specifically, it should not offend some cultural norms, like the cultural clothing (i.e., hijab, abaya, or kandora) and foods, etc. Companies that have made fun with the restriction of freedom in islamic culture have failed to be accepted into the islamic markets. In China, the start-ups should appeal to how the product will facilitate the interpersonal connections. Or it could penetrate the market even further by leveraging quanxi with market actors.
