According to Stuart and Sorenson, the probability of IPOs of biotech firms is influenced by two factors: the availability of venture capital and the concentration of research institutions. They found that the presence of venture capital firms in a region increases the likelihood of a biotech firm going public, as these firms provide the necessary funding for biotech firms to develop and commercialize their products. Additionally, the concentration of research institutions in a region also increases the likelihood of a biotech firm going public, as these institutions provide the necessary knowledge and expertise for biotech firms to develop and commercialize their products. Overall, the authors conclude that the availability of venture capital and the concentration of research institutions are key drivers of the geographic distribution of entrepreneurial activity in the biotech industry.
