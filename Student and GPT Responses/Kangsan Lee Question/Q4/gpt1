According to Stuart and Sorenson, the probability of IPOs of biotech firms is influenced by two factors: the availability of venture capital in a region and the presence of a cluster of similar firms in that region. They found that regions with a high concentration of venture capital tend to have a higher probability of biotech firms going public, as venture capital firms are more likely to invest in biotech firms that have a higher likelihood of going public. Additionally, they found that regions with a cluster of similar biotech firms tend to have a higher probability of biotech firms going public, as the presence of a cluster of firms in a similar industry can lead to increased collaboration and knowledge sharing, which can improve the chances of success for individual firms.
