According to Stuart and Sorenson, the probability of IPOs of biotech firms is influenced by two factors: proximity to scientific and technological centers, and proximity to financial centers. They found that biotech firms located near scientific and technological centers, such as universities and research institutions, were more likely to go public due to the access to resources and networks that these centers provide. Additionally, biotech firms located near financial centers, such as major cities with a strong presence of venture capital firms and investment banks, were more likely to go public as they had access to the capital needed to fund their growth and expansion. Overall, the authors argue that proximity to both scientific and technological centers and financial centers plays a crucial role in the probability of a biotech firm going public.
