Two other types of intellectual property are trademarks and copyrights. Trademarks are symbols, logos, or phrases that are used to identify and distinguish a company or product from others in the market. Copyrights protect the rights of creators of original works, such as books, music, and films. They give creators the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, and display their work. Both trademarks and copyrights can be registered with the government to provide legal protection against infringement.
