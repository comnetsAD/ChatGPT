Two other types of intellectual property include trademarks and copyrights. A trademark is a symbol, word, or phrase that is used to identify and distinguish a company's products or services from those of its competitors. Trademarks can be registered with the government to give the owner exclusive rights to use the mark in connection with their goods or services. Copyrights, on the other hand, protect original works of authorship such as books, music, and software. A copyright gives the owner exclusive rights to reproduce, distribute, and display the work, as well as the right to create derivative works.
