Two other types of intellectual property are trademarks and copyrights. A trademark is a symbol, word, or phrase that identifies and distinguishes the source of goods or services from those of other parties. Trademarks are often used to protect brand names, logos, and slogans. Copyrights, on the other hand, protect original works of authorship such as books, songs, movies, and software. They give creators the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, and display their work for a certain period of time. Both trademarks and copyrights are legally enforceable and can be registered to provide additional protection.
