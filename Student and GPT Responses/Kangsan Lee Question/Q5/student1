A nascent entrepreneur is someone who is actively involved in trying to start a new company/startup and who expects to be one of the founders of the firm. This contrasts with a nascent intrapreneur, which refers to someone who is being sponsored by an existing company (i.e. different from the independent nascent entrepreneur). Finally, latent entrepreneurs refer to someone who would prefer or want to be self-employed but is currently still working for another company (i.e. thinking about becoming an entrepreneur).
