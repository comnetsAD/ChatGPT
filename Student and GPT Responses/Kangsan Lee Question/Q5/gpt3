Nascent entrepreneurs are individuals who have just started developing their entrepreneurial skills and are in the process of creating a new business or venture. Nascent intrapreneurs, on the other hand, are employees within an organization who have entrepreneurial potential and are starting to take on more responsibility and initiative within the company. Latent entrepreneurs, meanwhile, are individuals who have the potential to become entrepreneurs but have not yet taken the necessary steps to start a business. These individuals may have the skills and resources but lack the confidence or opportunity to pursue entrepreneurship.
