A nascent entrepreneur is a person who has been working in the past 12 months to build their own business where they are the owners or part owners of it after having a failed startup who did not have a positive flow of money. Nascent intrapreneurs are similar to entrepreneurs but they are already sponsored by an existing business and they have more aggressive ways of growing and have a higher expectation of growth than entrepreneurs. Latent Entrepreneurs are people who wish to be entrepreneurs in the future and still do not have any experience and are not ready to be actual entrepreneurs yet.
