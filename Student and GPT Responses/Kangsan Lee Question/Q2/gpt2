Push and pull factors refer to the reasons that drive or discourage an individual from starting their own business. Push factors are those that drive an individual to start their own business, such as dissatisfaction with current employment or a desire for financial independence. Pull factors, on the other hand, are those that attract an individual to starting their own business, such as the potential for high profits or the ability to be their own boss. Both push and pull factors play a role in an individual's decision to become an entrepreneur and should be considered when starting a business.
