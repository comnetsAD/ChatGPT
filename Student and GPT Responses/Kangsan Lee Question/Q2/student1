Push and pull factors refer to the different ways in which someone may decide to become an entrepreneur. Push factors (i.e. capability push) are more of an external thing, for example where oneâ€™s business may go bankrupt or you are pushed out of one industry so you identify another one and pursue entrepreneurial activity there. Pull factors (i.e. opportunity pull) refer more to identifying and believing in an opportunity to pursue entrepreneurial activity.
