Push and pull factors refer to the reasons why an individual may choose to start their own business or become an entrepreneur. Push factors are the reasons that push an individual away from traditional employment, such as dissatisfaction with a current job or a desire for more autonomy. Pull factors, on the other hand, are the reasons that attract an individual to entrepreneurship, such as the potential for financial success or the ability to be one's own boss. Together, these factors can influence an individual's decision to pursue entrepreneurship and can play a role in the success or failure of a business.
