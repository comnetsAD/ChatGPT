Push and pull factors refer to the forces that drive individuals to start their own business or to pursue entrepreneurship. Push factors are the negative aspects of an individual's current situation that motivate them to start their own business, such as dissatisfaction with their current job or lack of career advancement opportunities. Pull factors, on the other hand, are the positive aspects of entrepreneurship that attract individuals, such as the potential for financial gain, autonomy, and the ability to pursue one's passion. Together, push and pull factors play a crucial role in shaping an individual's decision to start their own business.
