A liquidity event, such as an initial public offering (IPO) or acquisition, can be considered an exit for the company's shareholders and investors because it allows them to liquidate their shares and receive a return on their investment. Even though the original founder may still be running the company, they may also choose to sell some or all of their own shares during the event, which can be seen as an exit for them as well. Additionally, a liquidity event can bring significant changes to the company's ownership structure and management, which can also be seen as a form of exit for the original founder. Overall, a liquidity event can be considered an exit because it provides an opportunity for shareholders and investors to exit the company and realize a return on their investment.
