Liquidity events, which are IPOs and acquisitions, can still be considered as “exit strategies” even though the founder is still part of the business because you are no longer necessarily in charge. IPOs involve giving some of your stocks that were once privately owned to the public while acquisitions typically means you are being absorbed or bought by a more powerful/bigger business. Similarly, this makes it easier for the founders to potentially move on to new ventures.
