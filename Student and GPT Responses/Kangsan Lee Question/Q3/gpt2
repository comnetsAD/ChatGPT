A liquidity event, such as an IPO or acquisition, can be considered an exit for the original founder even if they are still running the company because it allows them to monetize their ownership stake in the company. This means they are able to convert their equity into cash, which can provide them with financial security and freedom to pursue other ventures. Additionally, a liquidity event also marks a significant milestone in the company's growth and development, and can signal a shift in the company's direction and priorities. Overall, a liquidity event can be seen as an exit for the original founder because it allows them to reap the rewards of their hard work and dedication, while also opening up new opportunities and possibilities.
