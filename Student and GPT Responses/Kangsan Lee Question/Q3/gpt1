A liquidity event, such as an initial public offering (IPO) or a sale of the company, can be regarded as an exit for the original founder even if they continue to run the company because it allows them to monetize their equity and potentially reap significant financial rewards. Additionally, a liquidity event can also signal a significant shift in the ownership and control of the company, potentially giving the original founder less decision-making power and a reduced role in the company's direction. Furthermore, after a liquidity event, the company may be subject to increased scrutiny and pressure to deliver financial returns to public shareholders, which can lead to a change in the company's focus and priorities. Overall, a liquidity event can be a significant turning point for the original founder and the company as a whole, regardless of whether they continue to run the company.
