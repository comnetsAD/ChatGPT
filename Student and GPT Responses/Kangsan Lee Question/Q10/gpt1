The author argues that Chinese capitalism is best described as a "hybrid capitalism" against a structural or institutional approach. This means that the Chinese economic system incorporates elements of both a market economy and a planned economy, with the government playing a significant role in guiding and directing economic growth. The hybrid approach allows for a balance of private enterprise and state intervention, with the government utilizing market mechanisms to achieve its economic goals while also maintaining control over key industries and sectors. This approach also allows for greater flexibility in responding to economic challenges and opportunities, as the government can adjust its level of involvement and intervention as needed. Overall, the hybrid capitalism approach allows for a unique blend of market forces and government guidance, which has been key to China's economic success in recent years.
