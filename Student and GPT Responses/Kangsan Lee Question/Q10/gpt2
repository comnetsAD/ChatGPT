The author argues that Chinese capitalism is best described as a "hybrid capitalism" as it combines elements of both state-controlled and market-oriented systems. This approach contrasts with a structural or institutional approach, which would classify Chinese capitalism solely based on its formal institutions and structures, such as state ownership of key industries and a lack of democracy. The hybrid approach instead looks at how these formal institutions interact with market forces and informal institutions, such as the role of state-owned enterprises in the economy and the influence of guanxi networks on business practices. This approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of the complexities and evolution of Chinese capitalism.
