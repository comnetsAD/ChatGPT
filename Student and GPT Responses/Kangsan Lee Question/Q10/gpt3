In the "hybrid capitalism" approach, the author argues that Chinese capitalism is best described as a combination of state intervention and market forces. This approach focuses on the role of the government in shaping the economy and the interactions between state-owned enterprises and private businesses. It highlights the importance of understanding the unique institutional arrangements and regulations that have enabled China's economic development, rather than solely focusing on structural factors such as GDP growth or labor markets. This approach emphasizes that Chinese capitalism is distinct from Western models and cannot be fully understood through a purely market-based or institutional perspective.
