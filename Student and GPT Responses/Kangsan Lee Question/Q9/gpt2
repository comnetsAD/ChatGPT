According to Martin Ruef, the probability of form emergence is defined by two factors: structural predictors and cultural predictors. Structural predictors include the number and strength of social ties within an organization, as well as the degree of network connectedness and the presence of structural holes. Cultural predictors include the level of trust, shared norms and values, and the level of communication and information flow within the organization. Together, these two factors influence the likelihood of new forms emerging within an organization.
