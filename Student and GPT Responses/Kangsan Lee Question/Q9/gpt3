According to Martin Ruef, the probability of form emergence is defined by two factors: the strength of ties within a network and the diversity of the network. The strength of ties refers to the level of familiarity, trust, and intimacy among individuals within a network. The diversity of the network refers to the presence of different types of individuals, groups, and organizations within the network. Ruef argues that strong ties within a network can foster cooperation and coordination, but can also limit the flow of new ideas and information. In contrast, weak ties and diverse connections can facilitate the introduction of new ideas and perspectives, but can also make coordination and cooperation more difficult. Therefore, a balance of strong and weak ties, as well as a diverse network, is necessary for effective organizational innovation.
