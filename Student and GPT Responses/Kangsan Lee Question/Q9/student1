The two main factors are legitimacy and competitive effects (resource competition). Form emergence depends on legitimacy because the “legitimate” forms are the one that will be selected and adopted by different organizations within those industries. Competitive effects also play an important role because it determines the variety of forms that emerge in order to prevent too much competition between organizations. They develop in certain ways so that they have specific niches to avoid competition.
