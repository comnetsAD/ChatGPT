According to Ruef, the probability of form emergence is defined by two factors: the structural characteristics of the network, and the cultural characteristics of the organization. The structural characteristics include the density of the network, the degree of centralization, and the presence of strong ties and weak ties. The cultural characteristics include the level of trust, the level of risk-taking, and the level of experimentation. Together, these two factors determine the likelihood that new forms will emerge within an organization, and the extent to which they will be adopted and implemented.
