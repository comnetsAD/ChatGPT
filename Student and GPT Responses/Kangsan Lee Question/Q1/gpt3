In Islamic law, a partnership involving a financier and an entrepreneur is known as a mudharabah partnership. In this partnership, the financier provides the capital and the entrepreneur manages the business. The profit is shared according to a pre-agreed ratio, with the financier receiving a fixed percentage of the profit and the entrepreneur receiving the remaining percentage. However, the financier bears no liability for any losses incurred by the business. The entrepreneur is solely responsible for any losses and must make up for them from their own share of the profits or personal assets. This type of partnership encourages risk-sharing and promotes ethical business practices.
