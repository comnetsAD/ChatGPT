In Islamic law, a partnership involving a financier and an entrepreneur is known as a mudharabah partnership. In this type of partnership, the financier provides the funds for the business venture, while the entrepreneur manages and runs the business. The profit is shared between the financier and the entrepreneur according to a pre-agreed ratio, with the financier receiving a fixed percentage of the profits and the entrepreneur receiving the remaining percentage. However, if there is a loss, the financier bears the full loss and the entrepreneur is not liable. This type of partnership is based on mutual trust and cooperation, with the financier entrusting the entrepreneur with the management of the business and the entrepreneur using their skills and expertise to generate profits for both parties.
