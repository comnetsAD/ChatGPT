In Islamic law, a partnership involving a financier and an entrepreneur is known as a mudharabah partnership. In this partnership, the financier provides the capital while the entrepreneur manages the business. The profit is shared according to a pre-agreed ratio, with the financier receiving a fixed percentage of the profits and the entrepreneur receiving the remaining percentage. However, the entrepreneur bears the risk of loss and is not liable for any losses incurred by the business. This is in contrast to a traditional partnership, where all partners share in both profits and losses.
