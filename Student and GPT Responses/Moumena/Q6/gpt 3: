There are 4026 students who need lockers, and there are 805 lockers available. Since each locker can be used by only one student at a time, the maximum number of students who must share a locker is 4026 - 805 = <<4026-805=3221>>3221. Therefore, the largest number of students who must necessarily share a locker is 3221.
