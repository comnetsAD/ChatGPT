To determine the largest number of students who must necessarily share a locker, you need to find the smallest number of lockers that each student can have. To do this, divide the number of lockers by the number of students: 805 lockers / 4026 students = 0.2 lockers/student. Since each student can't have a fraction of a locker, the smallest number of lockers that each student can have is 1. Therefore, the largest number of students who must necessarily share a locker is the total number of students minus the number of lockers: 4026 students - 805 lockers = 4026-805=3221 => 3221 students.
