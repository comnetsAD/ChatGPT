To solve this problem, we can start by setting up the congruence equation:
a + 1 ≡ 2a mod 11
Then we can rearrange the terms to get:
a + 1 - 2a ≡ 0 mod 11
This simplifies to:
-a + 1 ≡ 0 mod 11
Then we can divide both sides of the equation by -1 to get:
a ≡ -1 mod 11
Since a is an integer, we want to find the smallest integer value of a that satisfies this congruence. To do this, we can add 11 to both sides of the equation to get:
a ≡ 10 mod 11
Then we can add 11 to both sides again to get:
a ≡ 21 mod 11
We can continue adding 11 to both sides until we find the smallest integer value of a that satisfies the congruence.
a ≡ 32 mod 11
a ≡ 43 mod 11
a ≡ 54 mod 11
a ≡ 65 mod 11
a ≡ 76 mod 11
a ≡ 87 mod 11
a ≡ 98 mod 11
The smallest integer value of a that satisfies the congruence is 98.
