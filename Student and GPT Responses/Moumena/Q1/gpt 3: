To solve this problem, we can start by expressing the given congruence in terms of modular arithmetic:
a + 1 ≡ 2a mod 11
a + 1 - 2a ≡ 0 mod 11
-a + 1 ≡ 0 mod 11
Then we can divide both sides by -1 to get:
a ≡ -1 mod 11
Finally, we can add 11 to both sides to find the smallest integer solution:
a ≡ 10 mod 11
Therefore, the smallest integer a > 1 that satisfies the given congruence is 10.
