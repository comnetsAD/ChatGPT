There are 10 choices for the first digit, 26 choices for the letter, and 10 choices for the second digit, for a total of 10 * 26 * 10 = 26,000 possible codes. If the factory made 6,000 parts last week, then the minimum number of parts that must have the same serial number is 6,000 / 26,000 = approximately 0.23, which is equal to approximately 1 part. Therefore, the minimum number of parts that must have the same serial number is 1.
