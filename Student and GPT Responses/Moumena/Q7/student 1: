Total number of serial number that can be generated by the given constraint is = 10 ∗ 26 ∗ 9 = 260 ∗ 9 = 2340
Since the factory made 6000 parts, the serial number has to be repeated for some of the parts.
So, the minimum number of parts that must have the same serial number is = ⌈6000/2340⌉
= ⌈ 2.564103⌉
= 3
Hence, the minimum number of parts that must have the same serial number is 3.
