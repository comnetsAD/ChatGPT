There are 10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and 26 uppercase letters (A, B, C, D, ..., Z), so there are a total of 10*26 = 260 possible serial numbers for each part. This means that on average, each serial number will appear 6000/260 = 23 times in the set of 6,000 parts.
To find the minimum number of parts that must have the same serial number, we need to find the number of parts that appears most frequently. If this number of parts is X, then X parts must have the same serial number. We can find the value of X by rounding 23 up to the nearest integer. Since 23 is already an integer, X = 23.
Thus, the minimum number of parts that must have the same serial number is 23.
