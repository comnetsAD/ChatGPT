Proof. False. Disproving with counterexamples.
Let,
A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
B = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8}
C = {1, 4, 5, 8, 9}
A − (B ∩ C) = {1, 2, 3}
(A − B) ∩ (A − C) = {2, 3}
Hence, A − (B ∩ C) ̸= (A − B) ∩ (A − C).



(A − B) ∩ (A − C) = {x | x ∈ A ∧ x ∉ B ∧ x ∉ C}

Since the left side of the equation and the right side of the equation are equal, we can conclude that A − (B ∩ C) = (A − B) ∩ (A − C).

Therefore, the statement is true.
