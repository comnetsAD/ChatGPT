Let U be the event that the urn with 6 red balls is chosen, and U be the event that the urn with 5 red balls is chosen. Thus P(U) = 1/2 and P(U) = 1/2
Let R be the event that a red ball is chosen. Given that the urn in question has a total of 9 balls, the probability of choosing a red ball is P(R|U) = 6/9. The probability of choosing a red ball in the other urn is P(R|U) = 5/13.
Applying Bayesâ€™ theorem,

P(U|R) = 26/41
