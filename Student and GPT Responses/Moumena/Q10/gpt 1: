The probability that a positive integer less than 100 picked at random has all distinct digits is equal to the number of such integers divided by the total number of integers less than 100. The total number of integers less than 100 is 99, since there are 99 positive integers less than 100. To count the number of integers with distinct digits, we first count the number of one-digit integers, which is 9 (since there are nine one-digit integers with distinct digits: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). Next, we count the number of two-digit integers with distinct digits, which is 8 (since the first digit can be any of the nine one-digit integers with distinct digits, and the second digit can be any of the eight one-digit integers with distinct digits not equal to the first digit). Therefore, the total number of integers with distinct digits is 9 + 8 = 17. The probability that a positive integer less than 100 picked at random has all distinct digits is 17/99, or approximately 0.171717.
