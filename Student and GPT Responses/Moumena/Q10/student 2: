Total number of positive integers less than 100 = 99. Let, Set A in the sample space be the set with same digits = { 11, 22, 33, 44, 55, 66, 77, 88, 99}

|A| = 9
Probability(P) = 1 −|A|/99
= 1 − 9/99
= 1 −1/11
=(11 − 1)/11
=10/11
Hence, the probability that a positive integer less than 100 picked at random has all distinct digits is 10/11 .
