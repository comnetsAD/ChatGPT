The probability that a positive integer less than 100 picked at random has all distinct digits is equal to the number of such integers divided by the total number of integers less than 100. There are 9 choices for the tens digit and 10 choices for the units digit, for a total of 90 integers with two digits. There are also 9 one-digit integers. This gives us a total of 99 integers less than 100. Of these, the number of integers with distinct digits is equal to the number of one-digit integers (9) plus the number of two-digit integers with distinct digits, which is equal to the product of the number of choices for the tens digit and the number of choices for the units digit, or 9*9 = 81. Therefore, the probability that a positive integer less than 100 picked at random has all distinct digits is 81/99, which is approximately equal to 0.8182.
