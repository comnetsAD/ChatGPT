The statement "The product of any two irrational numbers is irrational" is true.

To prove this, let's suppose that the product of two irrational numbers, x and y, is rational. This means that there exists some integers a and b, with b â‰  0, such that:

xy = a/b

Since x and y are irrational, they cannot be expressed as the ratio of two integers, so we must have a = 0. However, this means that xy = 0, which is a contradiction, since x and y are not equal to 0. Therefore, our assumption that the product of x and y is rational must be false, which means that the product of any two irrational numbers is irrational.

This proof shows that the statement "The product of any two irrational numbers is irrational" is always true.
