The statement is true.

To prove it, let's assume that the product of any two irrational numbers is irrational.

Then, suppose we have two irrational numbers x and y. We can write their product as xy.

Since x and y are both irrational, it follows that xy is irrational.

This proves that the product of any two irrational numbers is irrational.
