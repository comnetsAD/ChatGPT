The statement "If p and q are primes > 2, then pq + 1 is never prime" is actually false.

To see this, let's consider the case where p = 3 and q = 5. In this case, pq + 1 = 35 + 1 = 16, which is not prime. However, if we take p = 5 and q = 7, then pq + 1 = 57 + 1 = 36, which is also not prime.

On the other hand, if we take p = 5 and q = 11, then pq + 1 = 511 + 1 = 56, which is not prime. However, if we take p = 11 and q = 13, then pq + 1 = 1113 + 1 = 144, which is also not prime.

Therefore, the statement "If p and q are primes > 2, then pq + 1 is never prime" is false.
