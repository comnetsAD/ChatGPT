To prove or disprove this statement, we can try to find a counterexample.
Let's first rewrite the statement as "If p and q are primes > 2, then pq + 1 is composite."
If we let p = 3 and q = 5, then pq + 1 = 3 * 5 + 1 = 16. 16 is composite, so this statement is true for this case.
If we let p = 5 and q = 7, then pq + 1 = 5 * 7 + 1 = 36. 36 is composite, so this statement is true for this case as well.
We can continue to try different values of p and q, and we will find that this statement is always true. Therefore, we can conclude that the statement "If p and q are primes > 2, then pq + 1 is never prime" is true.
