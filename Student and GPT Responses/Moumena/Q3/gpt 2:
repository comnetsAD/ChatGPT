The statement "If p and q are primes > 2, then pq + 1 is never prime" is actually false.
To see this, consider the case where p = 3 and q = 5. In this case, pq + 1 = 35 + 1 = 16, which is not prime. However, if we take p = 5 and q = 7, then pq + 1 = 57 + 1 = 36, which is also not prime.
On the other hand, if we take p = 5 and q = 11, then pq + 1 = 5*11 + 1 = 56, which is prime. This shows that there do exist values of p and q such that pq + 1 is prime.
Therefore, the statement "If p and q are primes > 2, then pq + 1 is never prime" is false.
