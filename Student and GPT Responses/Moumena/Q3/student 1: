Suppose p and q are any particular but arbitrarily chosen prime numbers larger than 2. Then, both p and q are odd and by definition they can be written as p = 2k + 1 for some integer k and q = 2n + 1 for some integer n. By substitution we get pq + 1 = (2k + 1)(2n + 1) + 1 = 4kn + 2k + 2n + 1 + 1 = 4kn + 2k + 2n + 2 = 2(2kn + k + n + 1) , which means that pq + 1 is even because it can be written as 2t for some integer t = 2kn + k + n + 1. Since pq + 1 is even and bigger than 2, it has to be composite. Thus, we can conclude that pq + 1 is never prime for all primes p and q larger than 2.
