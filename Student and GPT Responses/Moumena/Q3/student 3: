Proof. Let p and q are two arbitrarily chosen prime integers that are greater than 2.
Since, p and q are primes > 2. Then, p and q are odd integers.
Thus, by the definition of odd.
p = 2k + 1
q = 2m + 1
for some unique integers k and m for which p and q prime.
Then,
pq = (2k + 1)(2m + 1)
= 4km + 2k + 2m + 1
= 2(2km + k + m) + 1

Then,
pq + 1 = 2(2km + k + m) + 1 + 1
= 4km + 2k + 2m + 2
= 2(2km + k + m + 1)
Since, (2km + k + m + 1) is an integer as k and m are integers, and the product of integer is also an integer.
Since pq+1 is even by the definition of even, it is divisible by 2.
Therefore, we can conclude that for all primes p and q primes greater than 2, (pq + 1) is never prime
