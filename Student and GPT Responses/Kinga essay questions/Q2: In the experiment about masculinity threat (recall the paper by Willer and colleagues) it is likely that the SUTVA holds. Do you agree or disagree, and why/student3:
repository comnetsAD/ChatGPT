I would agree that SUTVA likely holds in the experiment about masculinity threat. In the paper by Willer and colleagues, they studied the concept that men who are insecure about their masculinity will try to act masculine more extremely to make up for it. They argue that theoretically this is because masculinity may be more susceptible to threats than femininity as it is more clearly ‚Äúdefined‚Äù. SUTVA is the idea that a participant will react depending only on their own treatment and not others. For a situation like masculinity threat, this is almost like a direct attack on an individual and relies on their comfortability and security with themselves and their identity. If someone is comfortable with their masculinity, they would not act so extremely to a potential masculinity threat; those who are more insecure with their masculinity, would act more extremely to a potential masculinity threat (according to Willer and colleagues‚Äô hypothesis). It depends on an individual, not others, although the concept of masculinity is defined by society and reinforced upon individuals.
