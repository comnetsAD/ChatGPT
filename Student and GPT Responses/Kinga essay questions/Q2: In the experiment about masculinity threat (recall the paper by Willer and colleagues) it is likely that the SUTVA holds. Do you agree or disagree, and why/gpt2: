I am not aware of a specific study by Willer and colleagues on masculinity threat and the SUTVA (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption) holds. SUTVA is an assumption in causal inference, which states that the potential outcomes of an individual are not affected by the treatment status of others. It is a fundamental assumption for estimating causal effects using observational data. In the context of an experiment on masculinity threat, it would mean that the subjects' potential outcomes with respect to masculinity threat are not affected by the treatment status of other subjects. It is difficult for me to say whether SUTVA holds in this specific experiment without more information about the study design and methods used. However, in general, SUTVA is often a reasonable assumption to make when conducting experiments in controlled settings. When experiment is well designed and conducted, it can provide evidence that SUTVA holds. It is important to note that SUTVA is not always met in observational studies, and when it is not met, it can lead to biased estimates of causal effects. In such cases, alternative methods such as propensity score matching or instrumental variables can be used to correct for the violation of SUTVA.
