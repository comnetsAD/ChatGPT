It is likely that the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) holds in the experiment about masculinity threat that you are referencing. SUTVA is an assumption in experimental design that states that the treatment assigned to one unit does not affect the outcomes of other units. In the context of an experiment on masculinity threat, this means that the manipulation of the masculinity threat should not affect the outcomes of participants who were not exposed to the manipulation. Willer and colleagues' paper likely holds SUTVA because it is a within-subjects design, meaning that each participant is exposed to both the masculinity threat manipulation and the control condition. By comparing the participant's responses in the two conditions, the researchers are able to control for individual differences and infer causality. Additionally, the experiment likely holds SUTVA because the manipulation of masculinity threat is only presented to the participants once, meaning that the outcome of one participant's experience with the manipulation should not be affected by the experiences of other participants. In summary, I agree that SUTVA holds in the experiment about masculinity threat, because the design of the study is such that the manipulation of masculinity threat should not affect the outcomes of participants who were not exposed to the manipulation, and the design of the study allows for a within-subjects comparison of the participants' responses in the two conditions.
