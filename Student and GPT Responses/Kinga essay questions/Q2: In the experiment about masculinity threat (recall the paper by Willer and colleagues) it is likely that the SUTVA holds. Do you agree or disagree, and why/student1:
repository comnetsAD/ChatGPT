I agree with the statement that the experiment in the masculinity threat paper by Willer and his colleagues (2013) abides with the SUTVA conditions. For starters, the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) is the assumption that the response of a unit to a treatment is unaffected by the way and number of other units being treated. In this case, the Willer experiments proved that all masculinity threatened males overcompensated masculinity and ‚Äúexpressed more masculine attitudes than men whose masculinity was not [threatened]‚Äù (Willer, 1011) through making sure that subjects completed surveys individually and the threatened masculinity individuals were threatened separately and did not have a chance to compare answers nor react to an individual‚Äôs threat. Thus, units (subjects) were not influenced by other units‚Äô way of treatment or number.
