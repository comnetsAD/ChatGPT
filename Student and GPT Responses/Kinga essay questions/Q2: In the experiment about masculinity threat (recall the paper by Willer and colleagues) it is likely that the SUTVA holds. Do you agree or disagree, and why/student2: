It is likely that SUTVA holds in this experiment, since the individuals are isolated from one another, and the treatment of one individual is independent from the treatment of another. SUTVA, or the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption, supposes that the outcome of one treatment is unaffected by the assignment of treatments to other subjects. In order for SUTVA to hold, there must be no interference (one treatment must not affect the outcome of another), and there must only be one version of each treatment, so that potential outcomes are clear. Both of these are the case in Willer‚Äôs paper, since the ‚Äúthreat‚Äù treatment of one individual has no effect on another‚Äôs level of threat. In real life interactions, the same assumption are not the case since individuals are likely to draw off the insecurities and masculinities of one another. However, within the isolation of the experiment, it‚Äôs safe to assume that the element of randomized treatment provides credibility for SUTVA. Since we say that SUTVA holds in the bounds of the experiment, we can make more causal inferences from the results.
