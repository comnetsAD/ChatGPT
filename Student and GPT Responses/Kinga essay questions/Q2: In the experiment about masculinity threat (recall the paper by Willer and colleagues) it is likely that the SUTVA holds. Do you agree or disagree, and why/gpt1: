I am not aware of a specific paper by Willer and colleagues about a masculinity threat experiment in which the SUTVA (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption) holds, as you have described it. The SUTVA is an assumption used in causal inference that states that the potential outcomes of an individual are not affected by the treatment or treatments received by other individuals. In other words, it assumes that the outcomes for one person are not affected by the actions or treatments given to another person.
It is difficult for me to agree or disagree with you without more information about the experiment you are referencing. However, in general, it is possible for the SUTVA to hold in some experiments, particularly if the study design and data analysis are conducted in a way that controls for or accounts for potential interactions between individuals. On the other hand, in some studies, the SUTVA might not hold, due to the complexity of the system being studied, which might lead to spillover effect or network effect.
