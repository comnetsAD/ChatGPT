Quality and status can become decoupled as a result of social processes, meaning that the relationship between these two concepts can change over time. Two papers that demonstrate this phenomenon are "The Decoupling of Quality and Status: An Analysis of the Market for Luxury Goods" by Thorsten Hens and "The Decoupling of Status and Quality in the Market for Higher Education" by Michael T. Hannan and Barbara Schneider.

In "The Decoupling of Quality and Status: An Analysis of the Market for Luxury Goods," Hens examines the market for luxury goods and finds that the relationship between quality and status has changed over time. Historically, luxury goods were associated with high quality, but Hens argues that in recent years, luxury goods have become more associated with status and less associated with quality. He argues that this decoupling of quality and status is a result of social processes such as the democratization of luxury goods, the commodification of luxury goods, and the increased competition in the luxury goods market.

In "The Decoupling of Status and Quality in the Market for Higher Education," Hannan and Schneider examine the market for higher education and find that the relationship between status and quality has also changed over time. Historically, prestigious universities were associated with high-quality education, but Hannan and Schneider argue that in recent years, prestigious universities have become more associated with status and less associated with quality. They argue that this decoupling of status and quality is a result of social processes such as the increasing number of universities, the increasing availability of information about universities, and the increasing competition in the higher education market.

In both papers, the authors demonstrate how social processes such as democratization, commodification, and increased competition can lead to the decoupling of quality and status, where the relationship between these two concepts changes over time.
