There are several social processes that can lead to the decoupling of quality and status. Two examples of papers that demonstrate this are:

"The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism" by George Akerlof. In this paper, Akerlof argues that the existence of asymmetric information in the market can lead to the decoupling of quality and price. He uses the example of the used car market, where buyers cannot easily distinguish between good and bad cars, leading to a general decline in the quality of cars available for sale, and a decrease in the prices of the good cars, due to the difficulty of distinguishing them from the bad ones.

"Signaling Social Status with Luxury Goods: The Role of Brand Prominence" by Kees van den Bulte and Eric Bradlow. This paper examines how the display of luxury goods can signal social status and how the prominence of the brand can affect the effectiveness of this signal. The paper argues that as luxury goods become more accessible and affordable, their ability to signal status is diminished, leading to a decoupling of quality and status. The paper demonstrates that brand prominence, the degree to which the brand is known and recognized, plays a crucial role in signaling status through luxury goods. Brands that are more prominent signal higher status than less prominent brands, even if they are of the same quality.

Both papers demonstrate how social processes such as market dynamics and brand prominence can lead to the decoupling of quality and status. In the first paper, the decoupling happens due to the difficulty of distinguishing good quality products from bad quality products, and in the second paper, it happens due to the decrease in the exclusivity of luxury goods, and the role of brand prominence in signaling status.
