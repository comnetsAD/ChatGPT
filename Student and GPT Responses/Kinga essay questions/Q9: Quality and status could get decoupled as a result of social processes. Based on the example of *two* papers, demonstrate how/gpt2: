There are several social processes that can lead to the decoupling of quality and status. Here are two examples of papers that demonstrate how this can occur:

"The Matthew Effect in Science" by Robert Merton: In this paper, Merton argues that the "Matthew Effect" can lead to the decoupling of quality and status in scientific research. The Matthew Effect refers to the phenomenon where scientists with a high level of initial prestige and visibility tend to receive more credit and recognition for their work, even if their work is of lower quality than that of less well-known scientists. Merton argues that this can lead to a situation where the most highly visible and prestigious scientists are not necessarily the ones doing the best work, leading to a decoupling of quality and status.

"The Paradox of Meritocracy in Organizations" by Lauren Rivera: In this paper, Rivera examines the hiring practices of elite professional service firms and argues that meritocracy can lead to the decoupling of quality and status. Rivera found that these firms often use "cultural fit" as a key criterion for hiring, which can result in a bias towards candidates who are similar to existing employees, rather than those who are the most qualified. This can lead to a situation where the most qualified candidates are not necessarily the ones who are hired, resulting in a decoupling of quality and status.

Both of these papers illustrate how social processes can lead to the decoupling of quality and status by showing how factors such as prestige, visibility, and cultural fit can be used to evaluate performance and assign credit or recognition, rather than solely focusing on quality of work or merit.
