It depends on whose perspective you are viewing the signal: as either the giver or receiver. For the giver, cheap signals are best. For the receiver, costly signals are best. 

Take the example in class where the police officer tries to infiltrate the mafia by sending a signal to ‚Äòprove‚Äô they are one of the gang. Out of the four signals we discussed, hanging out at the gang-associated bar is the cheapest signal because it costs the giver (police officer) the least in terms of time (compared to learning the code of honour) or punishment (compared to doing cocaine, murdering someone). Murdering is the costliest signal because it costs the police officer the most (punishment- and probably emotional-wise, as they may be mentally scarred forever if they are a good police officer). 

For the police officer, giving the cheapest signal possible to fool the mafia is the best, because they can minimise the cost to self. For the mafia, receiving the costliest signal possible is best because they know that if the giver is willing to incur that cost, then they can be more confident that the newcomer is genuine (and not a fake, like the police).
