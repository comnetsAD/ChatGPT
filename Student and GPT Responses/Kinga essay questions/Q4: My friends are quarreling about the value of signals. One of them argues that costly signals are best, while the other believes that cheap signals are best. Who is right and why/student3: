Signals reveal information about our identity and position in the structure of society. ‚ÄòCostly‚Äô and ‚Äòcheap‚Äô signals encompass the sacrifice required to produce the signal. Sacrifice can be measured by time, effort, harm, cost, opportunity cost, etc. In terms of who is right in the context of this argument, it depends. From the receiver of the signal‚Äôs perspective, costly signals are best because they can only be communicated by those whose ‚ÄúType‚Äù does not correspond to the signal - providing even more information to the receiver. However, from the emitter's perspective, cheap signals are best as they are easier to emit, while still getting the information across. The idea of signaling is detailed in Kaminski‚Äôs paper regarding the games prisoners play. To the prisoners, the tests that they put the rookies through would serve as costly signals - but would be best - as they could find out who could be trusted and thereby made categorizing them easier. However, these costly signals were not the best for the rookies as they had to get beaten to prove their ‚Äútoughness‚Äù - they would probably have preferred ‚Äúcheap‚Äù signals, which would have conveyed the same information to the prisoners more easily.
