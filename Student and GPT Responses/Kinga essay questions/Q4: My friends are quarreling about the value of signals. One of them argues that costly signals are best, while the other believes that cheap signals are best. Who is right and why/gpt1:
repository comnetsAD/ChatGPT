It depends on the context of the situation. Costly signals are signals that require the signaler to invest a significant amount of resources, such as time, energy or money, to produce the signal. Cheap signals, on the other hand, are signals that are produced at a low cost.

Costly signals are often seen as more reliable indicators of the signaler's underlying traits or abilities, because the signaler must be willing to invest a significant amount of resources to produce the signal. For example, in the animal kingdom, brightly colored plumage or large antlers are often considered costly signals because they require a significant amount of energy to produce and maintain. These signals are reliable indicators of the animal's physical condition and health, which are important factors in attracting a mate.

Cheap signals, on the other hand, are signals that are produced at a low cost and may be less reliable indicators of the signaler's underlying traits or abilities. For example, in the animal kingdom, a loud call may be a cheap signal that doesn't require a significant amount of energy to produce, but it doesn't tell much about the animal's physical condition or health.

In the human context, the value of signals can vary depending on the situation. Sometimes, costly signals are more valuable because they indicate that the signaler is willing to invest a significant amount of resources to produce the signal. For example, in a job interview, a candidate with a prestigious degree or certifications is providing a costly signal that they have invested a significant amount of resources to gain the required qualifications. On the other hand, in a dating context, cheap signals such as a smile or a witty comment may be more valuable because they are easy to produce and may indicate that the signaler is approachable and friendly.

In summary, both costly and cheap signals have value depending on the context of the situation. Costly signals are often seen as more reliable indicators of the signaler's underlying traits or abilities, while cheap signals may be less reliable but can be easily produced and provide a sense of approachability.
