It is difficult to say who is right in this argument as the value of signals depends on the specific context and the goals of the sender and the receiver.

Costly signals are signals that come at a significant cost to the sender, such as the peacock's tail. These types of signals are generally considered to be more reliable indicators of the sender's quality or fitness because the sender has invested a significant amount of resources into producing the signal. For example, a male peacock with a large and colorful tail is likely to be more fit and healthy than a male peacock with a small and dull tail. These signals are often used in mating displays and courtship.

On the other hand, cheap signals are signals that come at little or no cost to the sender, such as a bird call. These types of signals are generally considered to be less reliable indicators of the sender's quality or fitness because they are relatively easy to produce. However, they can still be useful in certain contexts. For example, a bird call can be used to communicate the presence of a predator or a food source, or to attract a mate.

In general, costly signals are more reliable indicators of the sender's quality or fitness but can be less flexible and more vulnerable to deception. Cheap signals, on the other hand, are less reliable indicators but can be more flexible and less vulnerable to deception.

So, it depends on the context and the goals of the sender and the receiver. For example, if the goal is to attract a mate, costly signals may be more effective because they provide more reliable information about the sender's quality or fitness. But if the goal is to communicate the presence of a predator or a food source, cheap signals may be more effective because they are more flexible and less vulnerable to deception.
