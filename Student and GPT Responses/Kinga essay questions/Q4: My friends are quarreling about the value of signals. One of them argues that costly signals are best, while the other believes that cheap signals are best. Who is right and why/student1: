The signal is when someone discloses information about him[her]self to others which aims to show who he/she is or in other words his/her identity. The more information they reveal, the better the signal. However, determining whether a costly signal is better than a cheap signal or vice versa is another thing. It depends on the condition of each person. Signalers will tend to say that it is a cheap signal because they do not need to reveal more about their identity but can still solve the problem, vice versa. Observers or receivers will tend to say that the costly signal is better because they can get more information related to one‚Äôs identity before doing something.
