The value of signals can depend on the context and the purpose of the signal. Both costly signals and cheap signals have their own advantages and disadvantages.

Costly signals are signals that require a significant investment from the signaler, such as a large display of courtship or a dangerous or painful display of aggression. These signals are often seen as more reliable indicators of the signaler's true intentions or abilities because the signaler has invested a lot in the signal. In the animal world, for example, a large and colorful tail in male peacock is a costly signal that indicates the male's fitness, and it's also a reliable indicator of genetic quality as only healthy and strong males can afford to grow such a tail.

Cheap signals, on the other hand, are signals that require little investment from the signaler, such as a simple vocalization or a small display of color. These signals are often seen as less reliable indicators of the signaler's true intentions or abilities because the signaler has invested little in the signal. In the animal world, for example, a simple call of a bird could be a cheap signal that only indicates that the bird is around, but not much about its genetic quality or fitness.

In conclusion, it depends on the context of the signal. Costly signals can be reliable indicators of the signaler's true intentions or abilities, but may be less common or less accessible for some signalers. Cheap signals, on the other hand, are more common and accessible but may not provide as much information about the signaler's true intentions or abilities.
