It is impossible for me to know exactly what the social scientists would have found in their small world experiment because it refers to a hypothetical study that takes place in the future. However, based on the information provided, it seems that the study would be examining how gender roles and stereotypes might influence the spread of suicidal thoughts and behaviors in social networks.

One possibility is that the researchers found that, even though the overall suicide rate is the same for both genders, the way suicidal thoughts and behaviors spread in social networks is different for men and women. This could be because of gender-based expectations and stereotypes, such as men being expected to be more stoic and less likely to talk about their feelings, or women being expected to be more emotional and more likely to talk about their problems.

Alternatively, the study could also have found that the small world experiment does not show any significant difference in the way suicidal thoughts and behaviors spread among men and women, indicating that the social networks are not affected by gender stereotypes and expectations in this regard.

It is important to note that suicide is a complex issue that is influenced by a variety of factors such as mental health, social support, access to resources, and cultural beliefs. A small world experiment would be one of many research methods used to understand the issue and it would require further research to validate any findings.
