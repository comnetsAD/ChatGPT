The researchers would likely find that the letter takes the same amount of time to get to the female target as it does to the male target. 

In the past, before 2050, Milgram found that it took longer for the letter to reach the female target. Women were harder to reach because they were employed less, so they had fewer weak ties than men connecting them to public life and more distant networks. However, they had more strong local ties (to family, children). According to Durkheim, it was these strong ties that protected women against egoistic suicide because they are more embedded in tight social circles and less isolated.  

In 2050, women commit suicide just as much as men. Following Durkheim‚Äôs argument, their social networks probably now look the same: women are now too less deeply integrated in modern society and so have lost protection against suicide compared to men. This occurred because of increasing employment for women, which increased their weak ties compared to strong ties. With similar amounts of weak ties between women and men now, the small world experimenters would find that letters take the same time to reach a female versus male target.
