Durkheim showed that in 19th-century France, male suicide rates were higher than female suicide rates probably because women were excluded from the workforce. We can predict that if the female suicide rate increases is because women's workforce participation is increasing. Milgram‚Äôs Small World experiment showed that on average we are 6 people away from each other. Six is the average number of people needed to make a letter arrive from one stranger to another However, it took more people to make the letter reach the target if the person was a woman. We analyzed that this was probably because fewer women had jobs, but they had children, and thanks to them they had their local networks. In this scenario (2050) the suicide rate for both sexes is the same, so we could speculate that this is because the labor force participation for both sexes is the same. In the Small World Experiment, this would result in the number of people necessary to make the letter reach the target to be the same, no mattering the target‚Äôs sex, thanks to the fact that now women have the same networks as men since they have the same quantity of jobs.
