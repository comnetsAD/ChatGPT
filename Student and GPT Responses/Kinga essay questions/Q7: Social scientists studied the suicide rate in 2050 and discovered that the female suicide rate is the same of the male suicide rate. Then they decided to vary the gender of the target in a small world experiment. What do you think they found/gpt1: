It is impossible for me to say exactly what social scientists would find if they studied the suicide rate in 2050 and discovered that the female suicide rate is the same as the male suicide rate, and then varied the gender of the target in a small-world experiment.

However, it is worth noting that suicide rates can be influenced by a variety of factors, such as mental health, social support, access to resources, and cultural attitudes towards suicide. While a gender gap in suicide rates has traditionally existed, with men having higher rates than women, it is possible that changes in society, such as increased awareness of mental health and more support for women, could lead to a reduction in this gap in the future.

If the social scientists varied the gender of the target in a small world experiment, it could potentially reveal different patterns of social networks and dynamics that might contribute to suicide rates. However, it is important to note that Suicide is a complex phenomenon and it is influenced by multiple factors. Therefore, it is crucial to use multiple methods and approaches to study it.
