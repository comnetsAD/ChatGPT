I think they found that the results would be different, but the results would be a more accurate reflection of the true suicide rate; in other words, they would find a more accurate suicide rate for both genders. For example, if in the original study they took a sample of 100 people with 2 females and 98 males. If one of the females had committed suicide and 49 of the males had committed suicide, their respective gender suicide rates would both be 50%. However, that would not be an accurate representation of the population because the sample sizes for each group were not balanced. If the new gender targeted small world experiment were 50 females and 50 males, the gender ratio would be balanced. This would reflect a more accurate image of what could be expected in the population. Furthermore, if the gender ratio was unbalanced in the original study, a small world experiment with targeted genders could actually provide more variation within the gender samples. This would also allow for more varied and precise results.
