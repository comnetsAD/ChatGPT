It is impossible to know exactly what social scientists would find if they studied the suicide rate in 2050 and discovered that the female suicide rate is the same as the male suicide rate and then varied the gender of the target in a small world experiment. The results of the experiment would depend on a variety of factors such as the specific methods and measures used, the population being studied, and the overall societal and cultural context.

However, it is likely that the social scientists would find that gender plays a role in the spread of suicide-related behaviors through social networks. The small world experiment is a method used to study the spread of information and behaviors through social networks. By varying the gender of the target, the researchers would be able to examine whether there are differences in the spread of suicide-related behaviors between men and women.

It's important to note that suicide is a complex phenomenon that is influenced by a variety of factors such as mental health, social support, access to resources, and cultural attitudes towards suicide. Therefore, it is likely that the results of the experiment would be multifaceted and nuanced and would require further research to fully understand the underlying mechanisms.

In any case, any research that is done on the topic of suicide should be done with sensitivity, care and with the help of experts in the field, as the topic of suicide is a sensitive one and can be triggering to some people.
