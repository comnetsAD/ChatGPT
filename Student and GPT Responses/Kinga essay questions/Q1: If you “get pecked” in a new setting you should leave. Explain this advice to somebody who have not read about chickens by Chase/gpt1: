The phrase "get pecked" refers to a situation where an individual, or group of individuals, is being singled out and bullied by others. In the context of chickens, it means that one chicken is being targeted and attacked by other chickens in the flock.
The advice to "leave" in this situation means to remove oneself from the situation or environment where the bullying is occurring. This can be done by physically moving away from the aggressor(s) or by removing oneself from the group or setting altogether.
In the case of chickens, it would mean to separate the targeted chicken from the flock, provide a separate coop or pen for it to live in, and monitor its health and well-being.
The reasoning behind this advice is that being in a situation where one is consistently being bullied can have negative effects on an individual's physical and mental health. By removing oneself from the situation, the individual can avoid further harm and potentially find a more positive and supportive environment.
