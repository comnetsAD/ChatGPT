This advice is referencing a concept from the book "The Chicken Health Handbook" by Gail Damerow. The author states that if a new chicken is introduced to a flock and it gets pecked by the other chickens, it is best to remove the new chicken from the flock as it is likely to be bullied and may not be accepted into the group. The pecking may lead to injury or even death. It's best to avoid this scenario by properly introducing the new chicken to the flock, giving it a chance to establish its place in the group before it gets pecked. This is just a general rule of thumb and not a hard and fast rule as every situation is different.
