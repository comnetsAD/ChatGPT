Pecking is one of the actions performed by chickens to assert dominance along with other attack behavior (such as feather-pulling, scratching, or jumping on another chicken) according to the findings of the Chase research paper (1980) which explores the process of dominance hierarchy formation in small groups. When a chicken attacks another, it is asserting dominance and will ‚Äúsubsequently engage and dominate other individuals not yet dominated, but not individuals to which it is already subordinate;‚Äù(Chase, 919) as a Double Attack strategy. If the attacked chicken did not retaliate, then a transitive triad would form thereby fixing the attacked chicken as a loser and having a lower status than other chickens. Thus to leave if you get ‚Äúpecked‚Äù in a small group is a valid advice as ‚Äúthe predominant use of the Double Attack sequence‚Äù (Chase, 922) is observed as a result of this research. In the scope of human behavior, getting pecked could include being slandered or physically bullied. The next time you are in a new environment (such as a high school class or the university‚Äôs residential lodging living room area) beware of possible pecks and act against them by standing up for yourself and others.
