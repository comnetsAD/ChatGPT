Chase studied where and how hierarchy is formed. He conducts an experiment on chickens to find out how dominance is established, by character or by chance. Through the experiment he found that chickens prefer to be at the top of the pecking order and get there by chance rather than due to any special attributes such as strength or smartness.

And as with the chicken example, the hierarchy in that environment will be created by chance.  And so, if you start to get pecked in a new environment, you have several strategies: peck back or leave
