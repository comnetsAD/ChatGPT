This advice is referencing a concept from a book called "Chickens: Taming and Training" by Gail Damerow. The book is about raising chickens and includes advice on how to handle the birds in different situations. The phrase "get pecked" is used to describe when a chicken pecks at or attacks another chicken. In a new setting, such as a new coop or a new flock, chickens may be more likely to peck at each other as they establish a pecking order. The advice to leave if you "get pecked" means that if you see one chicken pecking at another, it's best to separate them immediately, because the pecking can escalate and cause injury to the birds.
It is an advice for the chickens' keeper to watch the interaction between the birds and intervene early if they see aggressive behavior, to prevent any serious harm to their birds.
