Chase, in his study, intends to answer the question: ‚Äúwhat are the behavioral processes leading to hierarchy formation?‚Äù He investigates the dynamics of said hierarchy formation, and his method uses chickens as subjects. Ultimately, he advises that if you ‚Äúget pecked‚Äù in a new setting you should leave. The study assumes that getting pecked results in the transference of a relationship between two chickens (transitivity). Several outcomes are possible; however, the most likely is a ‚Äúdouble attack‚Äù ‚Äî getting pecked may influence others to peck you too, (or worse ‚Äî everyone to attack you in what is known as a ‚Äúdouble recieve) making you a victim at the very bottom of the hierarchy. If you peck someone else in response, you become a perpetrator of violence as well as a victim to it. Therefore, your best case scenario is to leave the setting as a whole, escaping the violent pecking. This is especially important advice for those who are at a disadvantage due to discrimination against class, race or gender (thereby being more susceptible to being pecked).
