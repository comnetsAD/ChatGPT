Balance theory helps hypothesize the possible results that can occur from conflicts that happen between social relations within a network of people. In this case, a triad, there are four possible outcomes, however, only two are positive. In order to have a balanced outcome, they must be positive therefore discussing the positive outcomes is most beneficial.
The first outcome is that all relationships are positive. This can occur in two ways, either your two friends solve their issues alone prior to affecting the triad' balance or you help mediate the fight that occurs to ensure a positive triad once again. Another outcome is that there are two negative and one positive relationship. This can happen if you become closer to one of the two girls, which also means an enemy of a friend becomes an enemy.
To maintain a balanced triad, people should not change their relationship within the triad, and as a result conflict within the relationship can be avoided.
