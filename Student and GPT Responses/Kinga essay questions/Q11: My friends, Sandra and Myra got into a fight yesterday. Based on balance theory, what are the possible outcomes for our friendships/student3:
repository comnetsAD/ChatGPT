Balance theory is built on shared cultural rules and the assumption that relationships are symmetric in order to hypothesize the possible outcomes of conflict within a moderately small social network. In the case of your friendship, the possible outcomes are threefold. The first possible outcome would be that Sandra convinces you to stop being friends with Myra (or vice versa), thus creating a negative relationship between you and Myra (or Sandra) but still maintaining the balance of the triad (-.-.+=+). The second possible outcome is that you will convince Sandra to reconcile with Myra (or vice versa), thus re-establishing a positive relationship between the two that also leads to a balanced outcome (+.+.+=+). This would also be the case if they were to reconcile on their own without your involvement. Finally, the last possible outcome is that you will segregate your friendships between Sandra and Myra which would mean that you would have positive relationships with each but they will have negative relationships with each other. In this case, the triad would be imbalanced (+.+.-=-).
