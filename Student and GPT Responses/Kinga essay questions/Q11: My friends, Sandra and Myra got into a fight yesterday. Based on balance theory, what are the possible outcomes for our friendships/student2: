The fact that these three girls were originally all friends means that they were all nodes in a positive and balanced triad. Sandra and Myra now disliking each other means that the triad is no longer balanced as the edge between the speaker and Sandra is positive as is the edge between the speaker and Myra, whereas the edge between Sandra and Myra is now negative. If the two girls do not make up, there are three outcomes of this situation. The first of these is that the speaker sides with Sandra and develops a negative edge with Myra, thus balancing out the triad. The opposite possibility is also true, where the speaker sides with Myra, developing the negative edge with Sandra but also balancing out the triad. The last possible outcome is that the speaker loses her positive edges with both Sandra and Myra, causing the triad to splinter and their connections to be severed.
