Balance theory is a social psychological theory that explains how people strive to maintain balance in their social relationships. According to balance theory, relationships are balanced when the attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors of one person are consistent with those of another person. When there is a disagreement or conflict between two people, this balance is disrupted and the relationship is said to be imbalanced.

Based on balance theory, there are several possible outcomes for the friendship between Sandra, Myra and you following their fight:

Restoration of balance: Sandra and Myra may reconcile and restore balance to their relationship by resolving their conflict and returning to a state of consistency in their attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors.

Segregation: Sandra and Myra may choose to end their friendship and no longer interact with each other, resulting in segregation. This can happen when the relationship is considered too imbalanced, and it's not worth the effort to restore balance.

Triangulation: Sandra and Myra may seek support from other people, such as yourself or other friends, to restore balance to their relationship. This is known as triangulation and it can help to diffuse the tension and restore balance to the relationship.

Persistence of imbalance: Sandra and Myra may choose to persist in their conflict and continue to maintain an imbalanced relationship. This can happen when the relationship is considered important enough to persist despite the imbalance.

It's worth noting that balance theory is not the only explanation of social relationships, and the outcomes of any given conflict or disagreement can be affected by a wide range of factors including the personalities, the context, and other social dynamics.
