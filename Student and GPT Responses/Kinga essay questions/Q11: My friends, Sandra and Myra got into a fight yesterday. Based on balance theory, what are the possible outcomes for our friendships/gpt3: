Balance theory is a social psychological theory that proposes that people strive to maintain balance in their relationships, by aligning their attitudes and behaviors with those of their friends. According to balance theory, there are three possible outcomes for relationships following a fight or conflict: balance, imbalance, and dissolution.

Balance: If Sandra and Myra are able to resolve their conflict and maintain positive attitudes towards each other, the balance in their friendship will be restored. This means that their attitudes and behaviors will be consistent with each other, and their friendship will continue as normal.

Imbalance: If Sandra and Myra are unable to resolve their conflict, but continue to maintain their friendship, an imbalance may occur. In this case, one or both individuals may change their attitudes or behaviors to maintain the relationship, but the friendship will be marked by tension or discomfort.

Dissolution: If Sandra and Myra are unable to resolve their conflict and choose to end their friendship, the relationship will dissolve. This means that their attitudes and behaviors will be inconsistent with each other, and the friendship will come to an end.

It's important to note that balance theory is not the only explanation of relationships dynamics and many other factors such as the nature of the conflict, the communication skills of the individuals, the type of relationship, and the context in which the conflict takes place will also play a role in determining the outcome of the friendship.

In summary, Balance theory proposes that people strive to maintain balance in their relationships, the possible outcomes for a friendship after a fight or conflict are: balance, imbalance, and dissolution. Balance means that the friendship will continue as normal, Imbalance means that the friendship will be marked by tension or discomfort and dissolution means that the friendship will come to an end.
