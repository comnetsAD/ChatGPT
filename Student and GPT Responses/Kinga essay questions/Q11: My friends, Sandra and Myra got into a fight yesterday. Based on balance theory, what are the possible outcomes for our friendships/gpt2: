According to balance theory, the outcome of a conflict between two friends, such as Sandra and Myra, can depend on the nature of their other friendships and the balance of positive and negative relationships within the social network.

One possible outcome of the conflict is that the friendship between Sandra and Myra will end, and they will no longer associate with each other. This could happen if the negative feelings generated by the conflict outweigh the positive feelings that were present in the friendship.

Another possible outcome is that the friendship between Sandra and Myra will continue but in a weakened state, with less communication, less trust and less intimacy. This might happen if the conflict is not resolved and the negative feelings generated by it linger on.

A third possible outcome is that the friendship between Sandra and Myra will be strengthened by the conflict, as they work through their differences and come to a deeper understanding of each other. This could happen if the conflict is resolved and the positive feelings that were present in the friendship outweigh the negative feelings generated by the conflict.

A fourth possible outcome is that Sandra and Myra's friendship will not change much, that is, the friendship will continue as before, with no major changes in the level of intimacy, trust, or communication. This could happen if the conflict is not severe or if the friends are able to resolve it quickly.

It's important to note that the outcome of the conflict can also depend on the nature of other friendships within the social network, and whether the balance of positive and negative relationships is maintained or disrupted. For example, if Sandra and Myra have other close friends who support them, the negative effects of the conflict may be mitigated, and the friendship may be more likely to continue or even strengthen.
