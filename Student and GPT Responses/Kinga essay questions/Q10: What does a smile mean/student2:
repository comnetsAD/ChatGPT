Through the lense of sociology, a smile can have numerous meanings. My theory is that a nice smile has a lot to do with your social status. A nice smile alludes that you have the money to go to a dentist and whiten your teeth for example. So, people with good teeth would smile more because they would like to show that they belong to a higher strata and to differentiate themselves from those belonging to a lower strata. I could use existing literature on social structures and the importance of appearance to support my theory and I would also be able to test my theory to see if people with better teeth smile more to establish their position in society. In this way I will be able to at least falsify it.
