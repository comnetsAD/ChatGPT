	Every gesture in life has a meaning. This meaning is used to signal something. Signals are context-dependent. Smiling in situations signals happiness and in others signals shyness. It might also signal something about the smiler's type. Consider meeting a girl who' always smiling, that‚Äôd signal that she' a friendly, welcoming person. Although this might not be a strong signal from my perspective, the receiver, since it does not convey much information about who she', it still communicates something. Similarly, meeting another girl several times who rarely smiles, would signal that she' not friendly. It might also signal that she' not my type, if I perceive myself as friendly. Although a smile as a signal might not be a very strong one, if it' a part of a series of signals, it‚Äôd say more about the type of the person. This was the case with the Polish prisoners, who‚Äôve designed a series of tests that their results would determine the newcomer' type. For instance, rejecting certain offers suggests that the person is tough.(Kaminski 2003) However, taking this sub-test out of the series won‚Äôt say much about the newcomer, just like a smile doesn‚Äôt say much on its own.
