From a sociological perspective, smiling can reveal many implications. We can establish a theory that women smile more around men more than they would around other women to get the males attention. From a young age, women are taught that they should take care of their physical appearances to have more appeal towards men. Women who would have better smiles would be considered attractive. Lips and teeth play a great role as it is the focal point of the face. I would test my theory by finding literature relating to whether women actually smile more when surrounded by men. From there, I can test whether my theory would be true or false.
