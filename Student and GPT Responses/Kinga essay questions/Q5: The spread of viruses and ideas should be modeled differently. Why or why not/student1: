The spread of viruses and ideas should be modeled differently for many reasons. First, the spread of viruses is unidirectional, while the spread of ideas is bidirectional. If someone is infected with a disease and makes contact with a healthy person, the healthy person will get sick. However, the ill person doesn‚Äôt become cured when contacting a healthy person. On the other hand, if I bump someone with a different belief and try to convince him of my faith, there is almost an equal chance that one of us will influence the other. Second, if you are in a network, regardless of your position in a dense core or periphery, the probability that you affect everyone is high. However, suppose you put a person with a heterodox idea in the center and surround him with orthodox views. In that case, the probability of heterodox ideas spread is low because many individuals with vast knowledge constantly interact with the heterodox person. Nevertheless, radical ideas can nurture, gain strength, and spread faster if they start growing from the periphery.
