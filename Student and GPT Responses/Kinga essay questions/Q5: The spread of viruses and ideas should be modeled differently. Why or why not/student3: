Viruses and ideas share several things in common. Viruses are infectious agents that multiply rapidly in organisms. Similarly, ideas are shared and can be extremely widespread. Just like viruses are transmitted from person to person, people spread their ideas to other people. In fact, in day-to-day conversations we say that "X has gone viral," what' meant by that is that X became extremely widespread.  X' usually something that transmits an idea (i.e: video, post, etc). Liu and coauthors found that the autism epidemic in USA happened because mothers of autistic kids educated others about symptoms of autism and benefits of its treatment. Thus, rates of autistic children increased. It' the idea: a child might have autism, that socially diffuses across different social networks. For instance MotherA told MotherB, so MotherB told MotherC who lives in a different neighborhood about what autism is. Hence, the idea reached another neighborhood, which will spread to more neighborhoods. Similarly if MotherA had Covid-19 and met MotherB, so MotherB caught it, and then she met MotherC, so MotherC caught it. Consequently, the virus spread to another neighborhood, which won‚Äôt stop there and will spread to others. Consequently, viruses and ideas shouldn‚Äôt be modeled differently.
