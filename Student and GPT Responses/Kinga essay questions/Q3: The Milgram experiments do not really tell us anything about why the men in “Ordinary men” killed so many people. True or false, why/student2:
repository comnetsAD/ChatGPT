False, The Milgram paper (2004) explains why individuals obey authority even through morally questionable acts such as inflicting pain on others (or genocide in Browning book (2001)). In both the Browning and Milgram papers, the subjects were informed of the violent task at hand and asked for consent, both subjects had the opportunity to leave without penalty. The Milgram paper tells us about the Browning book through exploring the subject‚Äôs mentality in the way that sense of responsibility disappears (obedient subject/policeman attributes all responsibility to the experimenter/Captains who are considered as authority). An instance of resignation to authority is found in Major Trapp who ‚Äúsaid something like, 'Man, . . . such jobs don't suit me. But orders are orders.‚Äô‚Äù (Browning, Ch.7).  Milgram‚Äôs paper also explains why when the genocide was progressing slowly, the order to reposition police officers to shoot Jews again with the option of leaving without penalty, none of the officers chose to leave because according to the Milgram paper result: Moral concern shifts to living up to the expectations of the authority. The only limitation is that the Milgram paper doesn‚Äôt explore the influence of herd mentality on decision-making as opposed to the Police Battalion.
