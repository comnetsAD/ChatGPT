This statement is partly true and partly false. The Milgram experiments, which were conducted by Stanley Milgram in the 1960s, aimed to study obedience to authority by examining how people would respond to commands to deliver electric shocks to a "learner" (who was actually a confederate of the experimenter) in a laboratory setting. The Milgram experiments found that a significant proportion of participants were willing to deliver what they believed to be dangerous or even potentially lethal electric shocks to the "learner" when instructed to do so by an authority figure.

However, the Milgram experiments do not directly tell us anything about why the men in "Ordinary Men" (a book by Christopher R. Browning that examines the role of a unit of reserve police battalions in the Holocaust) killed so many people. The men in "Ordinary Men" were not involved in a laboratory experiment and were not being asked to deliver electric shocks to anyone. Instead, they were participating in the systematic murder of Jews and other minority groups as part of the Holocaust. The context, the setting and the motivation for the actions of these men were vastly different from the Milgram experiment.

That being said, the Milgram experiments do offer some insight into the psychological mechanisms that may have contributed to the actions of the men in "Ordinary Men." The experiments suggest that people may be willing to engage in actions that they would normally consider immoral or even criminal when they are instructed to do so by an authority figure. This could provide some insight into how the men in "Ordinary Men" were able to participate in the Holocaust despite the horrific nature of their actions. However, it is important to note that the Milgram experiments do not provide a complete explanation for the actions of the men in "Ordinary Men" and that other factors, such as social and historical context, also played a role.
