False. The Milgram experiments, which were conducted by Stanley Milgram in the 1960s, aimed to investigate obedience to authority and the willingness of participants to administer electric shocks to a confederate when instructed to do so by an authority figure. While the Milgram experiments were not specifically designed to investigate the actions of the men in "Ordinary Men" (a book by Christopher Browning that explores the actions of a unit of German reserve policemen during World War II), the results of the experiments can provide insight into the mechanisms of obedience and conformity that may have contributed to the actions of the men in the book. The Milgram experiments demonstrated that many participants were willing to administer what they believed to be dangerous levels of electric shock to a confederate when instructed to do so by an authority figure. This suggests that people can be inclined to obey authority figures, even when it goes against their own moral beliefs. Browning argues in his book that the men of Reserve Police Battalion 101 were not inherently evil, but they were willing to obey orders and commit atrocities because they saw it as their duty to obey authority. Therefore, while the Milgram experiments did not specifically investigate the actions of the men in "Ordinary Men," they do provide insight into the psychological mechanisms that can lead people to obey authority and commit acts that they would not normally consider. In summary, while Milgram experiments are not directly related to the "Ordinary Men" book, they do provide some insight into the psychological mechanisms of obedience and conformity that could have been a factor in the actions of the men in the book.
