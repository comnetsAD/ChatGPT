True. Milgram‚Äôs study on obedience and the impact of authoritative figures could relate to Browning‚Äôs ‚ÄúOrdinary Men‚Äù in a few ways. In Milgram‚Äôs experiment he concludes that humans are more likely to obey authoritative figures if they are isolated from groups and are not influenced by the people around them and that their obedience is based on the power projected by the authority‚Äôs role and was voluntary. Browning finds a similarity in terms of obedience being voluntary, where none of the men are forced to kill, they felt the need to do so with respect to solidarity with their peers. The difference is that in Browning‚Äôs case the men worked together and cooperated in the process of killing, which was done as an act of obedience to the authoritative figures. This denotes the difference, where in Milgram‚Äôs experiment individuals are isolated. However a similarity worth mentioning that Milgram stated that obeying authority results in banal behaviors which could explain how Browning‚Äôs men killed so many people, but does not properly justify why they did it.
