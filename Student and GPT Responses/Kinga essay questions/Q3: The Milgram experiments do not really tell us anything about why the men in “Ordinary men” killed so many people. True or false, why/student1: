This is true because Milgram experiments focused on the extent to which authoritative behavior influenced individuals to perform non-normative behaviors (actions that were against social norms). There were other elements that played into the obedience of authority as a function of group effects. Specifically, the likelihood to obey depends on factors such as hierarchy, compliance and explicit prescription of an action through orders. The effects of peer rebellion showed great undercut of someone‚Äôs authority. Thus, collectively people are unlikely to obey as long as there exists an identity that opposes the goal imposed by that authority. That is why Milgram‚Äôs paper does not tell us anything about why the men in Ordinary Men killed so many people. Browning explains something that Milgram‚Äôs paper does not, which is the dissolution of the status hierarchy of the killers as their participation increases in the killing machinery. More, other processes did not allow them to form identities around resistance against the system, such as constant reallocation, alienation from the possibility of establishing social ties, and the division of labor. They chose their area of work, while in Milgram‚Äôs experiment they were coercively forced to continue performing the same task through commands.
