The attitudinal fallacy is the belief that one's own personal feelings or attitudes towards a topic can be used as evidence for or against an argument or claim. In other words, it is the idea that because someone feels strongly about something, it must be true or false.

Jerolmack and Khan caution us against the attitudinal fallacy by emphasizing the importance of separating personal opinions or biases from objective evidence when evaluating an argument or claim. They argue that relying on personal feelings or attitudes can lead to flawed reasoning and a lack of critical thinking. Instead, they advocate for the use of evidence and logical reasoning to evaluate the merits of an argument or claim.
