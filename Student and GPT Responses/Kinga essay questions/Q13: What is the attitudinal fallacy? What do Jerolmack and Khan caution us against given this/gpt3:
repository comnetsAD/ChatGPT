The attitudinal fallacy is the belief that a speaker's attitude or feelings towards a topic can be inferred from the language they use to describe it. Jerolmack and Khan caution against assuming that a speaker's use of certain language or words necessarily reflects their personal beliefs or attitudes about the topic at hand, as language is often used in complex and nuanced ways that cannot be easily reduced to simple expressions of attitude or belief. Instead, they argue that we should focus on understanding the social and cultural contexts in which language is used, and pay attention to the ways in which language is used to achieve specific communicative goals.
