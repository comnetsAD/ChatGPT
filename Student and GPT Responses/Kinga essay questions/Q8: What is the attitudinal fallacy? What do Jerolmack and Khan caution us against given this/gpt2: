The attitudinal fallacy is a cognitive bias in which people assume that their own attitudes and beliefs are shared by others. It is the belief that the attitudes of others are directly observable and can be inferred from their behaviors or actions.

Jerolmack and Khan, in their article "The Attitudinal Fallacy and the Ethnography of Infrastructure" caution us against the attitudinal fallacy by warning that attitudes and beliefs are not directly observable, and that people's attitudes and beliefs are often shaped by the social and material environments in which they live. They argue that it is important to understand how people's attitudes and beliefs are formed, and how they are influenced by the social and material environments in which they live.

In the context of their article, Jerolmack and Khan caution us against assuming that people's attitudes towards infrastructure, such as roads or bridges, can be inferred from their use of these structures. They argue that people's attitudes towards infrastructure are shaped by a variety of factors, such as their social and economic background, their cultural context, and the infrastructure itself. Therefore, it is important to understand how these factors interact to shape people's attitudes towards infrastructure, rather than assuming that their attitudes can be inferred directly from their behavior.

In summary, the attitudinal fallacy is the belief that one can infer someone's attitude from their behavior or action. Jerolmack and Khan caution us against this by arguing that attitudes are complex, and shaped by a variety of factors such as social, economic and cultural context, and therefore can't be inferred directly from behavior.
