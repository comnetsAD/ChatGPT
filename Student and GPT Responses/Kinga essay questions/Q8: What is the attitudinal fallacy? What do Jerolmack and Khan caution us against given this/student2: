The attitudinal fallacy, as described by Jerolmack and Khan in ‚ÄúTalk is Cheap: Ethnography and the Attitudinal Fallacy,‚Äù describes the inconsistency between a person‚Äôs words and their actions. It is also referred to as the ABC (attitude-behavior consistency) problem. Many researchers make the mistake of overlooking the ABC problem by conflating self-reports with behavior and assuming a consistency between the two. Self-reports cannot be confused with behavior, since self-reports are overly individualistic and biased by personal experience. Jerolmack and Khan warn social researchers to beware of attitudinal fallacy, and to try to rely more on studying social interactions when possible. They propose ethnography, or observing direct actions, as a more accurate method for studying interactions and behaviors. While interviewing overlooks the attitudinal fallacy, ethnography can account for it.
