The attitudinal fallacy is a term used in the field of sociology to describe the tendency to infer people's attitudes or beliefs from their behavior or actions. It is the assumption that what people do is a reflection of what they believe or how they feel.

Jerolmack and Khan, in their paper "The Attitudinal Fallacy and the Study of Culture", caution sociologists against the attitudinal fallacy and argue that people's behavior is often not a good indicator of their underlying attitudes or beliefs. They argue that people's actions are shaped by a complex interplay of social norms, expectations, and constraints, and that these factors can influence behavior independently of people's attitudes or beliefs. Therefore, inferring people's attitudes or beliefs from their behavior can lead to a misunderstanding of the factors that shape their actions.

The authors suggest that sociologists should focus on understanding the social and cultural context in which behavior occurs, rather than inferring attitudes or beliefs from behavior. They also suggest that sociologists should be mindful of the complexity of social action and the many factors that can influence behavior, including social norms, expectations, and constraints.

In summary, the attitudinal fallacy is the assumption that people's behavior reflects their attitudes or beliefs, and Jerolmack and Khan caution sociologists against this assumption and encourage them to focus on understanding the social and cultural context in which behavior occurs.
