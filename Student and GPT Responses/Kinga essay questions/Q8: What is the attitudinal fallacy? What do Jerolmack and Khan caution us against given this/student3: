Jerolmack and Khan explain to us in their paper ‚Äútalk is cheap‚Äù that attitudinal fallacy is the error of inferring situated behavior from verbal accounts. For instance, self-reports of attitudes and behaviors are influenced by overly individualistic behavior and they might be detached from lived experience when responding to them. Thus, they fail into explaining what people actually do. Thus, even though attitudes related to everyday experiences seem to be easy to obtain via surveys, surveys might not be useful in understanding behavior. This is because the nature of self-reporting behavior will be subject to people‚Äôs vary depending on other factors such as, their levels of subconscious behavior or self-reflexivity. More, because as researchers there is not a provable way of controlling those variables or that inflicted bias by the participants. That is why, if we decide to use tools that quantify behavior we should be cautious when analyzing them and not take them at their face value. The authors‚Äô information is important as it makes us think more critically about the methodological challenges when conducting research. And more importantly, the importance of investigating the validity and reliability of our measurements.
