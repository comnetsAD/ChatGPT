The attitudinal fallacy is committed when verbal data are used to support claims not about what people believe or say, but what they do‚Äù (Jerolmack, Khan 200). There are three methods by which sociologists can attempt to understand human behavior: ‚Äú1) We can observe it in process; (2) we can view written or otherwise artifactual records of people; and (3) we can ask questions and listen to their answers‚Äù (179) Sociologists prefer a verbal approach, which is a "tendency to act," and they draw conclusions about people's behavior based on what they say. However, conclusions about people's behavior can only be drawn if their words are consistent with their actions. Because, more often than not, people just say things, but don't do them or act in ways that are ‚Äúinconsistent with their expressed attitudes‚Äù.
