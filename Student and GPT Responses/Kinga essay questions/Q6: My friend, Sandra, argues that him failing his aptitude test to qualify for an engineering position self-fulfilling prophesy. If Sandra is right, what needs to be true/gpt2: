If Sandra is right that failing the aptitude test was a self-fulfilling prophecy, several things would need to be true.

Sandra would have had negative expectations about his ability to perform well on the test before taking it. For example, he may have believed that he was not capable of understanding the material or that he would not be able to perform well under pressure.

These negative expectations would have affected Sandra's behavior or attitude in a way that hindered his performance on the test. For example, he may have felt anxious or unmotivated, which could have affected his concentration or ability to recall information.

The negative expectations and behavior would have resulted in Sandra failing the aptitude test.

The failure on the test would have reinforced Sandra's negative expectations about himself, creating a cycle of self-fulfilling prophecy.

It is important to mention that self-fulfilling prophecy is a complex phenomenon and there may be other factors that contributed to Sandra's poor performance on the test, such as lack of preparation, poor study habits, or difficulty with the specific material covered on the test. Additionally, this phenomenon can be broken by reframing the expectations and providing the right support to overcome the negative self-talk and enhance performance.
