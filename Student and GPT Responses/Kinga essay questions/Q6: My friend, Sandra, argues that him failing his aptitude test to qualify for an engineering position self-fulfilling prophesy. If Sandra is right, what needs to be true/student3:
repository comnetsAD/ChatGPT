Self-fulfilling prophecies are cases where people‚Äôs actions start off being informed by their false belief / perceptions of the world, and frequently connote an undesirable outcome. In most cases where negative outcomes are the result, these prophecies start with negative or irrational beliefs, ideas or expectations about oneself; frequently the product of upbringing or experiences with significant people. As such, Sandra‚Äôs argument is right if the following are true: to start, he must have had the preconceived notion that he was going to fail. Reasons for this may vary, but it could likely be low self-esteem, potentially as an impact of parental expectations or previous failures; ultimately leading him to believe that he would fail his aptitude test (the prophecy) This may have manifested into a lack of confidence in his ability, leading to his failure. The counterfactual condition to this is: had Sandra not believed he would fail due to his low self-esteem, would he have passed the test? If the counterfactual condition holds ‚Äî an absence of Sandra‚Äôs low self-esteem meant he would have passed (i.e., it‚Äôs presence is what led him to fail) ‚Äî then this is a self-fulfilling prophecy.
