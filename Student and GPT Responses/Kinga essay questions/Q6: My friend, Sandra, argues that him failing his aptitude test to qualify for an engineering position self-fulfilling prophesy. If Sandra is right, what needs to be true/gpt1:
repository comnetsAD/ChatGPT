If Sandra is correct in arguing that her failure on an aptitude test for an engineering position is a self-fulfilling prophecy, then several things would need to be true:

Sandra would have to have initially held low expectations of her own performance on the test.
Sandra's low expectations would have influenced her actions leading up to the test, such as not studying as much or not seeking help.
Sandra's low expectations and actions would have resulted in her not performing well on the test.
Sandra's poor performance on the test would then confirm her initial low expectations of herself.

A self-fulfilling prophecy is a belief or expectation that influences a person's behavior in such a way that it causes the belief or expectation to come true. In this case, Sandra's belief that she will fail the aptitude test would have led her to not prepare as much, which in turn would have led her to fail the test.

It is important to note that self-fulfilling prophecies can be cyclical, meaning that Sandra's failure on the aptitude test can lead to low expectations for future tests or similar situations, which in turn can lead to failure again. Furthermore, it is important to note that self-fulfilling prophecies are not predetermined or inevitable, they can be broken by changing one's mindset and behavior.
