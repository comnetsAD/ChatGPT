If Sandra is right, then she must have had the initial belief that she wasn‚Äôt qualified or ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù to be an engineer. Then with that idea in mind, Sandra took the aptitude test, and as a result of her belief that made her question her abilities and answers on the test, Sandra failed the test therefore fulfilling her self-fulfilling prophecy (SFP). SFPs are those processes where beliefs that are held by individuals are followed and have consequences that make the beliefs a reality and act as a confirmation to those beliefs from the eyes of the individual. Individuals in SFP fail to recognize that it is their belief that constructs the reality, since the reality that is constructed validates their belief, just like the SFP explored in teachers expectations of kindergarten students in the Rist paper (1970). Theoretically, the SFP steps include: 1)When X believes that Y is P, 2) X does b, 3) because of b, Y becomes P. In Sandra‚Äôs example, Sandra is X and Y,  P  is her perception of herself that she isn‚Äôt good enough to be an engineer. b (the action) is taking the test while she is doubting herself.
