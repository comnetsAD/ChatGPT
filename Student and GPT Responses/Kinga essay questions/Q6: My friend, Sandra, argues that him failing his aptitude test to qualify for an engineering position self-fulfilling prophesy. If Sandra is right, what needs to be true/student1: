The self-fulfilling prophecy is expectations about another person or entity that eventually result in the other person or entity acting in a way that regulates expectations. This is not related to predictions but related to behavior, more precisely related to a person's belief that the person's behavior will be affected. In general, women are still very underrepresented in areas where most people consider it a male job, such as technology, science, especially in engineering. The stereotype that is attached to gender, in this case, Sandra as a woman, is considered unqualified for a job position that is generally categorized as a male job. The personal ability of a woman who is often considered to be lower than that of men in terms of managerial, math, science, or in general STEM fields makes most women reluctant to go into these fields. As a result, there are fewer women, including Sandra, who are experts or have skill or ability in engineering.Furthermore, women will more likely to fail the aptitude test for an engineering position.
