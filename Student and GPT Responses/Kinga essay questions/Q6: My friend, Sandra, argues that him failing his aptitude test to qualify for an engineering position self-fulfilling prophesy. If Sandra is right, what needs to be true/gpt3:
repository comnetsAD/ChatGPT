If Sandra is right that failing the aptitude test is a self-fulfilling prophecy, then several things need to be true:

Sandra must have believed that he would fail the test before taking it. This belief could have been based on past experiences, expectations, or stereotypes.

Sandra's belief that he would fail the test must have affected his behavior or attitude towards the test. For example, he may have put in less effort in preparing for the test, or felt anxious or stressed during the test.

Sandra's behavior or attitude towards the test must have had an impact on his performance. For example, if he didn't prepare enough for the test, or was too anxious to focus on the questions, that might have affected his results.

The negative belief and behavior must have resulted in the failure of the test.

It's worth noting that self-fulfilling prophecies are not always negative and can also be positive, where a belief that one will succeed leads to actions and behaviors that lead to success.

It's also important to note that self-fulfilling prophecies are not the only reason for a failure. There can be many other factors that contributed to the failure of the test such as lack of knowledge, poor test-taking strategies or even just a bad day. It's important to identify the root cause of the failure and try to address it for future opportunities.
