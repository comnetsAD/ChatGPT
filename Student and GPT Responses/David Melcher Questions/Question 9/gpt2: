Schizophrenia is a major psychopathology that is characterized by symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, disordered thinking, and emotional flatness.

Symptoms:
Positive symptoms: These are symptoms that are present in addition to normal experience, such as hallucinations (hearing or seeing things that are not there), delusions (false beliefs), and disordered thinking, such as jumping from one topic to another.
Negative symptoms: These are symptoms that represent a loss of normal functioning, such as emotional flatness, lack of motivation, and social withdrawal.

Pharmacological treatments:
Antipsychotic medications are the most commonly used treatment for schizophrenia. These medications work by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain, which reduces the excessive dopamine activity thought to contribute to the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. The most common types of antipsychotic medications include typical antipsychotics (such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol) and atypical antipsychotics (such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine)

Specific neurotransmitters/hormones and receptor types:
Dopamine: It is a neurotransmitter which is thought to be involved in the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as hallucinations and delusions. Antipsychotic medications target dopamine receptors in the brain to reduce the excessive dopamine activity thought to contribute to these symptoms.
Glutamate: It is a neurotransmitter which is thought to be involved in the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as emotional flatness and lack of motivation. Recent research suggests that some atypical antipsychotic medications may work by targeting the glutamate system in the brain.

Heritability and/or genetics:
Schizophrenia is a complex disorder with multiple causes, and it is thought to be influenced by both genetic and environmental factors.
Twin studies have estimated the heritability of schizophrenia to be around 80%.
Recent research has identified several genes that may increase the risk of developing schizophrenia, such as the genes related to the dopamine and glutamate neurotransmitter systems.

Neuroimaging and other information about brain differences/mechanisms:
Structural brain imaging studies have found that individuals with schizophrenia have abnormal brain structure, such as smaller brain volume, and reduced gray matter in certain brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, the temporal lobes, and the hippocampus.
Functional neuroimaging studies have found that individuals with schizophrenia have abnormal brain activity in certain brain regions, such as the prefrontal cortex, the temporal lobes, and the hippocampus, which are involved in cognitive processes, such as attention, memory, and emotion.
Studies have also found that people with schizophrenia have abnormal connectivity between different brain regions, which may contribute to the symptoms of the disorder.

Overall, Schizophrenia is a complex disorder characterized by symptoms such as hallucinations, delusions, disordered thinking, and emotional flatness. It is thought to be influenced by genetic and environmental factors, and research has identified several genes that may increase the risk of developing the disorder. The primary treatment for schizophrenia is antipsychotic medication, which works by blocking dopamine receptors in the brain. Brain imaging studies have found that individuals with schizophrenia have abnormal brain structure and activity in certain brain regions, and abnormal connectivity between different brain regions, which may contribute to the symptoms of the disorder.
