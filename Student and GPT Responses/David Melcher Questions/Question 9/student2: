Schizophrenia (a) positive symptoms include delusions and hallucinations; negative symptoms include catatonic movements, apathy, and cognitive impairments like poor attention and poor memory (b) the increase in dopamine levels is shown to lead increase in positive symptoms therefore dopamine antagonists like typical antipsychotics that inhibit the reuptake of dopamine are used. Atypical antipsychotics are also used which also inhibits the reuptake of dopamine and other neurotransmitters like serotonin. (c) Schizophrenia is inheritable - twin studies have shown that if one of the twins, both fraternal and identical, is diagnosed as schizophrenic, then they have a higher chance of also being diagnosed as schizophrenic. (d) Neuroimaging studies have shown that schizophrenic patients have enlarged ventricles and gradual grey matter loss over the years. Neuroimaging studies and Ex-vivo studies have shown disorganized local networks in the hippocampus.
