Bipolar disorder a) symptoms: cycling between two extremes of emotions, either extremely manic or extremely depressed b) pharmacological treatments: lithium treatment is often used c) heritability: it is highly heritable. The response to lithium treatment is also heritable (i.e., if the parent responds well to lithium treatment, there's a good chance that the kid responds well as well. d) neuroimaging: the brain looks very different during manic period or depressed period, especially the limbic system. There's also enlargement of ventricles.
