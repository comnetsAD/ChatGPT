Depression: symptoms include low motivation, low concentration, pessimism, suicidal tendencies and memory issues. Pharmacology includes MOA’s that inhibit monooxidase from breaking down dopamine, serotonin and NE and SRI’s which block serotonin reuptake at the postsynaptic cleft. It is highly heritable with a large number of genes that can be triggered by environmental stressors (more likely to have it if parents do) and chromosomes (more prevalent in women). An fMRI would reveal higher activity in areas like the prefrontal cortex and amygdala and lower activity in areas like the hippocampus and related cortices.
