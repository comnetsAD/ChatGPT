Yes, distinct brain circuits do mediate different emotions. Certain brain regions are triggered when emotions are portrayed. For instance, when someone is angry there is usual activity in the pons, lateral cortex and amygdala. However, it should be noted that brain regions like the amygdala are active during a lot of emotions like anger, fear, disgust.
