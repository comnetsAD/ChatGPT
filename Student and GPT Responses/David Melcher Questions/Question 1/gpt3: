There is evidence from neuroimaging studies that different brain circuits are activated in response to different emotions. For example, the amygdala is strongly activated in response to fear and anxiety, while the ventral striatum is activated in response to positive emotions such as pleasure. Additionally, there is evidence that damage to specific brain regions can lead to specific emotional deficits, such as a loss of fear responses following damage to the amygdala. Furthermore, studies have found that different emotions are processed in different areas of the brain, such as fear being processed in the amygdala, while joy and happiness are processed in the ventral striatum. This supports the idea that distinct brain circuits mediate different emotions.
