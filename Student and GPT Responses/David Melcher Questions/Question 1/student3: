Certain brain regions and circuits seem to light up during fMRI studies when inducing certain emotions, for example, fear sees activation in the pons and orbitofrontal areas which are engaged in their own cycles. Disgust shows activation in the anterior insula and its related areas. As these areas show minimal to no engagement otherwise we assume that they are tied to their emotion to elicit specific and distinct neural effects and responses (for example the specific physiological response).
