There is evidence from both neuroimaging and lesion studies that suggests distinct brain circuits do mediate different emotions. For example, neuroimaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown that different regions of the brain are activated in response to different emotions. For example, the amygdala is activated in response to negative emotions such as fear and anger, while the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is activated in response to positive emotions such as happiness and contentment. Additionally, lesion studies, which involve studying individuals who have sustained damage to specific brain regions, have also provided evidence for distinct brain circuits mediating different emotions. For example, individuals with damage to the amygdala have been found to have difficulty experiencing fear and other negative emotions, while individuals with damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex have been found to have difficulty experiencing positive emotions.
