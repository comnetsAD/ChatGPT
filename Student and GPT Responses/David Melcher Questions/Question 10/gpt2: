I learned something about the brain during a group activity where we visited a lab that studies the neural basis of memory. The researchers in the lab use a combination of techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), and electrophysiology (EEG) to study how the brain processes information and forms memories.

One of the studies that we learned about during our lab visit focused on how the brain encodes and retrieves memories. The study used fMRI to measure neural activity in the brain while participants were presented with a list of words and asked to memorize them. Later, the participants were shown the list of words again and asked to retrieve the words they had previously memorized. The researchers found that different areas of the brain, including the hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex, and the parietal cortex, were activated during the encoding and retrieval of memories. This study is similar to the one conducted by (Eldridge, et al. 2005) in which they found that the hippocampus plays a key role in the encoding and retrieval of memories while the prefrontal and parietal cortices are also involved in the process.

This study provided insight into how the brain encodes and retrieves memories and how different brain regions may be involved in this process. The researchers also found that the activity in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex were strongly correlated, which suggested that these areas may work together to encode and retrieve memories. This is in line with the study conducted by (Squire and Wixted, 2011) where they found that the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex are strongly correlated in the encoding and retrieval of memories.

This study was interesting to me because it provided a glimpse into the neural processes that underlie memory and showed that it's a complex process that involves multiple brain regions. Additionally, the fact that the activity in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex were correlated suggested that these areas work together to encode and retrieve memories, which was a new insight for me.

In summary, I learned during a group activity in which we visited a lab that studies the neural basis of memory, that different areas of the brain, including the hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex, and the parietal cortex, were activated during the encoding and retrieval of memories. This is similar to the study conducted by (Eldridge, et al. 2005). Additionally, the researchers also found that the activity in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex were strongly correlated, which suggested that these areas may work together to encode and retrieve memories. This is in line with the study conducted by (Squire and Wixted, 2011).
