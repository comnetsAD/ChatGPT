Throughout this semester we delved into how we can use specific regions in the brain to localizefunctions, discuss neural pathways or understand why certain disorders exist. This viewing the brain asalmost a sum of its moving parts was physically demonstrated in our visit to the MRI lab during one ofour recitation sessions. The demonstrations were highly valuable in my understanding of the localizationof function as we saw how moving a specific part of the body corresponded to a specific cortex, however,what caught my attention the most was our discussion on how the MRI can be combined with 3-Dmodeling in cancer research.Firstly the demonstration of how specific areas lit up in Brunasâ€™ brain when she did certainactions, and the labs use of 3-D models in cancer patients taught me about specialization, the need forprecision here was largely about preserving function with our specific discussion being about the savingof the motor cortex post brain tumor removal. In general we discussed that while the brain in general hasa degree of generalization and redundancy, there are specific areas where localization of function is muchmore present, here the motor cortex is one where damage can lead to the loss of function in certain limbsand other areas cannot take over its functions fully to the same level of efficiency. Economo et al (2018) discusses how specialized this region of the brain is, and demonstrates that even when interconnectedwith other areas, like the thalamus, it remains the sheer executor of function, hence the motor corticesmust fulfill several functions, for example it has the ability to both predict and coordinate movement.Furthermore, when discussing the injury and the recovery of the cortex ideas of plasticity often arise, thelab visit taught me that while there is some hope of one motor cortex taking the others function, and whilethere is some degree of plasticity, the ability to recover seems to be largely limited in the motor cortex. Some researchers believe that motor plasticity is mostly related to the development of new skills, and theidea of repair and recovery are much more complex in this area and must be targeted with specialtreatment post injury (Nudo et al., 2001).Additionally, our discussion of the further intersection between MRI studies and cancer led us totalk about further combining this technology with 3-D printing to create models to help surgeons prepbefore surgery. This idea of intersecting technology with our knowledge of the brain was intriguing to meas it was the first time that I heard about it. This idea is one that is developed and some researchers haveeven found that having the model before hand can decrease surgery planning time by two thirds andrecommend it as standard procedure (Singhal et al., 2015). Other research did find that these results maybe limited in other areas of the body with different types of cancer (Ritacco et al., 2013). Regardless,these applications get me to think about how much technology allows for intersectionality, specificallyabout the involvement of the psychology community with other fields and about how the barriers betweenfields often blur. This here demonstrated the development of brain technology and treatments.In conclusion, our lab visit taught me about how there are no direct answers when it comes tounderstanding the brain, there often are ideas that only apply to specific regions. The visit also got methinking about technological development and community outreach when it comes to the brain, and itdemonstrated the process of the development of treatments and methods when it comes to the brain.Overall, this hands on and collaborative experience was helpful in both getting us to learn and interact with faculty.
