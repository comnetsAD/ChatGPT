I learned something about the brain during a group activity where we visited a lab that studies the neural basis of decision making. The researchers in the lab use a combination of techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrophysiology (EEG) to study how the brain processes information and makes decisions.

One of the studies that we learned about during our lab visit focused on how the brain represents value in decision making. The study used fMRI to measure neural activity in the brain while participants were presented with different options and asked to make a choice. The researchers found that different areas of the brain, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the striatum, were activated when participants were presented with different options and that the level of activation in these areas was related to the perceived value of the options. This study is similar to the one conducted by (Kable and Glimcher, 2007) in which they found that the vmPFC and the striatum play a key role in representing the value of different options during decision making.

This study provided insight into how the brain represents value in decision making and how different brain regions may be involved in this process. The researchers also found that the activity in the vmPFC and the striatum were strongly correlated, which suggested that these areas may work together to represent value in decision making. This is in line with the study conducted by (Roesch and Olson, 2004) where they found that the vmPFC and the striatum are strongly correlated in representing the value of different options during decision making.

This study was interesting to me because it provided a glimpse into the neural processes that underlie decision making and showed that it's a complex process that involves multiple brain regions. Additionally, the fact that the activity in the vmPFC and the striatum were correlated suggested that these areas work together to represent value, which was a new insight for me.

In summary, I learned during a group activity in which we visited a lab that studies the neural basis of decision making, that different areas of the brain, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the striatum, were activated when participants were presented with different options and that the level of activation in these areas was related to the perceived value of the options. This is similar to the study conducted by (Kable and Glimcher, 2007). Additionally, the researchers also found that the activity in the vmPFC and the striatum were strongly correlated, which suggested that these areas may work together to represent value in decision making. This is in line with the study conducted by (Roesch and Olson, 2004).
