One of the in-person activities that were conducted which I found intriguing was seeing the audio and visual pathways of the brain through the VR glasses. It was an interesting experience to be able to see the different structures in the brain and indeed did help in visualizingthe concepts I had learned in class. One of the structures I was relatively unfamiliar with its specific before participating in this activity was the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Through the activity and the lessons taught in class, I have learned that the LGN is located in the dorsal posterolateral thalamus and is responsible for normal visual processing – it receives information from the retina and directs it to the visual cortex. It also regulates the density and concentration of visual information flowing to the visual cortex (Skalicky, S.E., 2016). Further research into this structure has revealed the LGN’s involvement in visual attentionand conscious perception (Wurtz, R. H. et al., 2011; O’Connor, D. H. et al., 2002). In terms of visual processing, each of the LGN neurons innervates the retinal ganglion cells in the optic nerve to establish the concentric center-surround receptive fields and also sends its axons to the visual cortex through optic radiations (Zabbah, S. et al.,2014). The LGN consists of six layers and each layer is distinctly different from the others – layers 2, 3, and 5 receive ipsilateral inputs from the retinal ganglion cells, and layers 1, 4, and 6 receive contralateral inputs from the retinal ganglion cells. There is also a difference in the types of neurons in each layer – layers 1 and 2 have magnocellular neurons, layers 3 to 6 consist of parvocellular neurons, and koniocellular neurons exist in between these layers (Covington, B. P. & Al Khalili, Y., 2022). The magnocellular layers have large receptive fields, are highly sensitive to movement, and process light/dark information from the rod cells. The other 4 layers are more attuned to fine details, color, and slow movements. A study conducted by Jones, H. E et al. (2015) looked into figure-ground segregation, which is the visual system’s ability to differentiate between the background and objects of interest, in the LGN by studying the macaque’s saccade response to a stimulus. The stimulus wasa full screen of luminance dots – the figure was colored differently and moved in the opposite direction compared to the background dots. The green and blue arrows on the screen indicate the direction that the background and the figure are moving. They concluded that the spike activity that was seen in neurons was explained by the feed-forward connections from the retina to the LGN and to the visual cortex, and the feedback from the visual cortex to the specific layers in theLGN (Jones, H. E et al., 2015). While studying the LGN, I was curious why the layers of the LGN are in a specific order and why each layer was made up of these specific neurons. There wasn’t enough research available that outlines a theoretical explanation for this. It would be interesting to ponder how they would conduct a study or propose an explanation for this.
