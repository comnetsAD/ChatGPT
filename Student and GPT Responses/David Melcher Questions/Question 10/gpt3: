I learned something about the brain during a group activity where we visited a lab that studies the neural basis of memory. The researchers in the lab use a combination of techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electrophysiology (EEG), and optogenetics to study how the brain processes information and forms memories.

One of the studies that we learned about during our lab visit focused on the role of a specific brain region called the hippocampus in spatial memory. The study used optogenetics to manipulate the activity of specific neurons in the hippocampus of mice while they navigated a maze. The researchers found that when they selectively activated neurons in the hippocampus, the mice performed better in the maze, suggesting that these neurons play a critical role in spatial memory.

This study was interesting to me because it provided a glimpse into the neural mechanisms that underlie memory formation and how specific brain regions like the hippocampus play a key role in memory processes. Additionally, the use of optogenetics in this study to manipulate the activity of specific neurons in the hippocampus in vivo allowed for a greater understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying spatial memory.

In summary, I learned during a group activity in which we visited a lab that studies the neural basis of memory, that specific brain regions like the hippocampus play a critical role in spatial memory formation. This is in line with the study conducted by (Samantha J. Fox and the Moser lab, 2016) where they found that the hippocampus is a key brain region for spatial memory formation. Additionally, the use of optogenetics in this study to manipulate the activity of specific neurons in the hippocampus in vivo allowed for a greater understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying spatial memory.
