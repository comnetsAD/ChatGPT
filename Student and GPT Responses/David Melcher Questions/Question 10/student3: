One of the biggest obstacles to studying psychology, or biology, is the lack of a clear visual stimulus for them to visualize the structure and understand what is going on inside the unseen. In one of the classes, we were able to use VR technologies to help us immerse ourselves in the 3-D demonstration of the visual pathway. One of the most interesting structures to me is the optic chiasm. It is the midpoint of the visual pathways where what is perceived in the left visual field get to go to the right side of the brain and vice versa, which is a difficult process to imagine and a bit counterintuitive. However, it seems clearer when we actually act as if we are the visual stimulus and going through the journey of the brain. Afterseeing the visual pathway, I am also wondering what could happen if the optic chiasm isn't functioning properly. In search of the literature, I discovered a rare case known as chiasmahypoplasia, in which visual cortex plasticity is challenged to accommodate three hemifieldmaps. (Ahmadi et al, 2020) One condition is known as achiasma, which is caused by the loss of crossing nasal fibers, one eye would receive two inputs from both ipsilateral and contralateral hemifields. Another, which is called chiasma hypoplasia, is led by the predominance of non-crossing nasal fibers. However, instead of one eye receiving no input,chiasma hypoplasia patients receive three inputs, one from the ipsilateral hemifield and the other from both hemifields. (Ahmadi et al, 2020) However, using high resolution fMRI at 7T,DWI and fMRI-based pRF mapping at 3T, the asymmetrical crossing of the nasal fibers of the two eyes that results in three overlaid representations of opposing hemifields on the left visual cortex was identified. This suggests that the scope of cortical plasticity in the human visual system is sufficient to accommodate input from three visual hemifields, which is very surprising to me. (Ahmadi et al, 2020)What also intrigues me as an enthusiast for education is the incorporation of VR in teaching.A survey investigating the experience of VR teaching in high school STEM subjects reveals that VR facilitates teaching because, for example, it can enable the performance of dangerous experiments in a safe way (Holly et al, 2021), which might be an advantage for psychology courses as well because many experiments are quite difficult to replicate or present in an undergraduate class setting.
