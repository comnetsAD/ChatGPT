One example of a disorder of attention is Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD).

Symptoms of ADHD include difficulty paying attention or maintaining attention for an extended period of time, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Individuals with ADHD may have trouble completing tasks, following through on instructions, and may be easily distracted. They may also have difficulty sitting still and may be prone to interrupting others or acting impulsively without thinking.

The exact brain mechanisms involved in ADHD are not fully understood, but research suggests that several brain regions and neural systems may be affected. Imaging studies have shown that individuals with ADHD have reduced activity in the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in attentional control and decision making, as well as in the parietal cortex, which is involved in orienting attention and spatial processing. Additionally, there is evidence of abnormal functioning of the dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmitter systems, which are involved in regulating attention and motivation.

Additionally, there is a strong genetic component to ADHD, with multiple genes having been linked to the disorder, including genes involved in the regulation of dopamine and norepinephrine signaling, and genes involved in the development of the brain regions known to be involved in attentional control.

Overall, ADHD is a disorder of attention characterized by symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, with involvement of different neural systems and brain regions.
