Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.

Symptoms of inattention include difficulty with focus, organization, and completing tasks; forgetfulness, and disorganization. Symptoms of hyperactivity include fidgeting, restlessness, and difficulty staying still. Symptoms of impulsivity include acting without thinking, interrupting others, and having a hard time waiting one's turn.

ADHD is thought to be caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, and is associated with dysfunction in several brain regions and neural networks. These include the prefrontal cortex, which is thought to play a role in attentional control and impulse regulation, the basal ganglia, which is thought to be involved in the regulation of motor activity, and the cerebellum, which is thought to be involved in motor coordination.

Imaging studies have also shown that there are abnormalities in the functional connectivity and activity of the dopamine and norepinephrine systems in individuals with ADHD. These systems play a crucial role in the regulation of attention, motivation, and reward processing.

Overall, ADHD is a disorder of attention characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, and is thought to be caused by dysfunction in several brain regions and neural networks, including the prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, as well as the dopamine and norepinephrine systems.
