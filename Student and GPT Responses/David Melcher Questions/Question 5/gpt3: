Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a disorder of attention characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.

Symptoms of inattention include difficulty paying attention to details, trouble with organization, avoiding tasks that require sustained mental effort, losing things, being easily distracted, and forgetfulness. Symptoms of hyperactivity include fidgeting, difficulty remaining seated, excessive talking, and interrupting others. Symptoms of impulsivity include acting without thinking, impatience, and interrupting others.

The exact brain mechanisms involved in ADHD are not fully understood, but research suggests that it may involve dysfunction in the neural networks that control attention and impulse control. These networks include the prefrontal cortex, which is involved in executive functions such as attention, working memory, and impulse control, as well as the striatum, which is involved in reward processing and impulse control. Dysfunction in these networks may result in an impaired ability to filter out distractions, maintain focus, and inhibit impulses, leading to symptoms of inattention and impulsivity.

Additionally, studies have found that individuals with ADHD have abnormal brain activity in areas associated with attention and impulse control, such as the frontostriatal circuit, which is a network that connects the prefrontal cortex and the striatum.

Some studies have also suggested that there may be a genetic component to ADHD, and that it may be associated with abnormal dopamine regulation in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that plays a critical role in attention, motivation and reward. Therefore, abnormal dopamine regulation may lead to difficulties in attention and impulse control.

Overall, ADHD is a disorder of attention characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, and it is thought to involve dysfunction in the neural networks that control attention and impulse control and abnormal dopamine regulation.
