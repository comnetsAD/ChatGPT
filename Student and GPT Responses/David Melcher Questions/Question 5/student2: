ADHD, also known as attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder, is characterized by the inability to concentrate or pay attention to stimuli for long periods of time. Symptoms might include fidgeting and the inability to sit still for a period of time. A possible explanation is the low levels of dopamine produced in the cortico-hippocampal-axis which is linked to attention. Stimulants that increase the production of dopamine and other neurotransmitters like serotonin may help with decreasing these symptoms.
