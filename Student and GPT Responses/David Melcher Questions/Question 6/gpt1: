Voluntary attention, also known as endogenous attention, is the ability to actively direct attention towards a specific stimulus or task. It involves the deliberate, conscious control of attention and is often used when an individual is trying to focus on a specific task or when there is a need to filter out distracting information.

Reflexive attention, also known as exogenous attention, is the automatic capture of attention by a salient or unexpected stimulus. It does not involve conscious control and is often triggered by environmental cues such as loud noises, bright lights, or sudden movements. It is a more passive process than voluntary attention, and it is thought to be an adaptive response that allows the individual to quickly respond to potential threats in the environment.

Similarities:
Both voluntary and reflexive attention involve the allocation of cognitive resources to specific stimuli or tasks.
Both types of attention can be influenced by the individual's goals and expectations, and can affect their perception of the world.

Differences:
Voluntary attention is an active, conscious process, while reflexive attention is automatic and passive.
Voluntary attention is directed towards specific goals and tasks, while reflexive attention is triggered by salient or unexpected stimuli.
Voluntary attention involves the deliberate control of cognitive resources, while reflexive attention is triggered by environmental cues.

In summary, voluntary attention is the ability to actively direct attention towards a specific stimulus or task, and is often used when an individual is trying to focus on a specific task. Reflexive attention is the automatic capture of attention by a salient or unexpected stimulus, and it does not involve conscious control. Both types of attention involve the allocation of cognitive resources to specific stimuli or tasks but have different mechanisms of control and are triggered by different types of stimuli.
