They both require selective attention where one focuses on a single stimulus at a time, they use similar sensory systems, e.g. eyes, both involve other cognitive processes, both mostly use parietal network. Also both use spatial cueing tests. Top down voluntary attention is one where we select a stimulus, it takes more time to activate but last much longer, it uses the dorsal frontoparietal system, FEF and IPS. Bottom-up or reflexive are fast reactions to exciting or sudden stimulus, but we do not choose. It lasts for much less and it uses tempoparietal systems to control. If exciting enough it can become top-down.
