Similarity: they both boost performances in detection tasks. Either instructed to pay attention to the left side of the screen or use exogenous stimulus to manipulate the attention, participants will perform better when the target stimulus is actually appearing on the left side of the screen than on the right side of the screen. Difference: Voluntary attention is controllable by individual. They can decide when to pay attention, pay attention to what and when not to pay attention. However, reflexive attention is involuntary, meaning that one has no control over having or not having the attention. The sudden appearance of a stimulus on the screen will grab the participant's attention regardless of one's own will.
