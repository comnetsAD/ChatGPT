Voluntary attention, also known as top-bottom processing, is related to the internal, conscious effort taken to determine whether the incoming information of stimulus is worth paying attention to. Reflexive attention, also known as bottom-up processing, is determined when external events or stimuli catch our attention before any conscious effort is taken to determine whether it is worth paying attention to. Voluntary attention activates the dorsal-frontoparietal-system which includes the IPS and the frontal eye field. Reflexive attention activates the right tempoparietal system which includes the tempoparietal junction.
