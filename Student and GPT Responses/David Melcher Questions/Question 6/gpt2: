Voluntary (endogenous) attention and reflexive (exogenous) attention are both types of attention, but they differ in how they are triggered and how they operate.

Similarities:
Both voluntary and reflexive attention involve the ability to selectively focus on certain stimuli while ignoring others.
Both types of attention are thought to involve the activity of the same brain regions, including the parietal cortex and the prefrontal cortex.
Both types of attention can operate simultaneously and can influence each other.

Differences:
Voluntary attention is triggered by our own goals, intentions, and internal states. It is under our conscious control, and we can direct it towards different aspects of the environment. It is also known as "top-down" attention, as it is driven by the brain's higher cognitive processes.
Reflexive attention is triggered by sudden, unexpected, or salient stimuli in the environment. It is an automatic response that occurs without our conscious control, and it captures our attention regardless of our goals or intentions. It is also known as "bottom-up" attention, as it is driven by the brain's lower-level sensory processes.
Voluntary attention is more flexible and can be sustained for longer periods than reflexive attention.
Voluntary attention can be directed to internal states such as thoughts, memories or emotions, reflexive attention is only directed to external stimuli.

In summary, voluntary and reflexive attention are two types of attention that differ in how they are triggered and how they operate. Voluntary attention is triggered by our own goals and intentions, it is under our conscious control, and it is more flexible and can be sustained for longer periods. Reflexive attention is triggered by sudden, unexpected, or salient stimuli in the environment, it is an automatic response that occurs without conscious control, and it captures our attention regardless of our goals or intentions. Both types of attention involve the ability to selectively focus on certain stimuli while ignoring others, and they are thought to involve the activity of the same brain regions, but they can operate simultaneously and can influence each other.
