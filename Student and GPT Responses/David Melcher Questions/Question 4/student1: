At synapse level, NMDA receptor is inactivate at the beginning because of the presence of magnesium (MG+2). Memorization will lead to the polarization of neurons, emitting nuerontransmitters. These NTs will bind with AMDA receptors and excites NMDA by driving the MG out. Calcium will be able to enter through NMDA and depolarize the post-synaptic neuron. This will create more AMDA at the pre-synaptic neuron so that the next time, the response will be faster.
