At the single-neuron level, learning can lead to more synaptic connections being created, rearrangement of synapses, and increased receptors. While learning a new skill, new neuron endings may be formed therefore new synaptic connections are made. Or more neuron endings are formed to an existing synaptic connection. another way is when learning a new skill releases more neurotransmitters like dopamine then more dopamine-specific receptors will be formed in the terminal endings so next time the connection can be made. Another way is the rearrangement of the neurons into new patterns leads to faster transmission and recollection of new skills learned in the long term
