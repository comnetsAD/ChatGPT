Learning and memory involve changes in the strength of synapses, which are the connections between neurons. There are several mechanisms by which synapses can change during learning and memory, including:

Long-term potentiation (LTP): This is a process by which the strength of a synapse is increased, making it more likely that an action potential will be generated in the postsynaptic neuron. LTP is thought to be a mechanism for memory formation. It is mediated by an increase in the number of receptors, particularly NMDA receptors, at the synapse.
Long-term depression (LTD): This is the opposite of LTP, in which the strength of a synapse is decreased. LTD is thought to play a role in learning by selectively weakening synapses that are not being used. It is mediated by a decrease in the number of receptors, particularly AMPA receptors, at the synapse.
Synaptic scaling: This is a process by which the strength of all synapses on a neuron are adjusted to maintain a balance of excitation and inhibition. It is mediated by the activity of the receptors of the neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA
Synaptogenesis: This is the formation of new synapses. This process occurs primarily during the development of the nervous system but also occurs during learning and memory formation.

These are examples of how synapses can change during learning and memory, and each one of these mechanisms involve different receptors and neurotransmitters in the process. LTP and LTD, for example, involve the NMDA and AMPA receptors, respectively. Synaptogenesis, on the other hand, involves the activity of growth factors and neurotrophic factors that promote the formation of new synapses.
