Learning and memory involve changes in the strength of synapses, the connections between neurons. These changes in synaptic strength are thought to underlie the formation and storage of memories.

One example of how synapses can change during learning is through Long-Term Potentiation (LTP). LTP is a process by which the strength of a synapse increases as a result of repeated or prolonged activation. This occurs when there is an increase in the number of receptors at the postsynaptic membrane, such as NMDA receptors, which are activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate. The activation of NMDA receptors leads to a cascade of events that ultimately result in the strengthening of the synapse.

Another example of how synapses can change during learning is through Long-Term Depression (LTD). LTD is a process by which the strength of a synapse decreases as a result of prolonged or repeated inhibition. This occurs when there is a decrease in the number of receptors at the postsynaptic membrane, such as AMPA receptors, which are also activated by the neurotransmitter glutamate. The inhibition of AMPA receptors leads to a cascade of events that ultimately result in the weakening of the synapse.

In summary, learning and memory involve changes in the strength of synapses, these changes can happen through Long-term Potentiation (LTP) and Long-term Depression (LTD) . LTP increases the strength of synapses by increasing the number of receptors at the postsynaptic membrane, such as NMDA receptors, and LTD decreases the strength of synapses by decreasing the number of receptors at the postsynaptic membrane, such as AMPA receptors.
