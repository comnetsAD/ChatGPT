Learning and memory involve changes in synapses, the connections between neurons. These changes can occur through several mechanisms, including changes in the strength of synapses and the formation of new synapses.

One example of how synapses can change during learning is through a process called long-term potentiation (LTP). LTP is a persistent increase in synaptic strength that occurs in response to repeated neural activity. It is thought to underlie many forms of learning and memory. LTP is thought to occur through a variety of mechanisms, including the insertion of new AMPA receptors, a type of receptor that allows for the influx of calcium ions into the neuron, into the postsynaptic membrane. This increase in AMPA receptors allows for an increase in the excitability of the postsynaptic neuron, leading to increased synaptic strength.

Another example of how synapses can change during learning is through a process called synaptic scaling. Synaptic scaling is a process by which the strength of all synapses on a neuron are adjusted to maintain a constant overall level of excitation. This process can occur in response to changes in neural activity, such as changes in the number of neurons that a neuron is connected to. This process is thought to help maintain the stability of neural networks, preventing runaway excitation and allowing for more precise control of neural activity.

In summary, synapses can change during learning and memory through various mechanisms, including long-term potentiation and synaptic scaling. LTP is a persistent increase in synaptic strength that occurs in response to repeated neural activity and is thought to underlie many forms of learning and memory.
