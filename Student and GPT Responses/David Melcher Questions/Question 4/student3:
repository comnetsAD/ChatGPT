Hebbian theory tells us that the pre and post synapses can change with more learning, for example with more neurotransmitters in the cleft or increased post-synaptic surface area. What happens within this membrane is glutamine resulting in AMPA channels activating and through a process result in mg 2+ ions from unbinding with another receptor, NMDA, allowing for calcium to enter and depolarize the membrane. This has a retrograde effect releasing substances that prompt increased NT release from the pre-synapse.
