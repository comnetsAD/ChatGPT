From the prevalence of psychiatric disorders, it can be guessed that there is a complex interplay of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors that contribute to the development of these disorders. These disorders are likely influenced by the interaction of multiple genes and environmental factors, including stress, trauma, and life experiences. Additionally, some disorders may have different underlying neural mechanisms, which can affect their prevalence and presentation.
