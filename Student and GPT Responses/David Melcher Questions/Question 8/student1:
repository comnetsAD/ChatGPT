Schizephrenia is the most prevalent psychiatric disorders. It is more common in urban areas than rural areas. This might be that rural area residents have less access to medical resources so they don't get examined often or that people living in ruban areas suffer more stress so that they get higher chances of having schizephrenia. It might also be the problem of heritability, where fewer people living in rural areas have the family history of schizephrenia.
