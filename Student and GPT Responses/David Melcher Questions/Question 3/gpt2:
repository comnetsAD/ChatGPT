Attention modulates sensory processing by selectively enhancing the processing of relevant stimuli and suppressing the processing of irrelevant stimuli. This happens through a number of neural mechanisms.

One mechanism is through the modulation of neural gain, which refers to the amplitude of neural responses. Attention can increase the gain of neurons that respond to relevant stimuli, leading to a stronger neural signal and thus a greater ability to detect and process that stimulus.

Another mechanism is through the selective recruitment of neural populations, in which attention can bias the brain to recruit neurons that are more responsive to relevant stimuli. This can occur through the modulation of neural synchronization, in which attention can increase the synchrony of neural activity among neurons that respond to relevant stimuli.

Additionally, attention also modulates sensory processing by altering the flow of information through the brain. Attention can increase the flow of information from sensory areas to higher-level cognitive areas, allowing for more efficient processing of relevant stimuli.

Finally, attentional modulation of sensory processing also happens through the suppression of the processing of irrelevant stimuli. This can occur through the inhibition of neural populations that respond to irrelevant stimuli, or through the modulation of the flow of information from irrelevant stimuli to higher-level cognitive areas.

Overall, attention modulates sensory processing through a complex and dynamic set of neural mechanisms that work together to selectively enhance the processing of relevant stimuli and suppress the processing of irrelevant stimuli.
