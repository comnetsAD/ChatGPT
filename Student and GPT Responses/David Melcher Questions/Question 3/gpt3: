Attention modulates sensory processing by selectively increasing the gain of neural activity in specific neural pathways, while decreasing the gain in others. This allows an individual to selectively process certain aspects of the environment while disregarding others.

One potential neural mechanism for this is through the modulation of neural activity in the primary sensory cortices, such as the visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices. When an individual focuses their attention on a specific stimulus, neural activity in the corresponding primary sensory cortex increases, while activity in other primary sensory cortices decreases. This is thought to be mediated by the influence of attentional control networks, such as the parietal and prefrontal cortices, on the primary sensory cortices.

Additionally, attention modulates neural activity in higher-level cognitive areas such as the inferior temporal, and the ventral premotor cortices. These areas are thought to be involved in the selection of relevant information from the primary sensory cortices and preparing appropriate motor response.

The control of selective attention is also thought to involve the interplay between different neural systems, such as the dorsal and ventral attention networks, and their interactions with the primary sensory and higher-level cognitive areas. The dorsal attention network, which is associated with the parietal cortex, is thought to be involved in the control of voluntary attention, while the ventral attention network, associated with the temporal cortex, is thought to be involved in the control of attention to emotionally salient stimuli.

Overall, attention modulates sensory processing by selectively increasing neural activity in specific pathways, and decreasing it in others, through the interactions between different neural systems and brain regions.
