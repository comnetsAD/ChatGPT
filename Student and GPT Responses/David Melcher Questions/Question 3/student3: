Bottleneck filtration can help our brain choose how to process sensory information. In early selection we choose which stimulus to attend to at early sensory processing stages, meaning the thalamus. If stimulus is distinct here it continues if not it is filtered out. Eg having 2 distinct voices that you choose one. Late selection is when information passes the thalamus to higher cortical regions where it is filtered there, e.g. prefrontal cortex higher under cognitive processing happens here. For example, hearing someone call your name even if you were already paying attention to another auditory stimulus.
