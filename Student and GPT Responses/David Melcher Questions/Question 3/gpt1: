Attention modulates sensory processing by selectively enhancing the neural processing of certain stimuli while suppressing the processing of others. This is thought to occur through a number of neural mechanisms.

One mechanism by which attention modulates sensory processing is through the modulation of neural activity in early sensory cortices. Attention has been shown to increase the firing rate of neurons in primary visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices, which enhances the neural representation of attended stimuli.

Another mechanism by which attention modulates sensory processing is through the modulation of neural connectivity between early sensory cortices and higher-level cognitive regions, such as the prefrontal cortex. Attention has been shown to increase the functional connectivity between these regions, which allows for more efficient processing of attended stimuli.

Additionally, attention modulates sensory processing through the release of neuromodulators such as dopamine and acetylcholine, which can change the gain of neural circuits and alter the excitability of neurons in sensory areas, thus modulating the salience of the stimuli.

In summary, attention modulates sensory processing through a combination of neural mechanisms, including increased neural activity in early sensory cortices, increased functional connectivity between early sensory cortices and higher-level cognitive regions, and the release of neuromodulators that change the gain of neural circuits and alter the excitability of neurons in sensory areas.
