There are 3 different types of sensory processing: early processing, late processing, and multiple-level processing. In early processing, the incoming sensory information enters the sensory organs and goes through initial processing and perception. After this, the thalamus decides whether the incoming information is worth paying attention to or not before it goes through higher analysis. In late processing, the sensory information has gone through initial processing, perception, and basic cognitions before the decision is made on whether the stimuli are worth paying attention to or not. In multiple-level processing, attention can modulate any stage of sensory processing - the lower the level or stage the lesser the cost.
