At single neuron level, a specific neuron will fire more when attended stimuli are found than unattended stimuli so attention will augment the firing rate of the neuron. Using EEG, we can find that the attended stimuli will elicit more amplitude in the ERPs, specifically at N1 and P1. Using fMRI, we would find that brain regions will be more active when seeing attended stimuli. All these suggest that attention will boost neuronal activities and increases performances.
