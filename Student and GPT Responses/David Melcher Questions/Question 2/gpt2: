Stress is a state of physical, mental or emotional strain or tension that results from adverse or demanding circumstances. The main distinction between two types of stress described in class is acute stress and chronic stress. Acute stress is short-term stress that is caused by immediate demands or threats, such as a car accident or a job interview. Chronic stress is long-term stress that occurs over a prolonged period of time, such as ongoing work-related stress or a difficult relationship.

The anatomy and function of BI-DIRECTIONALITY of communication between the nervous system and the immune system at rest and in the face of stress is that the nervous system and the immune system communicate through a complex network of signaling pathways. At rest, this communication is relatively balanced, with the nervous system sending signals to the immune system to promote a state of homeostasis, or balance. In the face of stress, however, the balance is disrupted, with the nervous system releasing stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline that can suppress the immune system. On the other hand, the immune system can communicate back to the nervous system through the release of inflammatory molecules that can activate the sympathetic nervous system and further exacerbate the stress response.

This bidirectional communication between the nervous and immune system is important for maintaining the body's overall health and well-being, but when stress response is chronic, it can have negative effects on physical and mental health, leading to various diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and depression.
