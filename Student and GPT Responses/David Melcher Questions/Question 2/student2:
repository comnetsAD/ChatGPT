Stress is a physiological and psychological response to triggering situations or situations which require an individual to process a high cognitive load of information. Social stress in particular is felt from the pressures found in social contexts. Two forms of social stress are pro-social anger, which is when you feel anger for someone else who was being wronged, and pro-social distress, which is when you can feel someone else's pain. Stress is felt when the sympathetic system is activated. The hippocampus sends signals to the adrenal gland to release norepinephrine. The hippocampus also stimulates the anterior pituitary gland which then stimulates the adrenal cortex to release cortisol. These two neurotransmitters then produce physiological changes like rising heart rate, increased sweat production, and decreased growth, digestion, and suppression of the immune system. The suppression of the immune system is related to suppressed production of antibodies which leaves the body vulnerable and at risk of developing infections. At a resting state, the neurotransmitters slowly dissipate or broken down as the parasympathetic system clams the body down which allows the production of antibodies to begin necessary repairs.
