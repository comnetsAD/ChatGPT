Stress is a set of psychological and physiological responses against an exciting event. Anatomical structres of nervous system and the immune system includes sympathetic and parasympathetic nerves, adrenal gland, pituatary gland, etc. In face of stress, the sympathetic nerves will send signals to the endocrines systems to release hormones including epinephrine and steroids including cortisol, to prepare the body for the fight-or-flight response. At rest, parasympathetic nerves will regulate the body back to homeostasis state. If the body is stressful for too long a period, the immune system will be fatigue and weaker.
