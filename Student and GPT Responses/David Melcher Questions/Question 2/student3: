Fast response stress: signal from hypothalamus uses neurotransmitters, acts faster, uses adrenal cortex, activates sympathetic and parasympathetic responses; Slow response: hypothalamus triggers anterior pituitary gland, uses adrenal hormones like cortisol, involve other processes like memory. At rest both systems share body energy and work at full capacity in healthy individuals. When stressed neural directs resources away from immune response as body is in danger and certain NTâ€™s attack, NE suppresses production of antibodies. Immune systems in turn change brain activity. So in turn they both hinder each others full function under stress.
