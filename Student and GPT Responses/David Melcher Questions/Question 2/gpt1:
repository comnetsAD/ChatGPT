Stress is the body's response to any demand or threat. It can be physical, such as injury or illness, or psychological, such as work or relationship problems.

The main distinction between two types of stress is acute stress and chronic stress. Acute stress is the normal, short-term response to a specific demand or threat. It can be beneficial as it helps us to react quickly to danger. Chronic stress, on the other hand, is long-term stress that can have negative effects on our physical and mental health.

The anatomy and function of the bidirectional communication between the nervous system and the immune system at rest and in the face of stress is complex. At rest, the immune system and nervous system communicate to maintain homeostasis, or balance, in the body. When stress occurs, the nervous system activates the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. This leads to the release of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline, which in turn can suppress the immune system. Conversely, the immune system can also communicate with the nervous system by releasing immune-modulating molecules that can influence the activity of the HPA axis and the sympathetic nervous system, influencing the stress response.

In summary, stress can be a normal and healthy response to certain situations but chronic stress can lead to negative effects on the body. The immune system and nervous system communicate bidirectionally and this communication is important for maintaining balance in the body, but stress can disrupt this balance.
