In biopsychology, consciousness refers to the subjective experience of the self and the external world, including perceptions, thoughts, emotions, and intentions. It is the awareness of one's surroundings, oneself, and one's own mental states.

Studying the "neural correlates" of consciousness refers to the examination of the specific brain activity and neural processes that are associated with conscious experience. This can include identifying the specific brain regions and neural circuits that are active during different conscious states and exploring how these neural processes give rise to the subjective experience of consciousness.

Consciousness can be studied experimentally through various methods such as neuroimaging, neuropsychology, and electrophysiology. These methods allow researchers to examine the neural activity and brain regions associated with different conscious states, such as perception, attention, and memory.

An example of a study on the brain mechanisms involved in consciousness is the use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to investigate the neural correlates of visual consciousness. This study might involve presenting participants with visual stimuli, such as images or patterns, while measuring their brain activity using fMRI. Researchers could then compare the brain activity of participants who are aware of the visual stimuli with those who are not, in order to identify the specific brain regions and neural circuits associated with visual consciousness.

A study by Tsuchiya and Koch published in 2006, used a similar approach to investigate the neural correlates of visual consciousness. They used an fMRI to measure the brain activity of participants as they viewed a rapid stream of images, and found that a specific brain region called the primary visual cortex (V1) was more active when participants reported being aware of the images. This study provides evidence for the role of V1 in visual consciousness and it also demonstrates that fMRI can be used to study the neural correlates of consciousness.
