Consciousness is the awareness of the existence of ourselves that can usually be tested with a mirror task in human (when one sees the stain on the mirror as if the stain is on the face, if one goes on to try wiping it off the face, then the one has consciousness). Studying the neural correlates of consciousness is trying to understand the neural basis of consciousness. One example is the workspace model. It shows that our consciousness is not stored or related to only one part of the brain but actually across the brain.
