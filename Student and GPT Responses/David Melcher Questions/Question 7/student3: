Consciousness refers to the total environmental and internal information that your brain has access to and the decision making mechanisms used to function and can involve other process like attention which interact with it. Neural correlates are the minimal systems and theories related to the spread of consciousness and the loops/cycles involved in it. For example, they include the global workspace model, feedforward, recurrent and IIT models. A mechanism involved is sensory selection. An experiment here is binary competition where different stimulus is shown to each eye, one exciting and one not. Your conscious experience is seeing or perceiving the exciting one, but if asked later one may subconsciously be drawn to the boring stimulus suggesting that unconsciousness also plays a role.
