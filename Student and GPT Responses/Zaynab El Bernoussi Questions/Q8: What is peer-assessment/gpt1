Peer-assessment is a method of evaluating student's work or performance by having their peers provide feedback and evaluation. This can be done through formal or informal methods, such as through written evaluations, rubrics, or verbal feedback. Peer-assessment can be used in a variety of settings, such as in the classroom, in group projects, or in online learning environments.
Peer-assessment can have a number of benefits, including:
Encouraging active learning and engagement
Providing students with an opportunity to give and receive feedback
Allowing students to evaluate the work of their peers in a more objective and reliable way than teacher only assessment
Helping students to develop critical thinking and evaluation skills
Offering an alternative perspective on student's work
Giving students a sense of ownership and responsibility for their own learning
However, it is important to note that peer-assessment should be used as a complementary tool to teacher assessment, and it should be well-designed, well-implemented and well-supervised to ensure that the evaluations are fair and accurate. Additionally, it's important to provide students with the appropriate training and guidance on how to conduct peer-assessments in an effective and respectful manner.
