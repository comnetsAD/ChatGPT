Peer assessment is a process in which individuals evaluate and provide feedback on the work of their peers. This can include evaluating the work of classmates, colleagues, or other individuals within a group or organization. Peer assessment can be used in a variety of settings, such as in education, where students may be asked to evaluate the work of their classmates, or in the workplace, where employees may be asked to provide feedback on the work of their colleagues.

Peer assessment can be done in different forms, such as self-assessment, where individuals evaluate their own work, or direct assessment, where individuals evaluate the work of others. It can also be done through different methods, such as written evaluations, verbal feedback, or numerical ratings.

The main objective of peer-assessment is to provide feedback that can help improve the quality of work, by providing constructive feedback and helping individuals to identify their strengths and areas for improvement. Additionally, it can also be used to promote collaboration, accountability, and mutual understanding among peers, and help individuals develop a sense of ownership and responsibility for their work.
