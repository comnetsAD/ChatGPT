Peer assessment can be a fair method of evaluation for university courses if it is properly implemented and structured. There are several factors that can contribute to the fairness of peer assessment:
Training: Peers should be trained on how to provide constructive and useful feedback, and how to evaluate work fairly and objectively.
Guidelines: Clear guidelines and criteria should be provided to students on what they will be evaluated on and how their work will be assessed by their peers.
Anonymity: Anonymous peer assessment can help to reduce bias and ensure fairness by removing the influence of personal relationships and other non-academic factors.
Teacher's involvement: The teacher should be involved in the process to ensure that the feedback provided is accurate and fair. The teacher can also provide support and guidance to the students throughout the process.
Self-assessment: Self-assessment is another way to ensure fairness, as students can reflect on their own work before it is assessed by their peers, and identify any areas that need improvement.
However, it is important to note that peer assessment is not the only method of evaluation for university courses, and it should be used in combination with other methods, such as exams, quizzes, and assignments, to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of student learning. Additionally, it is important to consider the potential limitations of peer assessment, such as the possibility of bias, lack of expertise, and inconsistent feedback.
