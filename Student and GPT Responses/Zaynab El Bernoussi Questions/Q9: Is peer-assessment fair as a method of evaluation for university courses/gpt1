Peer assessment can be a fair method of evaluation for university courses, but it depends on how it is implemented. When done well, peer assessment can provide valuable feedback for students and can help them to gain a deeper understanding of the material. However, there are certain factors that need to be considered to ensure fairness.

One potential issue with peer assessment is that students may not have the expertise or experience to accurately evaluate the work of their peers. Therefore, it is important to train students on how to provide constructive and meaningful feedback. Additionally, the teacher should be involved in the process by providing guidance, monitoring, and moderating the assessments.

Another potential issue with peer assessment is bias. Peer assessment can be affected by personal biases such as friendship, enmity, popularity, etc. Therefore, it is important to ensure that the process is anonymous, or to use a double-blind evaluation process, where the assessor and the assessed do not know each other's identity.

Finally, it is important to consider the weight of the peer assessment in the final grade. Peer assessment should not be the only method of evaluation, and it should not be given too much weight in the final grade. It should be combined with other forms of evaluation such as teacher's assessment, self-assessment, or exams to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of student's learning.

In summary, peer assessment can be a fair method of evaluation for university courses, but it depends on how it is implemented. It should be done in a structured and guided way, with the teacher's involvement, and should be combined with other forms of evaluation.
