The peer assessment was eye-opening, as it gives a clear overview of the ways in which the summary could be addressed. Additionally, the arguments the others use for the “cause”, incentivized me further examine these causes from the table. Overall, an educational and helpful experience. It was fair, as the requirements were followed, and checked off.
