In many ways, it could be argued that our current economic system is based on the principle that everything has a price. This is because our economy operates on the principle of supply and demand, where goods and services are exchanged for money. This is the way most of the goods and services are provided in the market. However, there are certain things that are not given a price and are not meant to be exchanged for money, such as love, friendship, and other forms of social interaction, for example. Also, some goods and services are considered public goods, such as education and healthcare, that are not exchangeable for money, but rather are provided by the government as a right for citizens. The concept of "priceless" things exists in our world, but they are not always considered in the economic context.
