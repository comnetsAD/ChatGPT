It could be argued that in a capitalist society, many things are given a monetary value, and that access to goods and services is often dependent on one's ability to pay for them. However, it is not accurate to say that everything has a price. There are some things that are considered priceless, such as human life, freedom, justice, and so on. Additionally, many people and organizations, such as non-profit, volunteer, and charitable groups, work to provide goods and services that might not have a price tag, such as education, health care, and support for the less fortunate. There are also some activities, such as art and culture, which are considered priceless and are not subject to commercialization. So, while the concept of everything having a price is present in some aspects of our society, it is not entirely accurate to say that everything has a price.
