Bioethical issues are those that involve the application of ethical principles to the field of biology and medicine. Some examples of bioethical issues include:
Genetic engineering and genetic testing: The ability to manipulate and test for genetic traits raises ethical questions about the implications of this technology for individuals, families, and society as a whole.
Stem cell research: The use of embryonic stem cells in research raises ethical questions about the moral status of the embryo and the potential for the research to lead to the creation of human clones.
Cloning: The ability to create genetically identical copies of organisms raises ethical questions about the implications of this technology for reproduction and the definition of human identity.
Euthanasia and assisted suicide: The deliberate ending of a person's life raises ethical questions about the sanctity of life and the right to die with dignity.
Human experimentation: The use of human subjects in research raises ethical questions about the rights and welfare of research participants and the potential for abuse.
These issues are considered to be bioethical issues because they involve the application of ethical principles to the field of biology and medicine, and they raise questions about the responsibilities of scientists, healthcare professionals, and society as a whole in the use of new technologies and the protection of human life and welfare.
