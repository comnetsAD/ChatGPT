One example of a historical era of disorder is the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD. There were a number of reasons for the failure of the Western Roman Empire to adapt to changing conditions.

Firstly, the empire was plagued by invasions and attacks from barbarian tribes. These tribes were able to breach the empire's borders and cause significant damage to its infrastructure and population. The empire's army, which had been previously successful in repelling invasions, was overstretched and unable to defend all its borders effectively.

Secondly, the empire's economy was also in crisis. The empire's currency was debased and inflation was rampant, which led to a decline in trade and commerce. Additionally, the empire's tax structure was unable to support the cost of defending its territory and maintaining its infrastructure, which further contributed to the economic crisis. The combination of these factors led to a decline in the empire's ability to maintain order, which ultimately led to its collapse.

In summary, the collapse of the Western Roman Empire was due to a combination of external invasions and internal economic and political factors that the empire was unable to adapt to and overcome.
