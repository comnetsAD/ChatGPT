One example of (dis)order that the author presents is the Economic Earthquake; in that sense he particularly speaks of the 2008 financial crisis that struck the world. The author explains that the "speed and interaction of today's international economic relations necessitates an operational approach". Such an approach requires coordination between states and international institutions. However, the world failed to recognize that such a change is necessary and continued to operate through the traditional "single-center administrative paradigm" which fueled the economic earthquake the author speaks of.  The second failure of adaption that aided in the economic earthquake in this case is the interdependent nature of the global economy. This interdependence has allowed the financial crisis to spread from the US to the rest of the world at an exponential rate. Rather than allowing a global economy to serve as a growth booster that influences different economies to adopt positive approaches, states failed to properly adapt to the economic changes with new operational approaches which put them at risk of being affected by the downfall of any other economy in the world.
