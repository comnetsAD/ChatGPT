One example of disorder presented in the readings was the 9/11 attacks on the US. America, a nation which was secure in a feeling of being 'untouchable' was crushed by the wave of insecurity and fear that came from the 9/11 attacks. These attacks, which targeted New York, the financial hub of the nation fundamentally changed the state of mind of not only American citizens, but also of the American government. Following 9/11, the nation's defense strategy evolved, and a pre-emptive war against Afghanistan and Iraq began.
