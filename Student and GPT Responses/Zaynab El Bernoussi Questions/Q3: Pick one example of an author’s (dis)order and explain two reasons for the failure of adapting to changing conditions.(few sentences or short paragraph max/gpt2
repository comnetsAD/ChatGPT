One example of a historical era of disorder is the collapse of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD. There were a number of reasons for the failure of the Western Roman Empire to adapt to changing conditions.

Firstly, the empire was plagued by invasions by barbarian tribes such as Visigoths, Huns, and Vandals. These tribes, who were often better equipped and organized than the Roman army, were able to penetrate the empire's borders and weaken its military power. Additionally, the empire's economy was based on slavery, and slave revolts and a shortage of slave labor further weakened the empire.

Secondly, the empire was also plagued by internal issues such as political instability, economic problems, and a lack of strong leadership. These issues made it difficult for the empire to adapt to changing conditions and to effectively defend itself against external threats. The empire was also suffering from over-expansion, which led to financial and administrative strain, as well as from a decline in moral and civic virtues among the citizens and the military.

The Western Roman Empire's failure to adapt to changing conditions ultimately led to its collapse and the fall of the Western Roman Empire.
