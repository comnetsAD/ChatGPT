To establish new orders in Europe, committees like NATO, the EU, the UN, the OSCE, and the Council of Europe must cooperate. Their cooperation will support the economy to grow and offer security operations. These committees lean towards a structural (dis)order as their goal includes having a political capacity, allowing trade for the economy, and offering an extractive capability of the state, which consists of military power. Furthermore, the EU was able to reinstate countries in Europe by supporting expansions through structural changes. NATO has failed to take on a beneficial role in addressing current issues since the aid of security that they offer has hindered the process of having a geopolitical polis. Above all, NATO and EU are "limitedâ€¦to establish an order along an EU axis". That was evident during the Ukrainian crisis, as they were unsuccessful in cooperating and working together to establish orders. The EU and the NATO economic and political connection have been sapped as their discoordination results in (dis)orders which continue till today.
