One example of a historical era of order is the Pax Romana, which was a period of relative peace and stability in the Roman Empire that lasted from 27 BCE to 180 CE. The Pax Romana was primarily supported by the Roman military, which was one of the most powerful and well-organized in the world at the time. The Roman army was able to maintain control over the empire's vast territories and quell rebellions and invasions, allowing for relative peace and stability. Additionally, the Roman legal system, which was based on the rule of law and provided a sense of justice and order, also contributed to the Pax Romana. The Roman government also implemented a policy of religious tolerance, which helped to create a sense of unity and order among the diverse population of the empire.
