One historical era presented in chapter 1 of the reading is modern world order. This term describes an order that developed economically, philosophically, and politically as compared to the traditional world order. The modern world order's foundation lies in all three of the dimensions mentioned previously. The introduction of dynamic mercantilism set the foundation for economic development. Wars and their consequences set the foundation for political development as they promoted the introduction of treaties, congresses, and international institutions. Lastly, some foundations that enhanced and promoted the order were the development of nation-state and sovereignty concepts as induced by the treaty of Westphalia.
