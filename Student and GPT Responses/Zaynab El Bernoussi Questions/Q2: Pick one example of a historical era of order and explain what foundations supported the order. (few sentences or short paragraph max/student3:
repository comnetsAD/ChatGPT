Empires sought to be "a center of world orders" by connecting civilizations, and the Islamic civilization had a peak at conducting that. The Islamic civilization led a traditional world order which supported a central authority that created "a trans-territorial sphere of security and domination," which also allowed the control of trade routes and supported civilizations' legacies. Despite that, the intellectual and philosophical foundations have hindered the initiation and establishment of orders. The order of the Islamic Civilization could be a "global order" as it allows for the "interaction and engagement of the local and universal in the economic, political and cultural spheres." To have the civilization survive, the economy should grow, build urbanization in a center that upholds culture, implement a political order that empowers the connection of civilizations, and support the "advancement of knowledge and arts." The Ottoman Empire was a part of the Islamic civilization with leaders who connected ancient orders by using "titles that symbolized the leaders of ancient orders." Furthermore, the empire reigned for over 600 years by allowing the economy and politics to be flexible and adaptable.
