One example of a historical era of order is the Pax Romana, which was a period of relative peace and stability throughout the Roman Empire that lasted from 27 BC to 180 AD. The foundations that supported this order were a strong central government, a well-trained and organized military, and a system of laws and institutions that allowed for the efficient administration of the empire. Additionally, the Pax Romana was supported by the establishment of a common culture and language, and the development of infrastructure such as roads and communication systems that facilitated trade and the movement of people and goods throughout the empire. The Pax Romana also relied on the Roman Republic and Roman Empire's ability to conquer and control territories, and to maintain a system of governance and administration in those territories, which provided for the Pax Romana to be maintained.
