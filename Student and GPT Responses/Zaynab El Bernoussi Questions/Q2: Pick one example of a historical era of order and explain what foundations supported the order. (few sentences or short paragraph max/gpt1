One example of a historical era of order is the Pax Romana, which lasted from 27 BC to 180 AD. The Pax Romana, which means "Roman peace," was a period of relative peace and stability that was established throughout the Roman Empire. The foundations that supported the order during this time were a combination of military strength, political stability, and efficient administration. The Roman army was able to maintain control and quell rebellions, while the Roman government was able to establish a stable and centralized administration. Additionally, the Roman legal system helped to maintain order by providing a consistent set of laws and a system of justice. The Pax Romana was also supported by the construction of roads, aqueducts, and other infrastructure, which facilitated communication and trade throughout the empire.
