Proper indentation and code formatting: Using consistent indentation and code formatting makes the code more readable and easier to understand. This can be achieved by following a specific coding style guide, such as the Google C++ Style Guide. This guide provides recommendations on indentation, naming conventions, and other code formatting best practices. By following a consistent style guide, the code will be more organized and easier to navigate.
Use of comments: Comments are an important tool for making code more organized and readable. Comments can be used to explain the purpose of a block of code, provide information about how a specific function works, or describe the inputs and outputs of a particular algorithm. Comments can also be used to explain any assumptions that have been made when writing the code, or to provide information about any known bugs or limitations. Comments should be kept up-to-date and clear, and should be used sparingly.
Use of functions and classes: Breaking down your code into smaller functions and classes can help to make it more organized and easier to read. This can be achieved by grouping related functionality together into a single function or class, and by keeping functions and classes short and focused. This will help to make the code more modular and easier to understand, and will also make it more reusable.
Use of descriptive variable names: Using descriptive variable names makes it easier to understand the code, and can help to make it more organized. Descriptive variable names should clearly and accurately describe the data or information that the variable is holding. Avoid using short, generic variable names like 'x' or 'y' as they don't provide any information about the data or information the variable is holding.
