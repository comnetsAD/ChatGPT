Consistent indentation and naming conventions: One way to make your C++ code neat and organized is to use consistent indentation and naming conventions throughout your code. For example, you could use a consistent number of spaces for indentation, and use camelCase or snake_case for variable and function names. This makes your code more readable and easy to follow. Additionally, you could use meaningful names for variables, functions, and other elements in your code. This would make it more clear and readable.
Use of functions and classes: Another way to make your C++ code neat and organized is to use functions and classes effectively. By breaking your code down into smaller, modular pieces, you can make it more manageable and easier to understand. Functions can be used to group related code together, and classes can be used to organize and encapsulate data and functionality. This can improve the readability and maintainability of your code. Additionally, you could use commenting to explain the purpose of each function, class and variable which will make it easy for others to understand the code.
