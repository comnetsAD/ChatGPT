The source of the error in this code snippet is the factorial function.
The factorial function uses recursion, it calls itself with the argument x-1, and this continues until the base case is reached, where the function returns 1.
However, in this case when the function is called with an argument of 0, the function will keep calling itself in an infinite recursion, never reaching the base case, causing a segmentation fault error.
This is because the base case in this function is defined as x == 1, so the function will not return when x == 0.
To fix this issue, the base case should be changed to x == 0 or x == 1, depending on the desired behavior of the function.
