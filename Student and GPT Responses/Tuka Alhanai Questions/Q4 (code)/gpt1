The output of the following code snippet: 'a' < 'f' ? true : false; is "true"

This is because the comparison operator '<' compares the ASCII values of the characters 'a' and 'f' and 'a' has a lower ASCII value than 'f', so the comparison evaluates to true. The ternary operator ?: is then used to assign the value of true or false to the output depending on the result of the comparison.
Since the comparison is true, the value assigned to the output is true.
