#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class Drink {
  public:

  int volume;

  // constructor
  Drink(int v) {
    // variable private to the function
    volume = v;
    cout << "Volume: " << volume << "\n";
  }
};

int main() {
  // creating object
  Drink mydrink(12);

  // Create object with dynamic memory allocation
  Drink* mydrink2 = new Drink(15);

  return 0;
}

To create an object using dynamic memory allocation, you can use the keyword new followed by the constructor of the class. The new keyword returns a pointer to a newly created object in the heap memory. In this case, I've created an object of the class Drink called mydrink2 and set its volume to 15.
Additionally, I've fixed the quotation marks in the cout statement
Please note that since the object is created dynamically, it should be deleted using the delete keyword when it's no longer needed, to avoid memory leaks.
