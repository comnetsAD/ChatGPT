Improved readability and maintainability: Being neat and organized when programming makes it easier for others (or even for yourself in the future) to read and understand your code. Consistently using indentation, commenting and meaningful variable names, for example, can help others quickly understand the logic and the structure of your code. This makes it easier to identify bugs, make changes, and build upon the existing codebase. This in turn can increase the maintainability of the codebase and make it more efficient for future development.
Increased efficiency: Being neat and organized when programming can also increase your own efficiency as a programmer. By having a clear and organized structure in your code, it is easier to locate and fix bugs, implement new features, and understand the overall flow of the program. Additionally, by keeping your code neat and organized, you can also make it easier to debug and troubleshoot any issues that may arise. This can save you time and effort in the long run, and can also help you to be more productive.
In summary, being neat and organized when programming is important because it improves the readability, maintainability, and efficiency of your code, which can ultimately make you a better and more efficient programmer.
