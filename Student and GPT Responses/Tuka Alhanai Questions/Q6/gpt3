Improved readability: Being neat and organized when programming makes it easier for others to read and understand your code. This is particularly important when working on a team or when others will need to maintain or update your code in the future. Clear and consistent indentation, commenting, and naming conventions all help make your code more readable.
Reduced errors: Being neat and organized when programming can also help reduce errors. When code is messy and disorganized, it is more difficult to find and fix bugs. By keeping your code organized and well-structured, it becomes easier to locate and fix any issues that may arise. Additionally, by following good programming practices such as commenting, it is easier to understand the intent of the code, which will help you to identify any bugs or errors more quickly.
