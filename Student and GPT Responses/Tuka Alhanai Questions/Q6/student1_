It is important to be neat and organized when programming for the code to be readable and scalable. First, readable means that the code is easy to follow and hand over to another programmer. Second, scalable means that the code can be easily added to for the purpose of bigger applications. For example, if thereâ€™s a neat code that creates a simple social networking platform, it would be easy to add and edit functionalities in this code to make a larger application. Furthermore, neat code can possibly make the program interoperable, which means that the logic can be used for different applications and possible different programming languages.
