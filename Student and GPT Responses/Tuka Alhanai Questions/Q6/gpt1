Easier to read and understand: When code is well-organized and easy to read, it is much easier for others (and yourself) to understand what the program is doing and how it works. This can make it much easier to maintain and update the code, as well as collaborate with others on the project.
Fewer errors and bugs: When code is well-organized and easy to read, it's also more likely to be free of errors and bugs. This is because it's easier to spot and fix problems when the code is neatly organized, and it's less likely that new bugs will be introduced when making changes to the code. In addition, well-organized code is often more efficient as it's easier to find and fix performance bottlenecks.
