Error tracking / debugging: when your code is not neat and organized, it’s very difficult to track where the error is coming from and it’s hard to debug the code.
Collaboration: A neat and organized code is very important when we’re collaborating with others. Others should be able to read and understand what my code is trying to do, in order to add their work on top of my codes.
