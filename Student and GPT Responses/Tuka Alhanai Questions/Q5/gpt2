An object-oriented approach to programming is a programming paradigm that focuses on the use of objects and their interactions to design and write software. In object-oriented programming, the program is composed of objects, which are instances of classes, and the classes are organized into a hierarchy of inheritance. Each object has its own state and behavior, and it interacts with other objects through methods and messages.

A non-object-oriented approach to programming, also known as structured or procedural programming, is a programming paradigm that focuses on the use of procedures and functions to design and write software. In structured programming, a program is composed of a sequence of instructions, and it is organized into procedures and functions, which are reusable blocks of code. The state of the program is shared among all the procedures and functions, and there is no encapsulation of data.

In summary, the main difference between an object-oriented approach to programming and a non-object-oriented approach is the way they organize and structure the code. Object-oriented programming organizes code around objects, which are instances of classes, and focuses on the interaction between these objects. Non-object-oriented programming organizes code around procedures and functions, and focuses on the flow of control of the program. Object-oriented programming also allows for encapsulation of data and abstraction which makes it easier to understand and maintain, while non-object-oriented programming does not.
