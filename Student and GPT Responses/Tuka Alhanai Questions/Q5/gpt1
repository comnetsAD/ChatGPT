An object-oriented approach to programming, also known as OOP, is a programming paradigm that focuses on the use of objects and their interactions to design and develop software. It is based on the principles of encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.

In contrast, a non-object-oriented approach to programming does not rely on the use of objects and their interactions. It is based on a more procedural or functional approach to programming, where the focus is on writing code that performs specific tasks, rather than on creating and manipulating objects.

Some key differences between an object-oriented approach and a non-object-oriented approach include:
Encapsulation: In an object-oriented approach, data is typically encapsulated within objects, which are responsible for maintaining their own state and behavior. In a non-object-oriented approach, data is not encapsulated and is often accessible and modifiable by any part of the program.
Inheritance: In an object-oriented approach, classes can inherit properties and behavior from parent classes, allowing for code reuse. In a non-object-oriented approach, code reuse is typically achieved through the use of functions or modules.
Polymorphism: In an object-oriented approach, objects can have different forms or behaviors depending on their type or class. In a non-object-oriented approach, code is typically written to perform specific tasks, with little or no flexibility to handle different types of inputs or behaviors.
Abstraction: In an object-oriented approach, objects are designed to hide their internal implementation details and
