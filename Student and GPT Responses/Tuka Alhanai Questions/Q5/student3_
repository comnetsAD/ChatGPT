There are multiple differences between an object oriented programming approach as compared to a non-OOP one.
In an OOP approach, we try to containerize and divide the code into several interlinked but still self-contained bits through the implementation of links of datatypes such as classes & objects, whereas in a non-OOP based approach, we try to relay in all the information under one or more branches, leading to longer and often harder to comprehend code.
In an OOP approach, we incorporate several coding paradigms and techniques to save memory, from a more structurally coherent code while at the same time having better performance as compared to that in a non-OOP based approach.
