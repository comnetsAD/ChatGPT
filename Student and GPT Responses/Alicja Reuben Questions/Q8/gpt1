Given the information provided, it seems that the best structure for ABC Corp. would be a functional structure. This type of structure is best suited for organizations that operate in stable environments with clear, well-defined roles and tasks, and where there is a need for specialized expertise.

In a functional structure, employees are grouped together based on their area of expertise, such as production, marketing, or finance. The CEO would act as the top manager, with a few managers reporting directly to them. These managers would be responsible for overseeing the different functional areas of the company. Low-level employees would have little decision-making authority and would primarily be responsible for executing the procedures that have been established by the top managers.

This structure would be well-suited for ABC Corp. as it operates in a stable environment, has a clear product line, and sells primarily to other businesses. The company's small size, with only 20 employees, would also make it easy to manage and would allow for clear lines of communication between the CEO and the rest of the organization.
