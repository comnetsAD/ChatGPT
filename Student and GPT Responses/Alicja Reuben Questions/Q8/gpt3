What is the recommended structure for the company?

Based on the information provided, it appears that ABC Corp. operates in a stable environment with a well-defined product line, predictable customer base, and a small number of employees. Given these factors, a functional structure would likely be the most appropriate for the company.

A functional structure groups employees by their functional area, such as production, marketing, and finance. This structure is well-suited for stable environments where there is a clear division of labor and a well-defined set of tasks for each employee.

In this case, the CEO would have overall responsibility for the company, with each manager in charge of a specific functional area (e.g. production manager, marketing manager, finance manager). Low-level employees would have little decision-making authority, but they would have clearly defined roles and responsibilities. The company's highly documented procedures and fixed job descriptions would align with the functional structure.

This structure is easy to manage, it is efficient and it is cost-effective, especially for small organizations with a stable environment, where the product and customer base do not change significantly over time.
