I would recommend this company to gear towards a functional structure, due to the centralized system of decision making where decisions already come from the top and there is established tasks to be done for each employee in each part of the business. Also they have a stable environment meaning they don’t have to innovate much thus don’t need a structure with lots of inter-employee interaction to generate ideas.
