Structure can be diagnosed in two facets: Departmentalization and Organic vs. Mechanistic. I recommend a mechanistic structure for ABC Corp. since the decision making is highly centralized, the environment is stable and work does not require much creativity or innovation, and the system is highly formalized. 

In terms of departmentalization, employing a functional structure makes the most sense for the company because even though it has a small number of employees, since it has fixed jobs, high centralization – thus diverting from a team-based structure – and the work is consistent throughout, having a functional structure increases specialization. 

[Types of Departmentalization: Functional, Divisional, Multi-level, Matrix, Team-based, Network, Virtual
5 Dimensions of Structure: Division of Labor/Specialization, Formal Hierarchy/Chain of command, Span of Control, Centralization, Formalization]
