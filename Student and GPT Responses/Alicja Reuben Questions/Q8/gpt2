Based on the information provided, it seems that a hierarchical structure would be the most appropriate for ABC Corp. This type of structure is characterized by a clear chain of command and a clear division of labor. It is ideal for stable environments where there are few changes and a clear division of tasks and responsibilities.

The CEO would be at the top of the hierarchy, with the managers reporting to them. The managers would then be responsible for supervising the low-level employees. The low-level employees would have little decision-making authority and would be responsible for carrying out the tasks assigned to them according to the procedures that have been established.

Given that the company operates primarily in B2B and has a small number of employees, a flat organizational structure with fewer managers may be also a good fit, as it allows for a more efficient decision-making process and faster communication among the employees. This structure would also make it easy to adapt to the company's slow-changing and predictable market.

In addition, the company's highly documented procedures and fixed job descriptions align well with a hierarchical structure, as they promote clear roles, responsibilities and decision-making processes, which is beneficial in a stable environment.
