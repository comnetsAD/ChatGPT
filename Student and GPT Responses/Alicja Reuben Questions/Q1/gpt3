One key difference between the two companies is in their approach to risk-taking. Southwest Airlines is known for being a risk-taker, with a focus on being a "disruptor" in the airline industry. Disney, on the other hand, is known for being more cautious and focused on maintaining its reputation as a family-friendly entertainment company.

Finally, another key difference between the two companies is in their approach to leadership. Southwest Airlines has a more hierarchical leadership structure, with a focus on clear decision-making and accountability.
