Taking into account that both Southwest Airlines and Disney can and do offer seasonal jobs, experience somewhat of a high labor turnover in lower-ranking jobs, are customer-service focused, and offer specialized training for their employees internally,  the cultures in the two organizations are remarkably different. One significant difference relates to how employees treat each other in terms of respect and inter-organization competition. In both organizations, team work seems to be essential, but in Disney, employees seem to conform to a status quo based on hierarchy determined by importance of their work position, and are more likely to compete against each other for the prized role of Mickey Mouse or Princess Jasmine, whereas in Southwest, employees are take on any job needed despite their specialization, and interact widely with employees of all ranks, without the primary goal being their personal career advancement.
Another difference between these two is how they treat customers. In Disney, the image of customer services being top-notch is highly fabricated and employees are watched continuously to ensure the Disneyland image is upheld to the highest standard, to the point where they feel under surveillance and have to dissociate on the job to maintain individuality (if you ask me, that’s a little scary). Southwest on the other hand seems to have a more organic approach to customer service, where not only are they trained to put customer first, the employees themselves hold those values and therefore are able to fulfill their tasks with ingenuity and offer a helpful hand even when outside of their scope of work (such as watching someone’s dog while they’re on holiday).
All in all, Southwest seems to have employees whose goals are more aligned with the company goals and strategy allowing it to become a USP on its own, whereas Disney has a culture that often threatens strategy and requires constant oversight.
