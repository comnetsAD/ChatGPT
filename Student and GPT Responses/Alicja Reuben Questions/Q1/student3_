I will analyze the differences between the organizational cultures of Disney and of Southwest through observing them from one of the four primary dimensions of culture: Individual initiative.

Southwest takes on a culture that motivates individuality, through allowing diversity in dress, manner, freedom of expression, and opportunity for the workers to see themselves as valuable members of the company. This is also through the sense of community - birthday parties, company traditions and events - and mutual respect between leadership and employees through high job security and a motivating recruitment process. 

On the other hand, Disney takes on a culture where employees are largely stripped from their individuality and become part of the machine that is the company. This of course has it’s benefits - such as assuring that everyone in the organization is aligned with and aware of the goals of the company. However, this lack of individuality or freedom to express one selves without repercussions stunts creativity, risk taking, and most importantly, speaking up. Disney’s organizational culture makes it difficult for employees to speak up against discrimination or injustice and defend themselves without the fear of getting fired. While this rigid culture could be less work and expense to Disney, it prevents the growth of employee loyalty and genuine commitment, that is a great asset.
