Formalization is the existence of laws, rules, and regulations, that are documented, communicated, implemented by the organization and all employees. Since, ABC Corp. has “highly documented procedures and carefully crafted and fixed job descriptions” it is highly formalized. Centralization refers to the decision-making authority: highly centralized means the decision-making is by a select few at the top of the hierarchy while decentralized means decision-making is part of many individuals of the company’s roles. Since, in ABC Corp. “low-level employees have little decision-making authority” and there aren’t many managers -meaning that the CEO is responsible for the bulk of the decision making, this company is highly centralized.
