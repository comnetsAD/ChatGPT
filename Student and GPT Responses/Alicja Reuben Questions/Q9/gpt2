ABC Corp. has a high degree of formalization and centralization.

Formalization refers to the level of standardization and documentation in an organization, and ABC Corp. has highly documented procedures, with the job description of every employee carefully crafted and remaining fixed. This indicates a high level of formalization in the company.

Centralization refers to the degree to which decision-making authority is concentrated at the top of an organization. In ABC Corp., the CEO is the highest authority and everyone reports to him through a few managers. Low-level employees have little decision-making authority, indicating a high degree of centralization in the company.

The stability of the environment and the nature of the product that is sold to other businesses, along with the small size of the organization, may have contributed to the high degree of formalization and centralization in the company. This allows the company to have a clear chain of command and a streamlined decision-making process, which can be useful in maintaining consistency and efficiency in its operations.
