Extrinsic motivations focus on incentives and things not related to human psychology such as pay and job title. Intrinsic motivations refer to internal, self-motivations of humans including feeling a sense of accomplishment and being respected by others. When focusing too hard on extrinsic motivators, employers might overlook and undermine the power of intrinsic motivators. For examples, some employees who are continuously getting promoted and higher pay may still choose to quit the company because leadership does not praise work or promote challengin and intrinsically rewarding tasks. Therefore, my focusing on pay and extrinsic motivators, leadership overlooked the employees need for the intrinsic ones.
