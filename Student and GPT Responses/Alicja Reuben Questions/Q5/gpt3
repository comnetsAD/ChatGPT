Extrinsic motivation refers to the external factors that drive behavior, such as rewards or punishments. These are external incentives that are used to encourage or discourage certain behavior, such as a bonus for meeting a sales quota or a demotion for poor performance. Extrinsic motivation can be powerful in shaping behavior, but it can also be seen as controlling and can decrease the intrinsic motivation.

Intrinsic motivation, on the other hand, refers to internal factors that drive behavior, such as personal interest, curiosity, or enjoyment. Intrinsic motivation is driven by an internal desire to do something because it is interesting, challenging or enjoyable, rather than because of external rewards or punishments. It is considered more self-determined and autonomous, and it is more likely to lead to sustainable long-term behavior change.

An example of how extrinsic motivation can thwart intrinsic motivation is a teacher offering a candy to students who answer the questions correctly in class. The students will be motivated by the candy, and they will answer the questions to get the candy, but they may not be motivated to learn or understand the subject. In this way, the candy is a form of extrinsic motivation that crowds out intrinsic motivation to learn the material.

In conclusion, extrinsic and intrinsic motivation are two different types of motivation that can shape behavior, but they have different effects. Extrinsic motivation can be powerful, but it can also decrease intrinsic motivation, whereas intrinsic motivation is more self-determined and autonomous and is more likely to lead to sustainable long-term behavior change.
