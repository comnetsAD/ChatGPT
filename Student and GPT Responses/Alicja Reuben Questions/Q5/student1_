Extrinsic motivation is generated by an outside reward for doing something. For example, getting a job promotion which results in higher pay and more days off. Intrinsic motivation relates to internal factors important to the individual such as having an impact on the environment or gaining new experiences.
Crowding out intrinsic motivation with extrinsic rewards is a well studied theory. If we use extrinsic rewards for certain types of tasks, it may result in a decrease of intrinsic motivation to complete that task. For example paying someone to do their school work might result in them not wanting to do their work once that incentive is gone because their motivation is no longer for learning but it is generated by financial rewards.
