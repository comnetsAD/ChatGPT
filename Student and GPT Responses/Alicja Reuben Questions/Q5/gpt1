Extrinsic motivation refers to the external factors that drive an individual to engage in a certain behavior, such as rewards or punishments. Examples of extrinsic motivation include money, promotions, or grades. Intrinsic motivation, on the other hand, refers to the internal factors that drive an individual to engage in a behavior, such as personal interest, enjoyment, or a sense of accomplishment.

An example of how extrinsic motivation can thwart intrinsic motivation is when a student is given a reward for reading a book. Before the reward, the student may have been interested in the book and motivated to read it for personal enjoyment. However, once the reward is introduced, the student may begin to focus solely on earning the reward and lose interest in the book itself. This is an example of how extrinsic motivation can "crowd-out" intrinsic motivation, as the external reward becomes the primary motivator, rather than the internal interest in the activity.

In general, extrinsic motivation can be effective in the short-term, but it may not sustain the motivation over time. Intrinsic motivation, on the other hand, can be more sustainable, as it is based on personal interest and enjoyment of the task or activity. In organizations, it is important to find a balance between both types of motivation, to achieve a long-term success.
