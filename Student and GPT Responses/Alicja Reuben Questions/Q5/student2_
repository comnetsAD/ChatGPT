intrinsic motivation involves doing something because it's personally rewarding to you extrinsic motivation is when you do something because you want to earn an award. when getting asked to do something out of kindness and then accepting but when money is offered on the table you question it twice like the example we took in class. should i do it now or not? is it worth the money?
