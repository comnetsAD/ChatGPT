Extrinsic motivation refers to the external factors that drive an individual to engage in a particular behavior. These external factors can include rewards such as money, bonuses, or praise, or penalties such as fines or reprimands. Extrinsic motivation is often used to encourage people to perform specific tasks or to achieve specific goals.

Intrinsic motivation, on the other hand, refers to the internal factors that drive an individual to engage in a particular behavior. These internal factors include personal interests, values, or a sense of fulfillment. Intrinsic motivation is often associated with a sense of personal satisfaction or enjoyment in the task itself.

An example of how extrinsic motivation can thwart intrinsic motivation is when an employee is given a monetary bonus for meeting a sales quota. Initially, the employee may be motivated to meet the quota by the promise of the bonus. However, over time, the employee may come to view the task of selling as solely a means to an end (getting the bonus) rather than something they enjoy or find meaningful. As a result, the employee may lose their intrinsic motivation to sell and become less engaged in their work.

In conclusion, extrinsic motivation is a way to encourage people to perform specific tasks or to achieve specific goals, while intrinsic motivation is an internal factor that drive an individual to engage in a particular behavior, and it is often associated with a sense of personal satisfaction or enjoyment. However, when the extrinsic motivation becomes the only or main driver, it could crowd-out intrinsic motivation, leading to less engagement and less satisfied employee.
