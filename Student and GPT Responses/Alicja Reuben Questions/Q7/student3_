Group gains include wins for the group during their process towards achieving their objectives while group losses refer to the draw backs of the group during the process. 
Group gains: 1) The specialization diversity in the group promotes looking at the tasks from different perspectives â€“ commerce, agriculture, and transport 2) The individuals have strong sources of power making them able to facilitate change and action
Group losses: 1) the group is susceptible to group think because they are made of leaders all within similar positions and within the same political and social spheres thus lacking perspective
