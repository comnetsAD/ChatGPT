Attention to detail: This dimension refers to the level of emphasis placed on precision, accuracy, and thoroughness in an organization. A company that exhibits this dimension of organizational culture is Amazon, which is known for its focus on data and metrics to guide decision-making and its rigorous standards for quality and efficiency in all aspects of its operations.
Outcome Orientation: This dimension refers to the extent to which an organization emphasizes performance, productivity, and achieving results over other factors such as socializing or meeting process goals. A company that exhibits this dimension of organizational culture is Tesla, which is known for its intense focus on achieving ambitious goals in a short amount of time and its relentless pursuit of innovation and progress.
