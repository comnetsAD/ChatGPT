Innovation and risk-taking: This dimension refers to the extent to which a company encourages and rewards creativity and taking calculated risks. An example of this dimension is Google, which is known for its 20% time policy, where employees are given 20% of their work time to pursue projects of their own interest.
Attention to detail: This dimension refers to the level of precision and thoroughness a company expects in its work processes. An example of this dimension is Tesla, which emphasizes attention to detail in its manufacturing process to ensure high-quality products.
Outcome orientation: This dimension refers to the extent to which a company focuses on achieving specific goals and targets. An example of this dimension is Amazon, which is known for its intense focus on achieving performance targets and continuously improving its operations.
