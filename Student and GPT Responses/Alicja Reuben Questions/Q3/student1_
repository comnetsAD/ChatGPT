Competitiveness refers to how much employees compete with each other instead of working together. Low competitiveness is for example seen in Big Spaceship with all team members collaborating on projects and pitching in with ideas and their expertise.
Autonomy is how much freedom employees have over their work. One example is IDEO as they brainstorm ideas in their own ways and can go about their work in a way that they would like.
Power distance refers to how much formal hierarchy is followed within the company. One example of a low power distance is also IDEO as all employees are treated equally and even the CEO is there with them working, not giving out orders. Apple would be the opposite as hierarchy is highly emphasized.
 
It's important to note that different companies may exhibit different dimensions of organizational culture, and one single company may exhibit different dimensions depending on the department, region or time.
