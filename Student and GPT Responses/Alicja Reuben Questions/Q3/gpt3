Three out of the seven dimensions of organizational culture are:
Innovation and risk-taking: This dimension refers to the degree to which employees are encouraged and allowed to be creative and take risks in their work. An example of a company that exhibits this dimension is Google, known for its innovative culture and willingness to take risks and try new things.
Attention to detail: This dimension refers to the degree to which employees are expected to pay attention to details and maintain high standards of accuracy in their work. An example of a company that exhibits this dimension is Mercedes-Benz, known for its focus on precision and quality in the manufacturing of its cars.
Outcome orientation: This dimension refers to the degree to which the organization is focused on achieving specific goals and results, rather than just following a set of processes. An example of a company that exhibits this dimension is Amazon, which is known for its intense focus on customer satisfaction and measurable outcomes.
