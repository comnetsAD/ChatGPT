Pros to diversity would be more ideas coming from different perspectives that aid innovation. It can also improve decision making as a more diverse organization may make more ethical and socially conscious decisions.
Some cons to diversity is that it can create disagreements on best practices because people might be used to doing things differently and it can also slow decision making because it would be hard to reach a consensus because everyone might have different opinions on things.
