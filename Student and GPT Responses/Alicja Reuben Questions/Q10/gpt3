Would you say ABC is more mechanistic or more organic?

Based on the information provided, it appears that ABC Corp. is more mechanistic in terms of its organizational structure and management style.

Mechanistic organizations are characterized by a high degree of formalization, centralization, and specialization. They are typically highly structured and have a clear hierarchy of authority, with decision-making power concentrated at the top levels of the organization. They also tend to have a clear set of rules and procedures that employees are expected to follow, and job descriptions are often fixed and narrowly defined.

In the case of ABC Corp., the company has a CEO to whom everyone reports through a few managers, and low-level employees have little decision-making authority. The company has highly documented procedures and the job description of every employee is carefully crafted and remains fixed. These characteristics are consistent with a mechanistic organizational structure.

On the other hand, Organic organizations are characterized by a more flexible, decentralized structure, with decision-making power distributed throughout the organization. They tend to be less formalized, with less emphasis on rules and procedures, and more emphasis on employee autonomy and creativity. They tend to be more adaptable to change and have a more flexible approach to problem-solving.

In the case of ABC Corp., the company does not have those characteristics. Therefore, it is considered more mechanistic than organic.
