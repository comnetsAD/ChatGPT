Based on the information provided, it appears that ABC Corp. is more mechanistic in terms of its organizational structure.

A mechanistic organization is one that is highly centralized, with clear lines of authority and a formalized structure. It is characterized by a high degree of formalization, with strict rules and procedures that guide the behavior of employees. It is also characterized by a clear division of labor and a high degree of specialization among employees.

ABC Corp. has a clear hierarchy, with a CEO at the top and a few managers who report to the CEO. Low-level employees have little decision-making authority, and the company has highly documented procedures and fixed job descriptions. This suggests that the company is highly centralized and follows strict rules and procedures. It also suggests that the company is specialized and with a clear division of labor.

On the other hand, an organic organization is one that is more decentralized, with a flatter hierarchy and a more flexible structure. It is characterized by a high degree of autonomy and a relatively low degree of formalization. It is also characterized by a high degree of cross-functional collaboration and a more dynamic approach to decision-making.

Given this information, ABC Corp. is more mechanistic than organic. In a stable environment, a mechanistic structure can be effective as it allows for clear lines of authority, formalized procedures, and efficient use of resources.
