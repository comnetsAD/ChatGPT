Based on the information provided, ABC Corp. is more mechanistic in its organizational structure.

Mechanistic organizations are characterized by a high degree of formalization, centralization, and specialization. They have a clear hierarchy, with defined roles and responsibilities, and a clear chain of command. This is evident in ABC Corp. with a CEO to whom everyone reports, highly documented procedures and job descriptions, and little decision-making authority for low-level employees.

On the other hand, organic organizations are characterized by a more flexible structure, with less formalization, decentralization, and a higher degree of employee autonomy. They tend to be more adaptable and responsive to change, with a flat hierarchy and less rigid roles and responsibilities.

In conclusion, ABC Corp. has a more mechanistic structure, as it has a high degree of formalization, centralization, and specialized roles and responsibilities, which is consistent with the stable environment where changes occur slowly, and product categories do not differ significantly over time.
