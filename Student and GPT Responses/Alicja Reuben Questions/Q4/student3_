Culture is formed through factors such as leadership, the workforce â€“ which is decided in the hiring process -, cultural artifacts, team building, and training. In the short-term, I would recommend the company eradicate any pay-by-performance and instead place people in teams to work together. Secondly, they can organize trainings for team and community building such as office events, sports, leadership, and teamwork seminars. Thirdly, leadership through communication and motivation can foster a healthier environment by giving speeches about teamwork at the beginning of meetings and placing employees in activities where they must work together. In the long-term, I would recommend reassessing their hiring process to consider employees that are more socially engaged.
