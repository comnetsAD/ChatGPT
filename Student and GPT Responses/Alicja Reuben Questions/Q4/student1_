1.    Take the company on a camping trip where employees and employers can play
team-building games and trust building exercises to promote cooperation, as opposed to
constant competitiveness, and offer less of a power distance.
2. Create a conflict box in which members of the company can anonymously submit issues
they are having to be read allowed at the end of the month and discussed.
3. Have top managers switch roles with lower level employees for a day, so that both sides
can learn to appreciate the work that the other does, both limiting the power distance
and possibly offering opportunity for greater individual initiative based on the
demonstration of skills.
