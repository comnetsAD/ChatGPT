The “Great Person” and “Be a Leader” theories both illustrated that leadership could come from nature – the big 5 – and nurture – the environment and learned attitude. The big 5 are 1) Openness 2) Conscientiousness 3) Extroversion 4) Agreeableness 5) Neuroticism. An experiment to test the relationship between the big 5 and leadership would look involve gathering a large group of participants, giving them the big 5 test, and dividing them into two groups.
Control: the group of participants with the average levels in Big 5 (of a normal person) and provide them a leadership question or task and see how they respond. 
Experiment: the group of participants with the big 5 levels resembling those of leadership positions and provide them a leadership question or task and see how they respond. 
The hypothesis is that the experiment group would score higher than the control group because there big 5 are related to leadership qualities.
