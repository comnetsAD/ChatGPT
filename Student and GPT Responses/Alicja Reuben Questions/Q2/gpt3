One way to study the relationship between the Big 5 personality traits and leadership would be to conduct a correlational study. The following is an example of how such a study could be designed:

Recruit a sample of participants who are currently in leadership positions, such as managers or team leaders.
Administer a measure of the Big 5 personality traits, such as the NEO-PI-R, to all participants.
Collect data on participants' leadership effectiveness, using a valid and reliable leadership assessment tool, such as the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) or the Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI).
Correlate scores on the Big 5 measure with scores on the leadership effectiveness measure, using a statistical software package.
Interpret the results and report the strength and direction of any significant correlations that are found.

It is important to note that correlation does not prove causation, this study design only allows to establish a relationship between the variable and it is important to conduct further research, such as a causal study, to establish causality.
