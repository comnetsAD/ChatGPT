You can test the Big 5 traits of leadership by inviting someone to a party and observing how theyinteract with those around them. Ask yourself: Are they open and willing to meet new people?Are they conscientious about making a good impression? Are they extraverted and happy toengage in conversation with others, easy to approach? Are they “agreeable” or well-liked by yourfriends? Did they demonstrate any sort of neuroticism (did they become anxious, irritated,maybe they took this as an opportunity to drink away their problems..)?
