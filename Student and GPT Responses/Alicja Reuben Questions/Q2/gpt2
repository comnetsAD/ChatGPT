One way to design a study on the Big 5 personality traits and leadership is to use a sample of leaders from various organizations and have them complete a personality assessment measuring the Big 5 traits (e.g., the NEO-PI-R). The study can then examine the correlation between scores on each of the Big 5 traits and measures of leadership effectiveness (e.g., ratings from subordinates, peers, and superiors). Additionally, the study can also include control variables such as age, gender, tenure, and education level to control for any potential confounding effects.

Another way would be to use a sample of individuals and randomly assign them to leader or follower roles in a group setting. Then, measure the participants' Big 5 traits before and after the group task and compare the changes in personality between leaders and followers. This design allows for a causal inference about the effect of leadership role on personality.

It is also possible to combine both approaches above and investigate the relationship between the Big 5 traits, leadership role and leadership effectiveness.
