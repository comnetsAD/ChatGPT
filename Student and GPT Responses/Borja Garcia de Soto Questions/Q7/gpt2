I do not agree with my colleague's statement that free float is the total amount of time an activity can be delayed from its early start date without delaying the project's finish date.

Free float is the amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying the early start date of any subsequent activity. It is calculated as the difference between the activity's latest finish date and the early start date of the next activity. It represents the amount of time an activity can be delayed without affecting any other activities in the project schedule.

On the other hand, Total Float is the amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying the project's completion date. It is calculated as the difference between the activity's latest finish date and the project's completion date.

So, in summary, Free float represents the flexibility of an activity in relation to the immediate successor activities, while Total float represents the flexibility of an activity in relation to the whole project completion.

It is important to have a clear understanding of the concepts of free float and total float when managing a project schedule, as they are key indicators of schedule performance and can help identify potential schedule risks.
