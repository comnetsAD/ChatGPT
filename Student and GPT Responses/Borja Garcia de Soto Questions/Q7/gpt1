I do not agree with my colleague's statement that free float is the total amount of time an activity can be delayed from its early start date without delaying the project's finish date.

Free float, also known as total float, is the amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying the early start date of any dependent activities. It represents the amount of scheduling flexibility that an activity has without affecting the project's overall schedule.

A more accurate statement would be: "Free float is the amount of time an activity can be delayed without delaying the early start date of any dependent activities."

It is important to understand the difference between free float and total float, as it can have a significant impact on the project schedule and the critical path. The critical path is the sequence of activities that determines the duration of the project and any delay in the critical path activities will delay the project finish date.

In summary, free float represents the amount of scheduling flexibility that an activity has without affecting the schedule of the dependent activities and not the project finish date.
