Liquidated damages are used in construction contracts to address compensation to the owner in case of delays caused by the contractor. They are not penalties but based on a reasonable assumption of the cost of delaying the project (for example, for a hotel, the expected losses incurred by the owner if not able to operate the hotel on the day it was planned). They are important because create a contractual obligation to compensate the owner in case of contractor-cause delays (or non-excusable delays).
