Liquidated Damages (LDs) are considered pre-determined cost calculated when a contract is agreed by both parties. The amount is an estimation of the actual losses the owner is likely to incur due to delays within the control of the contractor (for example, the contractor or subcontractors are slow in the performance of their work). In this case, the contractor cannot get time extension or relief from LDs.
