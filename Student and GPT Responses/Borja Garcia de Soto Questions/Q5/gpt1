Liquidated damages (LDs) are a pre-determined sum of money agreed upon by the parties involved in a construction project, that the contractor will pay to the owner if they fail to complete the project on time or in accordance with the contract terms. The purpose of liquidated damages is to compensate the owner for any losses or damages incurred as a result of the contractor's delay.

LDs are important in construction projects because they provide a mechanism for the owner to recover losses resulting from delays caused by the contractor. They also serve as an incentive for the contractor to complete the project on time, as they will be financially penalized if they do not. LDs also provide a way to establish a clear and objective measure of delay, and to avoid disputes over whether a delay occurred, how much it cost and who is responsible for it.

It's important to note that the amount of liquidated damages should be a reasonable estimate of the actual damages that the owner would incur as a result of the delay, and not be seen as a penalty. If the amount of liquidated damages is too high or too low, it may be considered as unenforceable.

Also, it's important to be aware that Liquidated damages are different from general damages, where the latter are determined by the court and its related to the actual losses occurred to the owner, and not agreed upon in the contract.
