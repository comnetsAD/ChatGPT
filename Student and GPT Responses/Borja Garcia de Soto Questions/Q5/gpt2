Liquidated damages (LD) are a specific amount of money that is agreed upon by the parties involved in a construction contract as a predetermined form of compensation for a party's failure to meet its contractual obligations. This is typically included in the contract as a clause and they are intended to compensate the non-breaching party for losses incurred as a result of the delay or default. They are usually calculated as a fixed dollar amount per day, week or month of delay.

They are important in construction projects because they provide a clear and measurable way for the parties to understand and quantify the potential financial consequences of not meeting their contractual obligations. This can act as a deterrent to the party that might be tempted to cause delays or defaults. Additionally, they can help to provide a sense of certainty and predictability for the parties involved with the project, which can be beneficial for budgeting and planning purposes.

It's important to note that Liquidated Damages are not considered as penalties but as a fair estimate of the actual damages that the non-breaching party would incur. Therefore, the amount of liquidated damages should be reasonable, not excessive and not less than the actual damages that the non-breaching party is likely to incur.

Additionally, Liquidated Damages clauses should be reviewed by legal experts to ensure that they comply with the laws of the jurisdiction in which the project is located, and that the amount is reasonable and not considered as a penalty.
