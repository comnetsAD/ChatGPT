Resource leveling and resource smoothing are both techniques used to manage resources in a project, but they have different objectives and approaches.

Resource leveling is the process of adjusting the project schedule to ensure that resources are used in an efficient and effective manner. It involves adjusting the start and finish dates of activities to ensure that resources are not over allocated or underutilized. The goal of resource leveling is to avoid overloading any resource, such as a person, machine or material, and to ensure that all resources are used in an optimal way.

Resource smoothing, on the other hand, is a technique used to balance the workload of resources over time. It involves adjusting the start and finish dates of activities to ensure that resources are not overloaded at any given time. The goal of resource smoothing is to make the resource usage more predictable and consistent, avoiding peaks and valleys in resource usage.

If you cannot extend the project duration, I would recommend resource leveling. The reason being, resource leveling adjusts the project schedule to ensure that resources are used in an efficient and effective manner. It can help to avoid delays in completing activities due to resource constraints. Since the end date of the project cannot be delayed, it is important to make sure that the resources are used in an optimal way to achieve the project objectives in the given time frame.

Resource smoothing is a useful technique when the project schedule is flexible and the duration can be extended, but in this case, the goal is to complete the project on time, and resource leveling is the best approach to achieve this.
