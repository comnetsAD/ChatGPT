Resource leveling and resource smoothing are two techniques that are used to manage resources in a project. The main difference between the two is their focus and goals.

Resource leveling is a technique that focuses on leveling out the overall resource usage throughout the project schedule. It is used to ensure that resources are not over-allocated at any given time, and that resources are used as efficiently as possible. Resource leveling is often used when there are resource constraints on a project, and it is essential to ensure that resources are used in a balanced way throughout the project schedule.

Resource smoothing, on the other hand, is a technique that focuses on smoothing out the resource usage over time. It is used to ensure that resources are used in a more predictable and consistent manner throughout the project schedule. Resource smoothing is often used when there are no resource constraints on a project, and the goal is to make resource usage more predictable and consistent.

If the project duration cannot be extended, I would recommend resource leveling. Resource leveling is a technique that allows you to balance the use of resources throughout the project schedule, ensuring that resources are not over-allocated at any given time. This approach will help to ensure that the project is completed on time, without delays caused by resource constraints.

Resource smoothing aims to make resource usage more predictable and consistent, but in situations where the project duration cannot be extended, it is more important to ensure that the project is completed on time, hence resource leveling will be the best approach.
