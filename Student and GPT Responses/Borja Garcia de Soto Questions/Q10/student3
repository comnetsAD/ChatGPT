Leveling has a constrain about the amount of resources that can be used. To meet that constrain, the logic of the activities or their start/finish days might have to be modified to ensure that the constraints are satisfied. This means that the project might take longer than originally planned. On the other hand, smoothing does not consider the resource limit and uses the available float in the schedule to reduce the resource fluctuation within the original project duration (no project delays). Therefore, resource smoothing would be the best option if the project duration cannot be extended.
