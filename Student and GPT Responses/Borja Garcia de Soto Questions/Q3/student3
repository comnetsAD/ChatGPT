For Design Bid Build (architect more authority)
Advantage: well documented – cost of construction known before start of construction work
Disadvantage: slow – conflict between the architect and the GC can occur
For Design Build (contractor more authority)
Advantage: fast-track. There is space for innovation and quality improvement.
Disadvantage: It takes away the changes from small local construction organizations – low competition which means higher cost and risk
I would personally go with IPD because in this integration different parties work together to reduce waste and maximize efficiency in order to reach the desired goal. In this delivery system different departments/organizations come together early on to reach the desired project objectives.
