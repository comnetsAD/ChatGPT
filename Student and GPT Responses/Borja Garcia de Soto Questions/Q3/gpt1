Design-Bid-Build (DBB) and Design-Build (DB) are two common project delivery systems used in the construction industry.

Design-Bid-Build (DBB) is a traditional method in which the owner hires an architect or engineer to design the project, and then puts the project out for bid to contractors. The owner then selects a contractor to build the project based on the lowest bid.

Advantages of DBB:
The owner has control over the design and can ensure that it meets their specific needs and requirements
The design and construction are separated, which can reduce the risk of conflicts between the designer and contractor
The owner has the ability to compare bids and select the contractor that offers the best value

Disadvantages of DBB:
The design and construction process can take longer, as the design must be completed before the project can be put out for bid
There may be a lack of collaboration between the designer and contractor, which can lead to cost overruns and delays
The design and construction process can be less efficient, as the designer and contractor may not have an opportunity to work together to optimize the project and reduce waste

Design-Build (DB) is a project delivery system in which the owner hires a single entity, called a design-builder, to design and construct the project. This allows for more collaboration between the designer and contractor, and can lead to more efficient and cost-effective solutions.

Advantages of DB:
The design and construction process can be more efficient, as the designer and contractor are working together from the beginning of the project
The design-builder is responsible for the overall project, which can lead to better coordination and less risk of delays or cost overruns
The design-builder can provide value engineering and can optimize the project to reduce waste and increase value

Disadvantages of DB:
The owner may have less control over the design, as the design-builder is responsible for both the design and construction
The owner may not have the opportunity to compare bids and select the contractor that offers the best value
There may be a lack of transparency, as the owner may not have access to the detailed information about the project costs.

If I want to have a collaborative way to optimize project results, increase value, and reduce waste through all phases of the project, I would choose the Design-Build (DB) project delivery system. This is because the Design-Build (DB) system allows for more collaboration between the designer and contractor, which can lead to more efficient and cost-effective solutions. Additionally, the design-builder is responsible for the overall project, which can lead to better coordination and less risk of delays or cost overruns. Also, the design-builder can provide value engineering and can optimize the project to reduce waste and increase value.
