Design-bid-build (DBB) and design-build (DB) are two common project delivery systems in construction.

Advantages of DBB include:
Clarity of roles and responsibilities
Competitive bidding process can lead to cost savings
Design and construction are separate phases, allowing for design to be completed before construction begins

Disadvantages of DBB include:
Longer project timelines
Increased likelihood of change orders
Limited opportunity for cost savings through value engineering

Advantages of DB include:
Shorter project timelines
Increased collaboration between design and construction teams can lead to cost savings through value engineering
Single point of responsibility for the design and construction

Disadvantages of DB include:
Limited competition can lead to higher costs
Collaboration can lead to disputes between the design-build team

If I want to have a collaborative way to optimize project results, increase value, and reduce waste through all phases of the project, I would choose a design-build project delivery system. This is because the design-build system allows for increased collaboration between design and construction teams, which can lead to cost savings through value engineering, and a single point of responsibility for the design and construction.
