DBB allows the owner to choose the best price among contractors from competition, while DB might be more cost. However, as for DB, the designer and contractor are form one entity, the design and construction can be collaborated at the initial stage and avoid the cost of making changes once construction starts, which is more likely to occur for DBB.
IDP could be a good project delivery system for this project. It is a project delivery system that allows the architect, designer, contractor, and everyone from every part of the project to collaborate together from the beginning process. In that wat, it could efficiently reduce any possible waste that might happen later in the project and make the most value of the project.
