Design-Bid-Build (DBB) and Design-Build (DB) are two common project delivery systems used in construction projects.

Advantages of DBB:
Well-established and widely used
Separates design and construction phases, allowing for greater design flexibility and innovation
Allows for competitive bidding, which can lead to lower costs
Owner retains more control over the project

Disadvantages of DBB:
Longer project duration
Design and construction phases are not always well-coordinated, leading to potential for delays and increased costs
The design and construction process is less collaborative
The owner does not have the opportunity to optimize the value or reduce waste through all phases of the project

Advantages of DB:
Shorter project duration
Greater collaboration between design and construction teams, leading to better coordination and more efficient use of resources
The design and construction process is more integrated, leading to greater value and less waste
Greater opportunity for innovation and cost savings

Disadvantages of DB:
Less competitive bidding, which can lead to higher costs
Owner has less control over the project

If I want to have a collaborative way to optimize project results, increase value, and reduce waste through all phases of the project, I would choose the Design-Build (DB) project delivery system. This is because the DB system is characterized by greater collaboration between design and construction teams, leading to better coordination and more efficient use of resources. Additionally, the design and construction process is more integrated, leading to greater value and less waste. The DB system also provides greater opportunity for innovation and cost savings.
