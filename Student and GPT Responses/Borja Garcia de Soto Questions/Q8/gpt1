To calculate the total cost (labor and materials) for the task "concrete work in roof" we need to first calculate the total installation units required, and then multiply that by the cost of materials per installed unit. Then we need to multiply the daily cost of C-8 crew ($3,027) by the number of days required to complete the work to get the labor cost. Finally, we add the labor cost and the cost of materials to get the total cost of the task.

Here is the calculation:
First, we need to determine the number of installation units required. For concrete work, we can use the area of the roof as a basis.
76,000 sq. ft. / 10 sq. ft. = 7600 installation units
Next, we need to calculate the cost of materials by multiplying the number of installation units by the cost per unit.
7600 x 1.85 = $14,040
Now we need to calculate the labor cost. We will use the daily cost of C-8 crew and assume that the task will take 10 days to complete.
3,027 x 10 = $30,270
Finally, we add the labor cost and the cost of materials to get the total cost of the task.
$30,270 + $14,040 = $44,310

So the total cost (labor and materials) for the task "concrete work in roof" is $44,310

It is worth mentioning that this calculation is based on the assumption that the scope of work only includes concrete work and the use of a single C-8 crew without any modifications. Additionally, it is also assuming that there's no need of equipment rental, supervision, and other indirect costs. In reality, there may be other costs that need to be factored in to get a more accurate estimate.
