To calculate the total cost (labor and materials) for the task "concrete work in roof," we need to calculate the cost of labor and materials separately and then add them together.

First, we will calculate the cost of labor:
RSMeans crew code C-8 has a daily cost of $3,027.
We will use only one C-8 crew for this project.
The total roof area is 76,000 square feet, which will require 76000/20 = 3,800 units of concrete to install.
The duration of the task is 3,800 units / 6.2 (production rate) = 613.11 days
The total cost of labor is $3,027 x 613.11 = $1,857,622.37

Next, we will calculate the cost of materials:
The cost of materials is 1.85 per installed unit.
The total cost of materials is 1.85 x 3,800 = $7,030

Finally, we will add the cost of labor and materials together to get the total cost of the task:
$1,857,622.37 + $7,030 = $1,864,652.37

Therefore, the total cost (labor and materials) for the task "concrete work in roof" is $1,864,652.37

It's important to note that this estimate is based on the assumptions provided and that other factors such as weather conditions, site-specific challenges, and unforeseen changes to the scope of work could affect the final cost.
