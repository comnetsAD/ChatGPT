To calculate the total cost (labor and materials) for the task "concrete work in roof" you will need to determine the total cost of labor and the total cost of materials.

The first step is to calculate the total cost of labor. The RSMeans crew code C-8 has a daily cost of $3,027. To find the total labor cost, you would multiply the daily cost by the number of days it will take to complete the task. Since the scope of the project is only related to the concrete work and no other information is provided about the time frame or the size of the crew, it's difficult to give a specific time frame or labor cost.

The second step is to calculate the total cost of materials. The total roof area is 76,000 square feet. According to the information provided the cost of materials is 1.85 per installed unit. Without knowing the unit of measurement for the installed unit, it's impossible to calculate the total cost of materials.

In order to provide an accurate cost estimate for this task, it would be necessary to have more information about the scope of the project, the time frame, and the unit of measurement for the installed unit.
