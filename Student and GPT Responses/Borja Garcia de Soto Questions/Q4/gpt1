To determine the duration of the task for installing 70 tons of rebar for structural concrete elements, we need to calculate the amount of time it will take for the normal installation crew (with a production rate of 6.2 units per day) to complete the task.

The production rate of the crew is 6.2 units per day. Since a ton of rebar equals 2200 pounds, then 70 tons of rebar is equal to (2200*70=154000 pounds). The installation crew can install 6.2 units per day and each unit is equal to 154000/6.2 = 24,677.42 pounds of rebar.

Therefore, the duration of the task would be 154000/24677.42 = 6.2 days approximately.

It's important to consider that this is just an estimation and the actual duration of the task may vary depending on site conditions, weather, and other factors. It's also important to consider contingencies and safety margins into the schedule.

So, I would recommend a duration of 6 to 7 days for this task to the project manager to include in the bid.
