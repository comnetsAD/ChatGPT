To determine the duration of the task of installing 70 tons of rebar for structural concrete elements, I would use the following formula:

Duration (in days) = Quantity of work (in tons) / Production rate (in tons per day)

In this case, the Quantity of work is 70 tons and the Production rate is 6.2 tons per day.

So, the duration for the task would be:
70 / 6.2 = 11.29 days

It is recommended to round it up to the nearest whole number, so the duration that I would recommend to the project manager for this task to include in the bid is 12 days.

It is worth mentioning that this calculation is based on the assumption that the standard labor and equipment configuration of a normal installation crew will be used and that the production rate of 6.2 units per day is accurate. Any changes to these assumptions could affect the duration of the task. Additionally, it would be important to consider potential unforeseen circumstances, such as weather conditions or site-specific challenges, that could affect the duration of the task.
