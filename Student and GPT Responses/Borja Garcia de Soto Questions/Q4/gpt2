To determine the duration of the task of installing 70 tons of rebar for structural concrete elements, we need to calculate the number of units of rebar that will be installed, and then divide that by the production rate of the installation crew.

First, we need to convert the weight of the rebar (70 tons) to the number of units. We can assume that 1 ton of rebar is equal to 2000 pounds. So, 70 tons of rebar is equal to 140,000 pounds. Then, we can assume that 1 unit of rebar is equal to 20 pounds. So, 140,000 pounds of rebar is equal to 7000 units.

Next, we divide the number of units by the production rate of the installation crew. The production rate of the installation crew is 6.2 units per day. So, to install 7000 units of rebar, the duration of the task will be

Duration = 7000 units / 6.2 units per day = 1125.8 days

So, I would recommend to the project manager to include a duration of around 1126 days (1125.8 rounded up) in the bid for this task.
It is important to consider that this is a rough estimate, and other factors such as weather, site conditions, and local labor laws may affect the duration of the task.
