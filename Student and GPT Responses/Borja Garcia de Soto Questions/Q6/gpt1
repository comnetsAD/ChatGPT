If 4 painters work on the painting task instead of 1 painter, the duration of the task will likely be reduced. The effort required to complete the task will also be reduced.

The duration of the task with 4 painters working would be less than 4 days, as the work will be divided among 4 painters, allowing them to complete the task in less time. However, it is difficult to estimate the exact duration without more information about the specific task and the productivity of the 4 painters.

The effort required to complete the task will also be reduced, as 4 painters will be able to work simultaneously on different parts of the task. This will allow them to work more efficiently and complete the task in less time than if only 1 painter were working.

It is worth mentioning that this calculation is based on the assumption that all painters are equally skilled and the work area is big enough to accommodate all the painters working simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. Additionally, proper coordination and supervision of the workers will be important to ensure that the work is completed efficiently and effectively.
