If 4 painters work on the painting task that has an estimated duration of 4 work days with only 1 painter working, the duration of the task will most likely be reduced. However, it is difficult to determine the exact duration without more information about the scope of the task and the efficiency of the painters.

In general, when multiple workers are added to a task, the duration can be reduced because more work can be done simultaneously. However, the actual reduction in duration will depend on the specific task and the efficiency of the workers.

Regarding the effort of the task, it will increase because 4 workers will be required to manage and coordinate.

Please note that this is a general assumption and the actual reduction in duration will depend on various factors such as the size of the task, the skill of the painters, and the availability of the necessary equipment and materials. It is important to have accurate and detailed information about the task in order to make more accurate estimations about the duration and effort of the task.
