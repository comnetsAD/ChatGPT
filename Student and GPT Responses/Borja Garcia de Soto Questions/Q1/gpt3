To calculate the EAC (Estimate At Completion) if the variations experienced so far are not expected to happen again, we can use the following formula:

EAC = (Original Budget) / (Percent Complete) * 100

In this case, the original budget is $1,500 and the percent complete is 40%. Plugging these values into the formula:

EAC = ($1,500) / (40%) * 100

EAC = $3,750

This means that if the variations experienced so far are not expected to happen again, the total cost of the HVAC installation project is expected to be $3,750. This is significantly higher than the original budget of $1,500 and the actual costs to date of $900.
