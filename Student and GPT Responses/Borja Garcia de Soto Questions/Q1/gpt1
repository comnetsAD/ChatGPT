The EAC (Estimate at Completion) is a prediction of the total cost of the project when it is completed, based on the current status of the project and any known variations from the original plan.

To calculate the EAC if the variations experienced so far are not expected to happen again, you can use the following formula:
EAC = (Original budget) / (Percentage of work completed) x (Actual costs to date)

Plugging in the values from your question:
EAC = (1,500) / (40%) x (900) = 1,500 / .4 x 900 = 3,750

So, the EAC for this project if the variations experienced so far are not expected to happen again is $3,750. This means that if no more variations occur, the project is expected to cost $3,750 in total.
