According to the problem statement, the “are not expected to happen again”. Therefore, we should use the EAC method that accepts the actual project performance to date (whether favorable or unfavorable) as represented by the actual using this equation: EAC = AC + BAC – EV
BAC = 1500
EV = (1500 X 40%) = 600
AC = 900
EAC = 900 + 1500 – 600 = 1800
