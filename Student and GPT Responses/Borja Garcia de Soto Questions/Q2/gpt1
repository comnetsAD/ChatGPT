For a project like the construction of a hotel on Yas Island, where the owner is very interested in having the hotel ready on time and full occupancy is expected, the most appropriate resource management technique to use would be Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM).

The main characteristics of CCPM are:
It focuses on managing the resources (people, equipment, materials) needed to complete the project, rather than just managing the schedule.
It uses a "buffer" to account for uncertainty and potential delays in the project, rather than relying on "contingency" time built into the schedule.
It prioritizes the most critical tasks and resources to ensure that the project stays on track and finishes on time.

One of the main advantages of CCPM is that it helps to optimize the resources of the project by identifying the critical path and ensuring that resources are allocated to the most important tasks. This is especially important in a project like the construction of a hotel, where it is crucial to meet the deadline in order to be ready for the start of the tourist season.

Additionally, CCPM also helps to mitigate the potential risks of delays by using buffers to account for uncertainty. This can help to ensure that the project finishes on time, even if there are unexpected delays or issues that arise.

Overall, the use of CCPM in this project will help to optimize the resources and ensure that the hotel is ready on time for the start of the tourist season, which is the main objective of the project.
