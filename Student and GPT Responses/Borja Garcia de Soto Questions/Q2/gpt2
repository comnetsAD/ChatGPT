The most appropriate resource management technique for this project would be "Critical Path Method" (CPM).

CPM is a method used to plan, schedule, and control a project, it helps to identify the critical path and the critical activities, which are the activities that if delayed, will cause the project to be delayed. It also helps to determine the float time for non-critical activities. With CPM, it is possible to optimize the resources of the project by focusing on the critical path and ensuring that the necessary resources are available when they are needed.

CPM is particularly well-suited for this project because it allows for the identification of the most critical tasks and activities, which can then be given priority in terms of resources and schedule. With the owner's emphasis on on-time completion, CPM can help identify and mitigate any potential delays that could occur and optimize the use of resources to ensure that the project is completed on schedule. Additionally, CPM's ability to determine the float time for non-critical activities can help prioritize resources and ensures that the project is completed on time with minimal delay.

In conclusion, the use of CPM in this project can optimize the use of resources and help ensure that the project is completed on time, which is crucial for the success of the project given the owner's interests and the expected full occupancy during the tourist season.
