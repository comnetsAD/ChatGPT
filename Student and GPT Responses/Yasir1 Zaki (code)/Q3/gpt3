Then tell the user if his guess was right or wrong. Finally, change the printing of the dice to print the word rather that the number (e.g.: six)


import random

# create a list of words corresponding to the numbers on a dice
words = ["zero", "one", "two", "three", "four", "five", "six"]

# prompt the user to guess the outcome of the dice roll
guess = int(input("Guess the outcome of the dice roll (0-6): "))

# roll the dice
result = random.randint(0, 6)

# print the outcome of the dice roll
print("*---*")
print("| {} |".format(result))
print("*---*")

# tell the user if their guess was correct or not
message = "Your guess was correct!" if guess == result else "Your guess was wrong. The correct answer was {}.".format(words[result])
print(message)
