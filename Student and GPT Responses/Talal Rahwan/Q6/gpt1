Function templates in C++ provide the advantage of genericity, allowing the same function to work with multiple data types without the need for explicit function overloading or type casting. This means that a single function template can be used to operate on a wide range of data types, making the code more reusable and reducing the amount of code that needs to be written. Additionally, function templates allow for more efficient code execution as the compiler generates a specialized version of the function for each data type used, at compile time. This eliminates the overhead of runtime type checking and type casting.
