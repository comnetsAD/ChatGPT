The output of this code would be 280, assuming that the "cout" statement is properly included in the main function and that the program is able to access the "EXIT_SUCCESS" macro. The program defines a base class "employee" with private member variables "salary" and "workHours" and public member functions "employee" and "getSalary". The constructor for the "employee" class initializes the member variables with the values passed in as arguments. The "getSalary" function for the "employee" class simply returns the value of the "salary" member variable. The "accountant" class is a derived class of "employee" and it has its own implementation of the "getSalary" member function. The "accountant" class constructor calls the "employee" class constructor, passing in 0 for the salary and the value passed in for the work hours. The "getSalary" function of "accountant" class will calculates the salary as 7*workhours and returns the value of salary.
