The output of the code will be 280, assuming that the code is written correctly and the "cout" statement is using the correct syntax for printing to the console. The accountant class is derived from the employee class and it inherits all the members of the employee class. The accountant class has its own getSalary() method which overwrites the getSalary() method of the employee class. In this getSalary() method, it calculates the salary based on the work hours (workHours * 7) and returns it. The main function creates an instance of the accountant class and calls the getSalary() method which returns 280 (40 * 7).
