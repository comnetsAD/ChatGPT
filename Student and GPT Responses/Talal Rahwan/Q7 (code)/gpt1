The output of the code will be "280" (assuming that the cout statement is using the std namespace). The accountant class is derived from the employee class and inherits its member variables and methods. The accountant class constructor initializes the workHours variable of the base class with the argument passed to it, and the getSalary() method of the accountant class calculates the salary by multiplying the workHours by 7 and returns the result. When the acc.getSalary() is called in main, it will return the value of the salary which is workHours * 7 = 40*7 = 280.
