Dynamic size: Linked Lists are dynamic data structures, which means that their size can change during runtime. This means that memory allocation can happen as the program runs, making it more efficient for programs that need to frequently add or remove elements.

Efficient insertions and deletions: Linked Lists are much more efficient at inserting and deleting elements from the middle of the list, as it only requires changing the pointers of the surrounding elements, while arrays require shifting all elements after the insertion or deletion point.
