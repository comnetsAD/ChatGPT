A port is a logical connection that is used by services and programs to exchange information, it determines the specific
program or service that is going to be used. Its values range from 0 to 65535. Some of the common port numbers are 80,
443 - Web pages (HTTP, HTTPS), 21 FTP (File Transfer Protocol), and 25 - email (SMTP). Port numbers are always
associated with an IP address, they work together to exchange data.
Everything connected directly or indirectly to the internet has an IP address (e.g. computers, phones, servers, etc.) Servers
are computers directly connected to the internet and every internet server has an Internet Protocol (IP) address. Unlike
servers, the computers you and I use are called clients, they are connected indirectly to the internet through an internet
service provider (ISP)
