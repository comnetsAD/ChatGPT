The ARP is a component of the next layer – the internetwork layer. This is where the IP addresses play
the most important role, and where the data travels in packets from one address to the next. IP addresses
are very efficient aids to transportation. While the host name shows the user-readable version of the
device’s name, the host IP address gives information on the location to which the data must be routed.
The succeeding layer is the transport layer that serves as an assurance of an effective transportation
system. The protocols that come into play here include TCP and UDP, where the former ensures quality
of the data and the latter ensures that the data gets delivered in real time, although at the slight expense
of high quality. The topmost layer is the Application layer which sends the host device data on the
webpage, email, etc that needs to be accessed. A significant Application layer protocol is the Hypertext
Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It is the foundation of the World Wide Web. In this example, too, HTTP
plays an important role in accessing www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com.
In the example, the process begins with the user entering the Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the
browser from the host device. The URL is a human-readable address that needs to be translated into a
machine-readable IP address so that the webpage can be accessed. The browser retrieves the required
IP address from the Domain Name System (DNS). In this case, the DNS’s IP address is 8.8.8.8, which
corresponds to Google’s DNS (implying that the browser being used is Google). Every application that
uses the Internet to operate receives a port number that facilitates communication. Since the HTTP
protocol is used in this case, the port number is 80, and the web server expects to receive requests from
the client via this port. The browser makes a TCP connection to www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com’s IP
address via port number 80 and communicates information on itself, the requested data and more. This
information is sent via the router that adds its public IP address to the request and sends it as a data
packet to the server.
