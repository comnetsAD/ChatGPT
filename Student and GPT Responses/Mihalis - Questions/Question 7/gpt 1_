It is difficult to compare the danger of cyber-attacks versus physical attacks as they both have unique risks and impacts. However, it is clear that cyber-attacks are becoming increasingly prevalent and dangerous. According to data from the Cyber Threat Alliance, the number of cyber-attacks has been steadily increasing over the past few years, with a significant increase in the number of ransomware attacks. In addition, the cost of cyber-attacks is also on the rise, with a projected cost of $11.5 billion by 2019, according to a report from Cybersecurity Ventures.
The solutions available for protecting the cyber-world from these attacks are effective to some extent, but they are not foolproof. Regular backups, keeping software up to date, and educating employees about the dangers of phishing emails are some examples of solutions that can help protect against cyber-attacks. However, attackers are constantly finding new ways to bypass these solutions, making it difficult to fully protect against cyber-attacks.
In terms of cyber warfare, a scenario could involve a nation-state launching a cyber-attack on another nation's critical infrastructure, such as power plants or transportation systems. This could cause widespread disruption and potentially even loss of life. Additionally, it could also be used to steal sensitive information, disrupt communication systems and damage national security.
The timeframe for a cyberwar is difficult to predict as it depends on many factors such as the development of new technologies and the political tensions between nations. However, as the number of cyber-attacks is increasing, it is likely that a cyberwar will happen within the next decade. It is important for governments and organizations to be prepared and take proactive measures to prevent and mitigate the effects of cyberwarfare.
