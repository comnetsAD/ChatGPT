Whilst considering which type of attacks cause more
damage, physical or cyber, I believe that the main factor of
consideration should be the ease of access. While it might be
troublesome for an attacker to surpass certain security measures,
however, if he/she does not need to be physically at the site of
the attack to conduct it, and the access can be gained remotely,
then this presents a huge advantage for him/her. Of course, this
is not applicable to all the attacks, since some of them would
require some physical steps as in the case of Stuxnet where there
was a need to overcome the “air gap” between the nuclear
facility and the rest of the world, but if there a possibility to
conduct an attack fully remotely, then the attacker has a relative
advantage as there is no distance between him and his target.
There have been numerous instances of relatively
destructive cyber-attacks in the past: Stuxnet, which attacked the
Iranian Natanz Nuclear Facility, Wiper malware that was used
to erase hard drives of Iranian Oil Companies, Shamoon virus
that was used to tackle Saudi Aramco and Qatar’s RasGas oil
companies, etc. Those attacks were orchestrated with direct
objectives to either destroy or damage specific data or objects
and the level of sophistication and damages produced by such
attacks are only going to increase in future. It would have been
significantly harder to tackle all those targets by solely physical
means since scalability would be an issue in some of the
mentioned attacks. For instance, it would have been close to
impossible to physically breach the security in all 30,000 Saudi
Aramco gas stations and erase and overwrite the hard drives in
each and every one of them, and the same applies to Wiper too.
We do think that the existing solutions are doing a great job
of protecting the systems in the current context, given the
existing threats. However, as the share of the IoT industry in our
world increases and its integration into our daily lives (smart
fridges, kettles, climate control systems, HVAC, heating and
water systems) so does the probability of greater and more
severe breaches in security to occur, which can potentially bring
devastating consequences. For instance, if somebody gains
access to the heating system of a house, he/she might potentially
set it on fire if the wrong settings are applied. To combat this,
manufacturers would need to employ even better security
practices, and enhance testing and research, and development in
the after-mentioned areas.
