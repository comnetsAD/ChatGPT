A. Are cyber-attacks more or less dangerous than
physical attacks and how?
Cyber threats are much more dangerous than ever, and
attacks can now cause electrical blackouts, military
equipment failure, or even breaches of national secrets.
Cyber-attacks, with their frequency today, create a
huge concern; cybercrime rates are off the charts and
increasing exponentially. According to the FBI’s annual
look at phishing, scam, and personal data breach, US
victims lost more than $6.9 Billion to internet-Enabled
Crimes only in 2021. Stealing confidential data could
result in serious harm to individuals and nations as a
whole. Common data breaches can steal sensitive data like
medical records—bank account credentials, passwords,
addresses, or emails that put victims at risk of identity
theft. According to FTC (Federal Trade Commission), the
number of consumer identity theft complaints in the US
increased to just over 1.43 million in 2021 compared to
1.39 million complaints in 2020 with credit card fraud is
the second most common form of identity theft with
390,000 complains after Government documents or
benefits fraud with around 400,000 complains.
Cyber-attacks also cause property damage. For example,
in 2008, a massive oil pipeline explosion in Refahiye,
Turkey, is believed to be caused by a cyber-attack.
Another similar case occurred in 2021 when the US
Colonial Pipeline experienced a ransomware attack that
caused it to shut down for several days, causing many
petrol stations and commercial airlines to experience fuel
shortages.
In 2010 Iran witnessed a one-of-a-kind worm called the
Stuxnet. This worm had four zero-day vulnerabilities
configured to attack a specific Siemens device,
specifically the Siemens S7 programmable logic
controller. This device was used in the Iranian nuclear
plant and caused the devices to malfunction and work
abnormally, which severely crippled Iran’s nuclear
program. To date, no one is sure which country created this
worm, which shows the anonymity of cyber attacks. These
are just a couple of the attacks that show the power of
cyber weapons.
B. Are solutions available effective in protecting the
cyber-world from these attacks?
Cyber security is critical today and plays a major role in
keeping countries safe. However, no matter how high the
level of security is, there will always be vulnerabilities that
have not been exploited yet. There are many tools created
to protect users against various “Known” types of worms.
However, it is impossible to achieve 100% security as new
vulnerabilities
are
discovered
daily,
inspiring
cybercriminals to develop malware that exploits these
vulnerabilities. On the other hand, firewalls and other
discussed tools can be used to reduce the impact of an
attack. Moreover, small businesses can depend on other
specialist organizations like GitHub to defend their
systems against attacks.
C. How cyber-threats can be used in cyber warfare
Many cyber weapons could be used to attack nations, and
if effectively combined, they might have an effect more
remarkable than a nuclear weapon. There are seven types
of cyber warfare attacks: Espionage, Sabotage, DoS attack,
Electrical power grid attack, Propaganda attack, Economic
disruption, and surprise attacks. Espionage refers to
tracking countries to obtain their secrets. This can involve
spear phishing attacks to compromise the target’s system
before extracting the information.
Countries can combine attacks for a more significant
effect; for example, a country can use espionage to obtain
information about the transportation control system and
via insider attack, they can cause accidents between trains
or disable train signals causing pedestrians to falsely think
that it is safe to pass the train trail. Countries can also
launch attacks on nuclear facilities of other countries that
may be life threatening.
