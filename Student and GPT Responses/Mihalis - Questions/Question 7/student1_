Comparing physical and cyber-attacks in terms of how dan-
gerous they are is quite tricky, as the word ”dangerous” in this
context is vague. It is easy to estimate the immediate damage
of physical attacks, but cyber attacks are different - their
consequences may last for a long time and have an indirect
effect on many circumstances. During the Second World War,
the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki were nuked, causing
roughly 110,000 immediate deaths and many more afterward.
Of course, there has been no precedent of a cyber attack
causing so much death and destruction. In the same war, Alan
Turing was able to crack the Germans’ encryption system. This
played a role in the US’s victory in WW2 because it gave the
US many advantages when it entered the war. However, it’s
not possible to quantify how much damage this knowledge
caused to Germans. Today, if other countries tried to attack
USA’s critical infrastructures, they would most likely not be
able to cause much damage (compared to mass destruction
weapons). Still, although there’s no precedent of a cyber
attack causing mass destruction, we cannot say that such a
thing is impossible. Literature highlights that countries
are planting cyber weapons in their enemies’ territories so that
they can activate them in case of conflict. Because of this,
destructive cyber weapons might exist that we do not know
of yet. For example, Stuxnet was able to negatively affect the
production of nuclear energy in Iran, but there might be a
possibility of a similar worm being able to cause an incident
like Chornobyl.
However, if we compare physical and cyber attacks outside
physical warfare, we can say that cyber attacks are more
dangerous. Cyber attacks can be used politically, for example,
launching a DDoS attack and shutting down websites that
promote different political opinions. As we saw in the previous
section, a cyber attack may cost a company millions of dollars
of damage. With devices/computers/networks, we cannot say
that 100% security has been achieved. There always will be
ways for attackers to find vulnerabilities.
The main solutions against spreading malware include user
education and regularly updating software. However, there
will probably always be vulnerabilities in software - zero-day
exploits - that we can do nothing about until it gets fixed. Also,
there will always be lazy people that do not make enough effort
for security.
As we discussed, physical and cyber-attacks have advan-
tages and disadvantages against each other in different aspects.
Because of this, during actual warfare, a combination of both
is used. For example, when Russia invaded Georgia in 2008,
it also launched DDoS attacks on the Georgian government’s
websites and independent media to make it harder for the
government to communicate with the people. Estonia’s
national networks were similarly attacked by Russia in 2007.
Cyber attacks can also be used for gathering valuable
information about enemies during warfare. Alan Turing’s
cracking of the German cipher can be considered one such
case.
Thus, we can see that the most dangerous attack is the one
that combines a physical and a cyber one.
