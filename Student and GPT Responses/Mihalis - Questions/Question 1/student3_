Whenever a user tries to access a website - he types its address in the browser, as in gmail.com or wikipedia.org. But, on
the internet, the IP addresses are the ones that are actually being used. Host IP addresses are essentially the IP addresses
translated into words, they enable the users to easily access the website without the need of typing in the actual IP address
every time. The browser does that translation internally, using the domain name system (DNS). We can think of DNS
servers as routers that send packages of information or a dictionary that links hostnames to the IP addresses. DNS servers
respond to questions from clients (users). Clients give the website name (the hostname) and DNS finds a corresponding IP
address for that website. So the first step in connecting to www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com would be the retrieval of the IP
address from the DNS.
