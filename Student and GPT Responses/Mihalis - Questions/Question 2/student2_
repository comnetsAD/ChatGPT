A MAC address or (media access control) address is a unique identifier assigned to a (NIC) network interface controller for use as a network address to uniquely identify a device on the network. MAC is also essential component required for network protocols like TCP/IP to function which is the most optimal protocol used in this case as TCP/IP protocol makes sure that the packages have reached the destination.
All devices communicate only through MAC, when the computer wants to establish a connection with www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com, The PC finds the IP of the website (8.8.8.8)  then checks the local routing table, and finds the router to send the request, in this case ( the router with IP 192.168.1.1). The PC puts the IP (8.8.8.8)  as the destination in the packet and sends it to the router. It finds the Mac of the gateway using ARP (address resolution protocol) and sends the packet to the switch it is connected to, which then checks the routing table with MAC IDâ€™s which indicates the port via which the packet has to be forwarded based on the destination MAC.
To send this data packet to the destination, switches have a routing table which they make by learning MAC from ARP and sending BPDU ( Bridge protocol data unit ) between neighbouring switches. Hence the packet reaches the gateway, which does the same thing to route the packet to next hop using its MAC.
