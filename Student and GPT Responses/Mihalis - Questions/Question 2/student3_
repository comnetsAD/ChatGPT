Every device in a particular network
also has its own unique Media Access Control address that helps in the establishment of physical
connections between devices within a particular network and it provides physical identifiers of a
particular device. MAC addresses are 48-bit addresses (in this example, the MAC address is
8a:00:12:3e:d6:eb) and it remains unique, while IP addresses are recycled as and when devices connect
and disconnect. When a data package for a device in the LAN arrives at the default gateway (in this
case, 192.168.1.1), an Address Resolution Protocol matches the IP address with a MAC address. In this
way, MAC addresses help in communication.
