All the devices in your (wireless) network have MAC addresses. MAC stands for Media Access Control, and it identifies
which device is which on your local network. When data arrives at your router, it has to decide where to forward it. The
router keeps track of all the devices’ MAC addresses in your network. It then assigns a private IP address to a device
(which usually starts with 192.168). This IP address is different from the public IP address of your entire network that
everyone on the internet sees. The router attaches a private IP address to the data packets that you receive from the
internet in order to ensure proper delivery to your device. Even though public and private IP addresses stay the same, the
MAC addresses on data packets are constantly being changed. The packets tell the data where it’s supposed to go next.
Once the data reaches the next device, the MAC address changes once again in order to it to tell where it’s going next.
Many devices have MAC addresses hard-coded in their firmware (i.e they stay the same). This is helpful when for
instance one needs to spot a malfunctioning device, as they can locate it using the MAC address. Another way to use
MAC addresses is to list devices that you approve to connect to your network. In this way, even if one were to steal your
WiFi password, or even connect to your network physically, they wouldn’t be able to utilize it, since only the devices
having the approved MAC addresses can do so. ISPs also use MAC addresses to identify the devices that they provide
with the internet connection, and they can also use them to block the connection.
The browser keeps track of outbound requests so when one clicks a link online, it sends the data to the router, and attaches
the correct private IP address to the data packets sent, ensuring that they arrive at the correct destination. All the private
IPs correspond to their MAC addresses, and the computer needs both
