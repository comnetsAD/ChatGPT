Shodan doesn’t just “port-scan” anymore, simply by searching for “webcams” you get hundreds of thousands of results with some of them displayed with a preview from the camera which raises ethical and legal concerns as people’s privacy is being violated. Moreover, deeper search results on specific devices reveal information that is not related to just port scanning, for example, if you search for “in-tank inventory” you get thousands of results of devices used in fuel pump stations with details about the fuel tanks, their temperature, water level, and more. Moreover, obtaining a screenshot of the login page of the organizations systems is not possible through port scanning which raises suspicions on possible different ways Shodan obtain its information. And displaying such detailed information is not really going to be useful for research purposes but would rather be of a great benefit to hackers or potential attackers.
All these details are displayed on the information page of that particular device that might oppose the main purpose of Shodan.
