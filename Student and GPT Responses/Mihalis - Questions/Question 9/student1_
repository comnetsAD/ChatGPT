Shodan is a publicly available tool. Any vulnerable device
indexed by Shodan can be found by a malicious actor. As
we saw in the previous sections, the information found on
Shodan can be used to bring much harm not only to devices
but to human lives as well. This raises ethical and legal issues.
Should such a tool be available to everyone?
First of all, Shodan, after all, is a port scanner. In the US, for
example, port scanning is a legal activity. This is because
it is a tool that can be used both legally and illegally and both
ethically and unethically. For example, searching devices on
Shodan for research purposes is completely ethical and legal
- it has a good cause. However, establishing any unauthorized
access to the devices found on Shodan is unethical and illegal
in many countries. Therefore, as long as we stay in the
interface of Shodan and do not connect to the IP addresses
found there, we will be staying within the bounds of ethics.
There are several reasons why the use of Shodan should be
allowed:
1) As already discussed, Shodan has limitations against
users that may be malicious. These limitations make sure
that those users are unable to extensively use Shodan
without giving away their identities.
2) Although Shodan can be used maliciously, as already
discussed, it also allows the owners of the devices to
identify those vulnerabilities and fix them. Thus, it just
accelerates the process of fixing/exploiting vulnerabili-
ties. Even without Shodan and similar tools, the mali-
cious actors would still be able to find vulnerabilities
with tools such as Nmap. However, Shodan makes the
process much easier, which means that device owners
can better identify vulnerabilities in their devices. In
this sense, banning Shodan would just hide an issue in
security, not fix it.
3) Shodan offers a great way for researchers, penetration
testers, and security professionals to analyze the internet
and better protect it
