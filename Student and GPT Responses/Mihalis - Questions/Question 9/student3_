While currently Shodan is not considered an illegal tool in
many countries, including the US, there are still many questions
and doubts regarding whether it is safe to allow such tools to
exist and be accessed by unidentified users freely. There are
various arguments that can be constructed, and we will cover
some of them.
One can argue that free access to information is a
fundamental right and since Shodan falls under the category of
an information source, it should be treated as any other source
and should not receive any unnecessary censorship. However,
hindering or restricting access to information may be justified
by governments that consider the information presented as a
threat to national security or the security of private firms and
other parties operating in the country.
At the same time, free access to information is beneficial too,
as it enables individuals and organizations to gain and deepen
their knowledge about the importance of cyber security.
Numerous contributions to the cyber security sphere that can
potentially be produced due to the use of Shodan-like tools
should not be disregarded, in spite of all the possible dangers
that come with it.
