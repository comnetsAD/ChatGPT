Encrypting ransomware attacks are some of the most
widespread cyber attacks.
There are many ways of delivering ransomware to the
victims’ computers. Most of the delivery methods described in
the first section can be used: worms can be used for installing
ransomware; semantic attacks can be used for tricking the
victim into downloading the ransomware by themselves; the
program can also be delivered physically, with a USB drive,
for example.
After installation, the ransomware program encrypts certain
types of files. The files essential for the computer’s operation
are avoided. Some of the most frequently encrypted files
include PDF, Word, PowerPoint, and TXT files. Mostly, these
files have huge importance for the victims, and the only way
for them to get the files back is to pay the ransom. Because the
files are encrypted and the attacker is the only one who knows
the key, there is no other way around it. Bitcoin is mostly used
as a payment method for ransom because of its anonymity. To
further protect their anonymity, the attackers mostly use many
bitcoin addresses.
Ransomware attacks can have different outcomes:
• The victim decides to give up the data and doesn’t pay
the ransom.
• The victim pays the ransom. In this case, the users can
recover their data but not fully.
• If the victim is a company and doesn’t pay the ransom,
the attackers may release its data to the public.
Ransomware attacks can have a huge impact on companies.
The ransom they have to pay to recover their data can range
from hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars. Other
than that, because of the lost data, their operations are delayed
which also can cost them money.
Using ransomware is quite attractive to cyber criminals
because of several reasons:
• Easily spread just like most other malware - there are
many ways of delivering ransomware.
• Can be automated - after infection, the attackers don’t
have to do much.
• Preservation of anonymity - technologies such as Bitcoin
allow attackers to receive money without being discov-
ered.
• High monetary gain - companies are willing to pay huge
sums of money to get their data back

Using data provided by SonicWall Capture Labs in
the ”2022 SonicWall Cyber Threat Report”, we see
a massive surge in 2021. One of the explanations
for this is the fact that as many organizations switched to re-
mote work because of the pandemic, their security decreased.
However, ransomware attacks have decreased in 2022. One
of the reasons for this is the massive fall in the prices of
cryptocurrencies. Another explanation offered by the report connects
this fact to the war in Ukraine. One of the
major sources of ransomware attacks is Russia. Because of
this, as Russia started the war, it shifted its whole focus to
Ukraine, which resulted in fewer attacks. Also, because of
the sanctions by many countries, Russian cybercriminals faced
difficulty gathering means for the attacks.
The decrease in the number of ransomware attacks doesn’t
mean that it will be going away. Ransomware attacks are a
great way for cybercriminals to get monetary gain, and the
attacks will probably increase once more as the war ends
and/or cryptocurrencies become more stable.

Average cost of remediation from
ransomware attacks data is gathered from the surveys
conducted by Sophos in the years 2019-2022. One strange
thing here is that the average cost of remediation decreases
from 2020 to 2021. However, this doesn’t mean that the total
costs decrease. Because the number of attacks in 2021 was
much more than in 2020, the total cost will be more in 2021.
However, the reason for the decrease in the average cost of
remediation, is that the companies have
learned more about recovering from data losses. Still, we can
see that the financial losses are tremendous.
From the victim’s side, nothing can be done to counter the
ransomware if it already has encrypted the files. Because of
this, countermeasures against ransomware have to be taken
before it is installed. The main way to do this is to make sure
that the ransomware cannot be delivered to the computer. To
protect against the use of exploits by the attacker, the operating
system and all third-party software have to be frequently
updated. To protect against semantic attacks, the users have
to be educated. Also, malware detection software can be used
for detecting ransomware. However, this also has to be chosen
carefully, as many anti-virus applications can be malicious
themselves. For ransomware specifically, another solution is to
back up all the important data so that it can be easily restored
if it is lost.
One of the most known ransomware is the WannaCry worm.
It targeted Windows machines and used the EternalBlue ex-
ploit for propagation. Although Windows had released patches
for that vulnerability, WannaCry was still able to spread
because many people didn’t update their operating systems.
WannaCry started attacks in May 2017 and accepted pay-
ments in Bitcoin. The author of the ransomware is considered
to be the North Korean government.
Another interesting case is the TeslaCrypt ransomware. Its
attacks started in 2015 and were originally targeting gamers
(”saved games, user profiles, replays of some popular games
like League of Legends, Call of Duty or Minecraft”).
However, TeslaCrypt later got developed into full-fledged
ransomware that encrypted other types of files as well. The
ransom message was displayed on the desktop, and the victims
were given a chance to decrypt one file to trust that their
files would be returned if they paid the ransom. In
2016, however, the developers released the master key, making
TeslaCrypt ineffective.
