One contemporary cyber-threat that has been prevalent in recent years is Ransomware. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key.
The motivation behind using Ransomware is to make money. Attackers often target businesses and organizations as they are more likely to pay the ransom to regain access to their important data. The delivery method for Ransomware can vary, but it is often delivered through phishing emails or through vulnerabilities in software.
Once the Ransomware is on a device, it encrypts the victim's files and displays a message demanding payment in exchange for the decryption key. The results of a Ransomware attack can be devastating for a business or organization as they may lose access to important data and may have to pay the ransom to regain access.
According to data from the Cyber Threat Alliance, there has been a steady increase in the number of Ransomware attacks over the past few years. In 2016, there were around 4,000 Ransomware attacks per quarter, which increased to around 6,000 attacks per quarter in 2017. This data was sourced from the Cyber Threat Alliance's Ransomware Intelligence Report.
The cost of Ransomware attacks can vary depending on the size of the organization and the amount of data that has been encrypted. According to a report from Cybersecurity Ventures, the cost of Ransomware attacks is projected to reach $11.5 billion by 2019. This cost includes the ransom payments, as well as the cost of recovering from the attack.
Solutions against Ransomware include implementing regular backups, keeping software up to date, and educating employees about the dangers of phishing emails. Two examples of Ransomware include WannaCry and Petya. WannaCry was a global Ransomware attack that affected over 200,000 devices in 150 countries in 2017. Petya was another Ransomware attack that affected businesses and organizations worldwide in 2017.
