DDOS BOTNETS
Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks are one of the
most common types of cyber-attacks. The first quarter of 2022
broke all records in terms of DDoS attacks (hitting more than
90,000 attacks, for reference, only 20,000 attacks were
conducted during the same quarter the year prior), and they
accounted for approximately 59% of all the attacks in 2022
according to the Application Protection Report by F5 Labs.
In addition, the strength and size of attacks are steadily
increasing according to the same report. DDoS attacks
undoubtedly present a serious concern to overall web security.
Having those reasons in mind, DDoS attacks were chosen as the
subject of our further discussion.

A botnet is essentially a group of computers infected with
malware that performs commands given by an attacker.
Attackers that employ a such type of cyber threat can have a
specific target in mind, in which case they would direct all the
power towards an individual target, or, as in the case of one of
the biggest DDoS attacks ever recorded - Mirai, the attack can
be dispersed, tackling thousands of devices. Employing such a
“shotgun” sort of approach, it managed to infect more than
600,000 devices, the majority of which were IoT devices, setting
a record at the time. The major goals of the attackers utilizing
botnets include stealing data, sending spam, or undermining
their competitors, etc. Another prominent DDoS attack was
performed in Q1 of 2020 on Amazon Web Services (AWS)
servers. Amazon claimed about the attack in its AWS Shield
Threat Landscape report. A month before that, another
attack of 1.3 Tbps hit Github. Judging from the frequency
of DDoS attacks, we can certainly say that they represent a major
threat in cyberspace nowadays.

DDoS botnet attacks are essentially performed using a
network of bots i.e. computers, servers, IoT devices, and any
other devices that are infected with malicious software (exploit)
and are remotely controlled by an attacker. To accumulate
the network of bots, firstly, one must spread the exploit to
devices. Delivery of the exploit can happen physically (by
injecting an infected USB drive and connecting the destination
system manually by a cable) as well as remotely. The protocols
used by DDoS exploits include FTP, POP3, TCP&UDP.
Botnet sends an enormous flow of traffic to a specific
destination (a server) using all of the accumulated computing
power, creating congestion for the traffic from ordinary web
users trying to access the site. The strength of a DDoS
attack is measured in Tbps (Terabytes per second), i.e., in terms
of the amount of data it transmits to the server in a unit of time.
In the Layer7 type of attack, the strength of a DDoS attack
depends on the size of the pool of IP addresses and on the power
of the servers/devices the attack is being conducted from. In the
Layer4 type of attack, the power can be adjusted when it is
initiated. There is a certain threshold of traffic that can be
sustained by a server and thus, a DDoS attack exceeds that limit
and disrupts the network. An end user trying to access a website
that is under a DDoS attack will experience either a slower
response time for the website in question or its complete outage.
After extensive penetration, the target system would stop
responding and invoke the denial-of-service to the incoming
traffic, and the server will halt.

DDoS attacks incur enormous financial losses for business
owners whose websites are attacked, as they lose revenue while
their websites are down. The competitors of the businesses in
question can benefit from such a disruption in the short run as
the customers who were willing to purchase products or services
from the business entity will now turn to other firms to find
suitable substitutes. Many firms in fact oftentimes utilize
services provided by DDoS hackers.

Businesses may also incur losses in reputation due to the
DDoS attack which in turn might affect them in the long run.
DDoS attacks might undermine the national security of targeted
countries if the attack is performed on a government’s websites
or communication means. This was also briefly mentioned in
one of our readings (DDoS attacks on Estonia and Georgia).
The statistics regarding the DDoS attacks over the time
period from Q4 2020 until Q2 2022 are presented in Figure 1
(Such a time period was chosen due to insufficient data provided
in the reports for the earlier years). The data was taken from
Kaspersky’s Securelist which was compiled using Kaspersky’s
proprietary DDoS Intelligence system. While we can clearly see
the upwardly increasing trend in DDoS detections (up until Q1
2022), we have to bear in mind that the following graph was
solely based on the data from the after-mentioned source, and it
does not represent the entire picture of DDoS detections
worldwide, even though Kaspersky is a reliable source in the
cyber security world. The reports used even mention that DDoS
Intelligence statistics only consider the botnets detected by
Kaspersky and do not include all the DDoS attacks that took
place within a given time period.

As seen from the Kaspersky DDoS Intelligence system,
there has been an upward trend in
DDoS attacks up until Q1 of 2022 when it peaks. There were
about 14% fewer detections observed in Q2 2022 than in the
previous quarter, however, as the report presented by Kaspersky
suggests, the overall situation might actually have worsened as
the quality of the attacks performed is getting increasingly
complex in comparison with previous years. Furthermore, the
report mentions that botnet activity grew and links the increase
in DDoS activity with the decline in the crypto industry as this
commonly boosted DDoS attacks in previous years.

Other data acquired from Cisco Annual Internet Report suggest
the trend presented in DDoS attacks over the period of 2018-2023.
In general, DDoS attacks are still
on the rise, and it seems that they will continue to do so.
In terms of solutions that one might utilize in order to prevent
or ward off an incoming DDoS attack, there are so-called DIY
measures such as manually blacklisting specific IPs, but those
are not that effective and oftentimes are utilized measures after
an attack had been conducted. More advanced approaches can
include utilizing specialized hardware that can filter traffic, this
however incurs huge costs for the host and sometimes is not
available to certain hosts. Another option is using cloud-
based/ISP-provided solutions, which are more beneficial than
the latter, as they facilitate scalability, which is usually a major
issue in the case of hardware solutions. In addition, they are
relatively cheaper in comparison to hardware solutions.

If we were to think about the cost of DDoS attacks, it would
be logical to assume that the average cost of an attack should
increase as its complexity and the level of sophistication
required to bypass the security of a given system. But the price,
however, has dropped significantly over recent years due to a
huge supply of DDoS attackers offering their services to firms
and individuals. Unfortunately, we were not able to find factual
information about the prices of DDoS attacks over the years.
