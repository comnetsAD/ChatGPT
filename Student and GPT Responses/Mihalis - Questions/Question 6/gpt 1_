The contemporary cyber-threat I have chosen is Ransomware.
The motivation behind using Ransomware is to extort money from victims by encrypting their data and demanding payment in exchange for the decryption key. The delivery method is typically through phishing emails or malicious software downloads.
Once the ransomware is downloaded, it encrypts the victim's files and demands payment in the form of cryptocurrency in exchange for the decryption key. The results of a ransomware attack can range from minimal to severe, depending on the amount of data encrypted and the importance of the data to the victim. In some cases, victims may choose to pay the ransom to regain access to their data, while in others, they may choose to restore their data from backups or use decryption tools.
According to data from the Cyber Threat Alliance, the number of ransomware attacks has been steadily increasing over the past several years, with a significant spike in 2016 and 2017. In 2016, there were approximately 4,000 reported ransomware attacks per day, and in 2017, that number had risen to 6,000 per day. The sources used for this information include the Cyber Threat Alliance, the FBI, and cybersecurity companies such as Symantec and McAfee.
The cost of ransomware attacks has also been increasing over time. According to a report by Cybersecurity Ventures, the cost of ransomware attacks is expected to reach $11.5 billion in 2019. This is an increase from the estimated cost of $325 million in 2015. The cost increase can be attributed to the rising number of attacks and the increasing sophistication of the ransomware being used.
Solutions against ransomware include implementing robust backups, educating employees on identifying and avoiding phishing emails, and implementing endpoint protection software. Two examples of ransomware are WannaCry and Petya. WannaCry was responsible for a global ransomware attack in May 2017, affecting more than 200,000 victims in 150 countries. Petya was a ransomware attack that affected several high-profile companies in June 2017, including Ukraine's international airport and metro system, as well as Danish shipping giant Maersk.
