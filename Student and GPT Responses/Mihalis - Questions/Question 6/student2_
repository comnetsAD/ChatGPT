A. Motivation behind DDOS Attacks
DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks are used by
attackers for many reasons like:

Financial gain or economic benefit: Hackers use
DDoS attacks as financial weapons, demanding
Bitcoin through email to stop the attack.

Revenge: DDoS attacks on organizations or
individuals where the dissatisfied individual or
organization behind the attack usually intends to
inflict harm in retaliation for a perceived violation.


Ideological belief: hacktivist groups like anonymous
attack political targets for ideological reasons, such
as opposition to a nation-state or government
policies, or they do not accept their ethics or do not
perceive their actions as ethical.

B. Delievery mothod / How DDOS attacks work
DDoS attacks occur in three stages:

In the first phase, Hackers get access to network-
connected computers. Hackers scan the internet for
computers or Internet of Things devices that can be
compromised using an automated process.

The second phase starts when sufficient numbers of
computers are compromised, and these machines are
called Botnets. Instructions are then sent to these
botnets to launch an attack on a specific network or
organization.

Finally, Hackers direct the army of botnets to attack
a virtual machine that causes the machine to slow
down or may even crash the server. As these attacks
are distributed from many locations, the victim’s
system cannot identify where the attack is initiated
and cannot block the incoming traffic. Moreover, IP
addresses of compromised devices sending requests
to the server can be spoofed, which prevents the
victim from filtering malicious traffic to find the
attack source.

DDoS attacks in general are classified into 3 main categories:
volumetric attack, protocol attack, and resource layer attack.

Volumetric attacks are the most common form of
DDoS attacks where the network layer is
overwhelmed with service requests that may appear
legitimate. DNS amplification is an example of a
volumetric attack where the attacker exploits
vulnerabilities in Domain naming system servers to
amplify small requests to much larger payloads,
which brings down the victim’s servers.

By exploiting vulnerabilities in the layer three and
layer four protocol stack, a protocol attack causes a
service disruption. SYN flood is a good example
where an attacker initiates many connections to the
server without finalizing them, and the server has to
spend much of its resources waiting for unfinalized
open connections to be finalized which causes the
server to be unresponsive to legitimate attacks

A resource layer attack interrupts data transmission
between hosts by targeting web application packets.
Examples of such attacks include SQL injection and
layer seven attacks.

C. Impact of the DDoS on victims
In a DDoS attack, many requests are sent to a server
overwhelmingly, forcing that site or resource to go offline
or reject legitimate requests. Attacks usually target
businesses, and in the event of a successful attack,
businesses are affected in many ways, including making
network resources inaccessible to employees of the
organization, which leads to downtime that prevents
customers from receiving required assistance as they are
unable to reach specialized professionals. Moreover, if a
web server hosts an e-commerce site, no customer would
be able to make purchases, costing the business valuable
clients and significantly impacting the business’s
reputation. A study by Kaspersky Lab showed that one in
five attacks could last for days or weeks. This shows how
big a threat DDoS attacks can be to businesses, as they
can lose up to $20,000 per hour.

D. DDoS attacks over time
According to Cisco in a white paper released as part of the
company’s more extensive report, “Visual Networking Index
Complete Forecast Update, 2015-2020.” The frequency
of DDoS attacks has increased over 2.5 times in the last 3
years (2017 – 2020) where the average size of each attack is
at a constant increase and approaching 1 Gbps; however, this
is outdated as recent research shows that the average attack
in the 3rd quarter of 2021 used 4.31Gbps of data which is
enough to bring down most small to medium-sized websites.
However, this number is much lower than the Q1 2021 metric
of 9.15 Gbps. However, nothing compared to the most
prominent attack launched by the Mirai botnet variant that
peaked at 2.5 Tbps (terabytes per second) according to
Cloudflare, which described it as the most significant attack
in terms of bitrate.
DDoS attacks have been increasing exponentially over the
past few years, and especially during the pandemic that
everyone online in Q2 2022, a significant and long-lasting
spike was witnessed in the number of attacks. Since we are
still using the internet at the same capacity, the net number of
attacks is expected to keep increasing.

Cisco predicts that in 2023 the number the total number
of DDoS attacks will cross 15 million. DDoS attacks are
not just increasing alone, malicious actors are creating an
even bigger army of botnets, increasing the scale of DDoS
attacks. Attacks of 1 Gbps can knock down an
organization’s servers, but now attacks can reach up to
1Tbps generated by millions of infected devices.
As attacks are generated more often with a massive
increase in size, Business losses are increasing
exponentially. Furthermore, since IT services downtime
costs organizations between $300,000 to over $1,000,000
per hour, you can see the impact caused by an attack even
for a short period. Since there are ineffective solutions to
eliminate DDoS attacks, we do not expect to see a decline
in the number of attacks soon.

E. How to prevent a DDoS attack:
One of the most effective ways to reduce the chances of
getting attacked is by creating a Denial of Service
Response Plan. This would take some time to plan as it
depends on the complexity of the organizational
infrastructure. Another method is by using firewalls;
however, as some attacks target firewalls, it is suggested
to put data centers on multiple networks that are not in the
same geographical region and install servers in different
data centers and ensure there is no place where traffic
bottlenecks in the network. DDoS attacks are not new to
the cyber world, and many widespread DDoS attacks are
similar. Using anti-DDoS software or hardware would
help prevent these common types of attacks increasing the
network’s security. Another way is by knowing your
network’s traffic. For example, if an organization
provides services only for a particular region or country,
significant traffic is not expected from other countries.
Hence if an attack is made from a different country, it
would be easily identified and blocked immediately
instead of overwhelming the server and rejecting
legitimate requests .

F. Example of DDoS attacks
The Mirai Botnet: Mirai malware first scanned IP
addresses of devices connected to the internet and
identified IoT devices that run a version of Linux called
ARC. The malware exploits its security vulnerabilities to
gain network access using default passwords. If the
owner/user has not changed the default password, this
intelligent device is added to the list of botnets on
standby, waiting for an order to flood a target with
requests. Over 600,000 devices were infected with Mirai,
which was used to attack the DNS provider and registrar
DYN on October 2016.

The GitHub attack in 2018: This attack is particularly
effective as it uses an amplification factor where the ratio of
the attacker request size to the amount of traffic generated is
up to 51,200 times! Even though GitHub is prepared for
DDoS attacks, its defences were overwhelmed by the
enormous amount of traffic caused by the amplification .
GitHub explained in the company’s incident report: “Over the
past year, we have deployed additional transit to our facilities.
We have more than doubled our transit capacity during that
time, which has allowed us to withstand certain volumetric
attacks without impact to users … Even still, attacks like this
sometimes require the help of partners with larger transit
networks to provide blocking and filtering”.
