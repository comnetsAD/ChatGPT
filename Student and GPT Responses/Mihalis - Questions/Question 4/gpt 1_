Once the host establishes a connection with the website "," the contents of the website eventually reach the client in the following steps:
The host sends a request to the website, using the transport-layer protocol (such as TCP or UDP) and the appropriate port number, asking for the specific web page or resource it wants to access.
The website receives the request and processes it, fetching the requested web page or resource from its server.
The website sends a response to the host, containing the requested web page or resource, along with any associated data or media.
The host receives the response and processes the contents of the web page, displaying it on the client device.
In summary, the contents of the website reach the client by the host sending a request to the website using the transport-layer protocol and the appropriate port number, the website sending a response containing the requested web page or resource, and the host receiving and processing the contents of the web page, displaying it on the client device.
