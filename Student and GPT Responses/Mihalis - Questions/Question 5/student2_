Cyber attack is a broad term that covers many types of attacks
like Malware attacks, phishing, password attack,
Ransomware, DNS hijacking, Dos and DDoS attacks, and
many more. Each attack aims to fulfill a specific task; for
example, Dos or DdoS attacks are meant to shut down a
machine or network, making it inaccessible to its intended
users. While cybercriminals typically use a malware
attack to extract data they can leverage over victims for
financial gain. Phishing attacks are one of the most
popular types of attacks where an attacker mimics to be a
trusted person and sends fake emails that look typical to an
original email. These emails usually have a link to redirect
the victim to a fake website and enter their log-in credentials,
which get stolen by the attacker. Another attack is called a
Man-in-the-middle attack, also known as an eavesdropping
attack, where an attacker intercepts a connection between two
parties and can view the data sent between them that could be
personal such as bank details or log-in credentials. Likewise,
every attack is designed with a different purpose.
Cyber attacks are not only restricted to software-related
attacks or data theft. There are many types of cyber-physical
attacks, such as Data Injection attacks, where a harmful code
is injected into industrial control systems that cause the
system to operate in a strange way that might result in
physical damage, like the Stuxnet attack in 2010. If a
physical attack is intended for monetary purposes, alternative
cyber approaches reduce the risk of exposure to the public as
much as physical theft. Moreover, victims of cyber attacks
are much larger than a typical physical attack, making it more
profitable to criminals. Furthermore, attackers can use
numerous tools to mask themselves on the internet, making
them harder to be identified. In addition, cyber-attacks are
also used by nations in cyber war to obtain confidential
information or attack organizations such as national nuclear
power plants. Another advantage of cyber attacks over
physical attacks is that attacks can target victims overseas,
which makes it more convenient for criminals.
