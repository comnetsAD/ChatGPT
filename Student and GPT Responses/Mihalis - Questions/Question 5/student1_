Each piece of technology (software or hardware) that people
use can have many vulnerabilities, which, sooner or later, can
be maliciously used to attack individuals, enterprises, or even
governments.
A cyber-attack may consist of multiple steps. A typical cyber-attack consists of:
• Reconnaissance - gathering information and finding vul-
nerabilities in the target computer/network/device.
• Penetration - gaining access.
• Stealing of valuable data or insertion of malware (mali-
cious software) into the target.
• Obfuscation - hiding the traces of the attack.
The first step of almost every cyber attack is gathering some
information. As we use the internet on the daily basis, if
we do not take necessary measures, our sensitive information
becomes exposed to the public and at any point can be used
maliciously against us. For example, many individuals and
even enterprises such as nuclear plants may connect to the
public internet which makes their actions exposed to everyone.
If a person uses an HTTP connection, then his/her connec-
tion will be visible to everyone. Even with HTTPS, there’s a
chance of someone listening to the information. For example,
during the Man-in-the-Middle attack, the attacker spoofs the
certificate and sees the information that is being transferred.
The victim doesn’t see anything suspicious, because the infor-
mation still arrives at the destination.
After finding a technical vulnerability, for example, a zero-
day vulnerability, in some software or hardware, the attackers
can exploit it for getting access. Zero-day vulnerabilities are
vulnerabilities that have recently been discovered and not yet
disclosed or fixed. For example, EternalBlue and EternalRo-
mance vulnerabilities in Windows, after being leaked from
NSA, were used for Trojans such as TrickBot and Emotet.
Also, because of prioritizing profit over security, many
enterprises may use commercial off-the-shelf products instead
of developing their own software/hardware. Because of this, if
vulnerabilities are found in one of those products, the whole
business might be in danger.

Instead of vulnerabilities in software/hardware, the reckless-
ness of the user can be exploited for gaining access to the
target system. For example, the Mirai botnet spread through
thousands of IoT devices all thanks to people having default or
simple passwords that could easily be broken with a dictionary
attack.
For gaining access, social engineering is also used, which
involves the deception and manipulation of the target. In the
case of Stuxnet, there was no way of accessing the nuclear
facilities via the internet, as their networks were isolated.
However, USB devices were used as intermediaries for getting
the worm in the networks. This most likely involved
dropping USB drives in or near the facilities which would then
be picked up by workers and plugged into their computers,
causing them to be infected with Stuxnet.
Social engineering attacks can be defined as
”the manipulation of user-computer inter-
facing with the purpose to breach a computer system’s infor-
mation security through user deception.” These attacks involve
phishing, malvertisement, file or application masquerading,
web pop-ups, and so on. Their goal is to deceive the user
into thinking that what they are opening/downloading is legit.
• Phishing - sending spam emails that trick victims into re-
vealing sensitive information or downloading something.
• File or application masquerading - a file or an application
may appear safe but contain malicious code inside (e.g.
PDF file masquerading).
• Malvertisement - a malicious ad that people think is
legitimate.
• Search engine poisoning - manipulating a search engine
in a way that shows the malicious website among top-
ranked results.
If access to the victim’s computer is gained, malware can
be installed. Malware, defined as malicious software, includes
many types of programs that once installed, can take over
the control of the machine and track the victim’s actions, steal
information, or do something else that will benefit the attacker.
These include:
• Ransomware - the malware that encrypts the files on the
computer and returns them to the victim if a certain sum
of money is paid.
• Information stealers.
• Key-loggers - track what keys the user presses on the
keyboard and sends the data to the attacker.
• Cryptominers - programs that use the victim’s computer’s
computing power for mining cryptocurrencies for the
attacker.
Finally, to conceal malware, different methods are used.
Rootkits can be installed to conceal the program from the
operating system, or other ways can be used (e.g. changing
the process name) for preventing the victim to find out
about the attack.
The compromised computers may also become a part of a
botnet. A botnet is a network of infected computers that can be
instructed to do something. Most commonly, botnets are used
for launching DDoS attacks. A denial of service (DoS) attack
is when many requests are sent to a web server. The server
fails to process them in time, and as new requests come in, it is
unable to respond, which results in people being unable to use
the services provided by the server. A DoS attack originating
from one IP address can be easily blocked by blocking the
address. However, this doesn’t work for DDoS (Distributed
DoS) attacks in which case the requests are coming in from
many different IP addresses. That’s why botnets are perfect
for launching DDoS attacks - it’s hard to tell for the server
whether the bots have malicious intents or not.
DDoS attacks coming from botnets can have a high impact.
The attacks launched by the Mirai botnet were able to shut
down Dyn (a DNS provider) and Valve Steam’s and Playsta-
tion’s servers.
Cyber attacks have some advantages and disadvantages
compared to physical attacks. First of all, if the attacker
seeks destruction and bloodshed, physical attacks will be
more useful. For example,  attacks on critical
infrastructures of the US will most likely not have as high
casualties as weapons of mass destruction will have.
However, cyber attacks offer many advantages:
• Anonymity - during a physical attack, whether we are
talking about theft or an airstrike, it is easy to find out
the identity of the attacker. However, finding the author
of a virus or an operator of a botnet can take a lot of
time.
• Less physical damage - sometimes the attacker’s goal is
to gain profit or just financially damage the victim. For
example, if Israel launched an airstrike on Iran, it would
lead to the death of many innocent civilians.
• Fewer costs - a cyber attack can cost way less than a
physical attack. Again, in the case of Stuxnet, it would
cost Israel more to launch an airstrike than it cost to make
the worm.
• Better scalability: viruses and worms can spread through
tens of thousands of computers in a short period. For
example, computers all around the world were infected
with the WannaCry ransomware, originating from North
Korea.
