The cyber-threat landscape is constantly evolving and can be broken down into several different categories. One of the most common types of cyber-threats is malware, which is software designed to harm or exploit a computer or network. This can include viruses, worms, and trojans, which can infect and spread through a system, causing damage or stealing sensitive information. Another common type of cyber-threat is phishing, which is a tactic used to trick individuals into providing personal information or login credentials.
Another category of cyber-threats includes ransomware, which is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files and demands a ransom payment to restore access. Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are another type of cyber-threat, which are typically used by state-sponsored actors or criminal groups to gain long-term access to a target's network and steal sensitive information.
The motivation behind using cyber-attacks instead of physical attacks can vary depending on the attacker's goals. Some attackers may be motivated by financial gain, such as stealing sensitive information that can be sold on the black market or extorting a ransom payment. Others may be motivated by political or ideological goals, such as attempting to disrupt critical infrastructure or steal sensitive government or military information. Cyber-attacks can also be used to disrupt business operations or damage a company's reputation. Additionally, cyber-attacks can be launched from anywhere in the world, making them a low-risk, high-reward option for attackers.
