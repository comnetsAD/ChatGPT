The cyber-threat landscape is constantly evolving, but some common types of threats include malware, phishing, ransomware, and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. Malware refers to malicious software that can infect a computer or device and allow an attacker to gain access to sensitive information or disrupt operations. Phishing refers to attempts to trick individuals into providing sensitive information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, through fraudulent email or website. Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts a victim's files and demands payment in exchange for the decryption key. DDoS attacks involve overwhelming a website or network with traffic to disrupt service.
The motivation behind using cyber-attacks instead of physical attacks is often the ability to carry out an attack remotely and with a lower risk of being caught. Cyber-attacks can also be more cost-effective and have a greater potential impact than physical attacks. Additionally, many organizations and individuals have valuable information stored electronically, making it a more attractive target for cybercriminals. Additionally, it is also a way for hackers to disrupt services of a company or government without having a physical presence in the location.
