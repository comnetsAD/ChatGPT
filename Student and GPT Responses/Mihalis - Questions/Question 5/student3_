With the rise of the IoT and crypto industries, the
development of AI and machine learning, and frankly, the
inescapable digitalization of every aspect of our lives, the digital
world finds itself in a rather troubling situation. There are
various cyber threats that pose threat to computer systems
nowadays and it does not seem that their number is going to
diminish. Cyber worms, botnets, rootkits and backdoors,
different types of ransomwares, DDoS attacks, spam, and
phishing (especially email phishing), trojans, backdoors, etc. –
all the after-mentioned vulnerabilities pose a tremendous threat
to computer systems. In our readings, we have extensively
covered some infamous examples of such vulnerabilities: the
Stuxnet cyber worm which was used to attack Nantanz nuclear
facility in Iran, the Mirai botnet, which was utilized to
primarily attack IoT devices in targeted regions worldwide,
WannaCry and Petya ransomware (that used EternalBlue and
DoublePulsar exploits) and infected hundreds of thousands of
systems, and many others.
Cybercriminals may utilize various means to attain their
goals, the list of which is quite extensive. There can be numerous
motivations behind cyber threats as they may be performed by
various parties/individuals, such as governments, terrorists,
hacktivists, etc. All of them have their proper objectives, the
majority of which can belong to some of the common groups:
curiosity (most applicable to individual script kiddies),
vandalism, hacktivism, industrial espionage, extortion or fraud,
and information warfare.
Cyber-attacks are intended for those who prefer to act sleek
and stealthy, and thus entities/individuals/governments
oftentimes utilize those instead of straight-on physical attacks to
act more discretely. The motivation to conduct an attack
anonymously is also another factor to bear in mind. In the case
of governments this enables them to perform the attack without
bearing consequences (if its origin remains undetected) or it can
enable them to avoid additional challenges related to
international law. In the case of Stuxnet for instance, where there
was presumably an immediate need for an intervention in Iran's
growing nuclear program, the US and Israel both knew that
military action would destabilize the region and incur
consequences and retaliation from Iran and thus chose to employ
digital means instead.
However, some parties, terrorist groups, for instance, may
employ classical methods of combat. Blowing something off or
any other physical attacks do not require sophistication and
computer skills in most cases. Furthermore, if the primary goal
is to gain attention with an act of some sort, terrorist groups may
still prefer to perform a physical attack simply because it is more
demonstrative. A bombing or a terror attack would certainly
attract much higher attention from both media and the general
public than an infiltration into a network of critical
infrastructure. Although, one may argue that if significant
damage is caused, resulting in say a flood due to a malfunction
in a dam’s control system or any other sort of disaster, this would
certainly attract as much attention as in the latter case.
Infrastructure that can be targeted includes electrical systems
and blackouts; telecommunications services and internet/voice
communication, etc. However, as the readings that we covered
suggest, there has not yet been such a case, as in the majority of
cases, an attacker cannot perform an attack of such complexity.
The complexity of cyberattacks coupled with the low chance of
a successful attack demotivates the terrorists. However, if an
attack on critical infrastructure is successful it might as well
attract as much attention as physical attacks.
Scalability is another parameter that plays a vital role in any
cyber-attack. To scale up a physical attack, would require
bringing additional troops, and military equipment, which can
be extremely troublesome in logistical terms, especially during
a battle. Whereas in the case of cyber-attacks, one might argue
that scalability is relatively simpler, as it implies the deployment
of more computing resources, which can be done quicker than
say shipment of additional equipment to the battlefield. This,
however, does not imply it is easy in all terms.
