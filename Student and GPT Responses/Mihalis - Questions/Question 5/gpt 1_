There are many different types of cyber threats that organizations and individuals may face. Some common types include:
Malware: software designed to harm or exploit a computer system, such as viruses, trojans, and ransomware.
Phishing: social engineering tactics used to trick people into giving away sensitive information, such as login credentials or financial information.
Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks: an attempt to make a website or network resource unavailable by overwhelming it with traffic from multiple sources.
Advanced persistent threats (APTs): a prolonged and targeted cyber attack in which an attacker establishes an unlawful, long-term presence on a network in order to steal sensitive data.
Motivations behind cyber attacks can vary, but often include financial gain, espionage, or political motivations. For example, a cyber criminal may use malware to steal credit card information for financial gain, while a nation-state actor may use APT tactics for espionage. Additionally, physical attacks can be risky and difficult to execute, whereas cyber attacks can be launched from anywhere in the world, making it a popular choice for individuals or groups looking to cause disruption or steal sensitive information.
