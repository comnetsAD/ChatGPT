According to the security survey, in 2021, 91% of industrial
organizations have encountered at least one incident related to
cyber security. As Eddy Wade, principal industrial
consultant at Dragos, a major cybersecurity firm in the Gulf
region says: “Keeping industrial control systems and operational
technology safe means protecting the most important structures
of an organization … Cyberattacks targeting critical industries
such as energy, oil, and gas, mining and pharmaceuticals will
leverage disruption of sometimes dangerous physical equipment
which we rely on as a society.” Formation and maintenance
of rigid and strong cyber security are vital to any industrial firm
nowadays, and it seems that its importance will only increase in
years to come.
As a tool, Shodan has both great advantages and
disadvantages in terms of its possible use cases and scenarios
that it can be incorporated into. Shodan can be used as a security
research and testing tool as it enables users to explore different
vulnerabilities in targeted devices and if used properly and in
goodwill, it can act as a highly beneficial tool for vulnerability
detection and cyber security maintenance. For instance, one
might check his own IP address via Shodan and see what
vulnerabilities are detected, or the Research and Development
team in an IoT firm might run multiple Shodan searches on the
devices that are in development to make alterations and/or
reinforce devices’ security. Naturally, the process can be
repeated, for instance, to make sure that the devices are not
prone to new vulnerabilities that have originated after the latest
firmware update and that there are no flaws left. Such a use case
opens a great possibility for IoT device manufacturers to test
their devices and facilitate research and development. In turn,
this will have economic benefits since expenses on R&D will
noticeably decrease. Having an extensive list of filters,
manufacturers and individual users can identify potential threats
to security and track exploits with the help of Shodan.
Conversely, Shodan can be used in malicious ways.
Individuals can look for under-protected devices and exploit the
vulnerabilities that those have. In the case of unprotected CCTV
cameras, they can use them to analyze security breaches or
weaknesses and access the premises of a secured object, facility,
private property, or any other place. In the case of ICS, they may
halt the ongoing processes resulting in production delays for
private companies (which will incur financial and reputational
losses), and the breakdown of critical infrastructure elements
which by itself creates numerous negative implications. They
may also disturb the ground and air traffic regulations if the
according systems are accessed, and this could certainly produce
devastating consequences (aircraft and automotive accidents).
Corporate networks can also get disrupted, which in turn would
cease normal workflow and communications within a firm or a
conglomerate if we are talking about an attack on a large-scale
entity. Logically, this would result in financial, reputational,
time, and many other losses for the stakeholder in question. It
can affect the stock prices of the company and its long-term
stability in the market.
While it may appear that Shodan is an all-powerful utility
that can tackle various devices, we believe that it is not as serious
as it may initially appear. While it provides some meaningful
assistance to attackers employing this tool, it primarily serves
the role of the detection device. It does not directly participate
in the orchestration of a malicious attack, but rather, provides a
solid informational foundation regarding the target that is to be
attacked. Relative to the exploits, botnets, cyber worms, and
many other cyber threats that have been covered so far, Shodan
does not present an immediate threat to the devices in question.
Furthermore, it is worth considering that Shodan is not
considered illegal, as it simply provides a way to scan ports of
the devices that are connected to the internet, unlike the after-
mentioned cyber threats and other tools that are available in
DarkWeb for instance. It is the unethical use case that makes it
seem like the source of the issue, however, one can use his or
her knowledge of chemistry to fabricate DIY explosives or to
synthesize aromatic compounds for fragrances. In both cases,
the freely available tools and knowledge can lead to different
end products, thus it is valid to say that it is the intent rather than
the tool that presents a danger.
