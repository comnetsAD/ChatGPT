Shodan is a search engine that other than displaying websites, it reveals information about any device connected to the internet. According to Shodan, it is the first world’s search engine for internet-connected devices. At first sight, we might think that it is a very precious tool for hackers but in fact it is of no use as hackers use other more advanced tools to attack internet connected devices. Even though Shodan does not contribute much to the hacker’s world, it reveals how vulnerable IoT devices are and how anyone without deep knowledge can be able to gain access to a webcam, sensors or any device with minimal security. One of the most powerful functions of shodan is how it exposes the location of any device connected to the internet. This has caused big tech companies to consider taking extra measures to protect their IoT devices. There are various ways to achieve a higher level of security with the easiest one of them simply changing the default password that would make it challenging for hackers to gain access to these devices as it would be as hard as hacking a server.  Another way is by enabling multi-factor authentication with user’s IoT devices that would make it harder for hackers/ attackers to gain access without having access to the second authentication device.

Hackers can use shodan to hack into devices by simply searching for devices with default passwords and obtain their open ports. The hacker can then search the default password for that device and can then login the system and cause damage, steal information or control the device. Most Iot devices password is not changed from their default password which makes them much easier to hack. Gaining access to a huge number of IoT devices can also trigger the development of DDoS army of botnets by creating a malware targeted to infect these vulnerable IoT devices. And as shodan shows the vulnerabilities of these devices, a tailored malware can be developed easier as much information is gathered to determine the best vulnerability to access to infect the greatest number of devices.

On the other hand, shodan is an effective tool for defenders in many ways. Shodan can be used to discover devices with vulnerabilities or unnecessary open ports and fix this issue. Shodan is also used for research purposes as security specialists can use these tools along with their equipment to discover and rectify vulnerabilities. Moreover, it can be used to spread awareness to the public and show how vulnerable their unprotected devices are and the risks it imposes on their privacy and security.  There are various ways that could be used to increase the security of Iot devices that include setting a new password to these devices that would make it harder to break into. Companies should also be aware of these risks and ask their customers to change the password to use the device which would be critical to their privacy.  

Till this day Shodan remains the most popular search engine of its kind, however, competitors such as ZoomEye, and BinaryEdge are becoming more famous in the domain. But does shodan still stand as the “Scariest search engine on the internet”? I believe in terms of search engines, shodan would hold that title, as even if it is intended for good and ethical purposes it also has a very powerful negative side that can be used for crimes. Shodan might be created with good intentions for research purposes but turned out to be a very powerful tool for hackers, or perhaps script kiddies as serious hackers would have more advanced tools and methods to perform attacks. The fact that anyone with minimal computer knowledge can find locations of devices all over the world that ranges from smart fridges and home cameras to nuclear facility and industrial control systems is not the norm.
