Today, there are billions of IoT devices, many of which, be-
cause of limited hardware capabilities, often have bad security.
Securing these devices is very important - the attacks of the
Mirai botnet showed the high magnitude of damage brought
by infected IoT devices.
The case study highlighted Shodan’s capabilities and how
maliciously it can be used for launching attacks related to IoT
devices. Even a security camera installed in a yard can give
adversaries information that they might use for causing much
harm. However, Shodan is also an excellent tool for security
awareness and tracking vulnerabilities. Shodan exposes the
vulnerabilities of anything that it indexes. IoT device man-
ufacturers can use this information to improve the security of
their products, and the knowledge that the vulnerabilities are
publicly available acts as a motivator for them (they have to
fix them as soon as possible before the adversaries discover
them).
Shodan is also widely used for researching the security of
IoT devices. A Google Scholar search reveals that there are
4300 papers that explicitly mention Shodan and security, and
among these, there are 2090 papers (48.6%) that also explicitly
mention IoT or the Internet of Things.
Shodan can be used in many ways by malicious actors.
Many powerful tools (e.g. Metasploit) use Shodan API.
Shodan’s filter system allows users to find desired devices
easily and quickly. For instance, with the ”vuln” filter, it is
possible to search for devices with a certain vulnerability (e.g.
Heartbleed). This can be very useful for an adversary that has
created an exploitative program and is looking for devices for
spreading it. The user-friendliness of Shodan also makes it
possible for script kiddies to easily find publicly accessible
devices (e.g. webcams) and tamper with them.
Many devices on Shodan have the option of installing
updates but are poorly protected. If an adversary gets access to
such a device, he/she can install malware instead of updates.
This malware can be of many types, for example, making the
device a part of a botnet and then using it for DDoS attacks
(This is what happened with the Mirai Botnet).
Devices found on Shodan also include devices (e.g. pro-
grammable logic circuits) that can be parts of critical in-
frastructures. In this case, an adversary tampering with those
devices would bring much harm. For example, as part of the
research, to show the capabilities of Shodan, all of the nuclear
power plants in France were identified.
Shodan also contains information about many web servers
worldwide. A malicious actor could use this information for
orchestrating an appropriate attack, which might lead to data
theft and privacy invasion.
On the other hand, all these capabilities of Shodan can
be used for good as well. White hat hackers can use it to
scan networks, analyze devices and find vulnerabilities. They
can then use the information gathered from Shodan to seal
backdoor access to their devices, maintain secure banners, pro-
tect accidentally exposed databases, or patch vulnerabilities.
With the help of Shodan, all of these can be done before an
adversary discovers those same vulnerabilities. Shodan also
makes it possible to locate malware command and control
servers. In that case, the defenders can even launch an attack
on malicious servers.
Shodan is also widely used by academic researchers for
gathering data and drawing conclusions. As already discussed,
a Google Scholar search of the terms ”Shodan” and ”security”
result in 4300 papers about the topic.
In 2013, CNN stated that “Shodan: The scariest search
engine on the Internet.” Since then, cyberspace has changed
very much. Although there are many ways of using Shodan
maliciously, it is not appropriate to state that Shodan is still the
scariest search engine. There are several reasons for this. First
of all, Shodan has tried its best to limit the activity of malicious
users - there’s a limit on the number of searches a person
can do. Without registration, the limit is 10 searches, while
with an account, the limit rises to 50 [2]. If the user needs
more searches, they’ll need to buy one of Shodan’s premium
packets and state their intentions. Also, some filters (e.g. tags)
are unavailable unless the user buys the paid packets. The
purchase will reveal some information about the user, thus no
malicious actors will be using Shodan at its full capability.
Other than that, Shodan has many alternatives, such as
ZoomEye, Censys, or Criminal IP, which do not have strict
search limits.
