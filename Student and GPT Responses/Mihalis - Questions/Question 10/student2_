Shodan use should be restricted to its targeted market only. Even though hackers would use other tools to perform their hacks, private information should not be displayed out to the public “Legally” as done by Shodan. In my opinion, Shodan should only be used by research facilities and by security companies that would make optimal and legal use of the tool. Shodan should also not display detailed information and extracted data from vulnerable devices found when port-scanning. Even though shodan displays vulnerabilities of these devices based on their operating systems and software they use that can be found through other sources, displaying it to the public and especially hackers would make it easier for them to exploit those vulnerabilities hence if a version of Shodan is made to the public, it should not display the vulnerabilities of these devices. These policies should also be implemented on all Shodan-like search engines.
