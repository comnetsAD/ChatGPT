A sample policy regarding the use of Shodan and similar
tools:
1) Purpose - To define the restrictions and requirements for
publicly available device-indexing search engines.
2) Scope - This policy applies to all search engines or tools
that are publicly available and index devices connected
to the internet. These will be mentioned as ”specified
tools” throughout the rest of the policy.
3) Exposing Critical Information - The specified tools
may expose some information that wasn’t meant to be
exposed to the public. Several regulations have to be
maintained to minimize the chance of this information
falling into the hands of malicious actors.
If the specified tool exposes such information:
• Each user of the specified tool must provide their
personal information in order to use the specified
tool with its full functionality.
• Only minimal functionality should be available for
the use of the tool without providing personal infor-
mation. These limitations include but are not limited
to:
– Limited number of searches
– Limited available filters
– Limited search results
These limitations may not apply if the tool offers only
general statistics rather than information about specific
devices.
4) Critical Infrastructures - the specified tool must hide the
devices that, if compromised, can bring harm to critical
infrastructures of the country. Refer to the country’s
legislature for the definition of critical infrastructures.
5) User Guidance - the website hosting the specified tool
must also provide a guide to a user on how to adequately
use the tool and how not to step outside the bounds of
ethics. The website must also discourage the user from
establishing a connection with devices found with the
specified tool.
