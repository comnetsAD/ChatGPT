Shodan is not entirely unique in the sense that there are other
similar scanning tools that exist freely on the internet. For a
government body, accounting for each and every tool individual
would be unreasonable and impractical. A uniform policy
regarding the scanning engines like Shodan that would cover all
the relevant aspects can be potentially introduced by
governments in order to define exact boundaries on what is
allowed and what is not.
Such a policy could cover various points, including
obligatory background checks for individuals/organizations
involved in the use of Shodan-like search engines. This could
eliminate the threat from certain parties wishing to employ the
tools in malicious ways, but it will happen at the expense of free
access to information, which is arguably one of the most crucial
rights existing nowadays. A more comprehensive approach
would be to clearly define the legality of different use scenarios
of Shodan-like tools. This could involve, for instance, the
implementation of user protocols that would only allow the use
cases that involve testing of one’s own devices and equipment,
and limit access to the devices beyond one’s own IP address.
Alternatively, governments can impose extensive security
requirements related to the available functionality and enabled
use cases to Shodan and other companies directly. This would
put the burden of complying with security standards on the
companies, which evidently will negatively impact them, but it
might in turn reduce the rate of criminal activity that involves
the use of Shodan-like tools and services.
