What are the challenges to mitigating climate change? We must first recognise it as a threat and realise that it affects our lives, and this needs to be mitigated. We must know what causes climate change and what alternatives can be used to stop it. We must find a way to convince people to change their behaviour to use more sustainable alternatives once we've found them. And then we need a way to verify that people are applying the sustainable practices they say they are, as well as evaluate the efficacy of these practices to improve them. 

Measurement plays a key role in all of these factors. We need to be able to measure temperature rises of global warming, sea level rises in order to realise this issue. We need to measure the effect of greenhouse gases as well as how much are produced by different activities in order to identify causes and suggest alternatives. And so on. Without measurement, we would have no information to build mitigation on, we might not even know it's a problem. 

In the current situation, however, I think the crux of the problem is measuring the impact of climate change on people's lives. This is because the toughest part of the above tasks is actually getting people to change their behaviour, because people are set in their ways, are only interested in profits and don't want to take any economic risks. But if we could demonstrate, unequivocally, how climate change directly affects so many people, we could make a far more compelling case to companies to reduce emissions and to governments to introduce better legislature, so that we can collectively combat climate change. But as we've seen in researching our projects, for instance, it's very tough to accurately quantify the impacts of climate change, as tangible as they clearly are, which presents a great challenge for mitigation.
