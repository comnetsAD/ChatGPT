I agree with the statement. 

Measurement helps in priority management. Measurement of the climate change impact is made difficult given the diversity of problems. Addressing climate change is challenging because the climate impact on each geographical region varies. For example, heat waves are major threats in equatorial countries while rising sea levels and disappearing shorelines are more urgent for countries located in lower altitudes. This inconsistency in measurement and large room for the unknown slow down the process of actually tackling the issue as we do not know what to prioritize and, at worst, have to go at it all at once if the estimation is significantly biased. On top of that, measurement is further complicated as politics gets involved. Data collection can be intervened by political bodies to represent a better image on the international playground. As discussed in the meeting with Marci and several of our previous discussions, scientists do not have full control over the measurement tools and data manipulation is so easy to accomplish either in science or politics. Accuracy, thus priority, is compensated along the way. In the end, measurement is a challenge given its implications on the efficiency of climate change mitigation.
