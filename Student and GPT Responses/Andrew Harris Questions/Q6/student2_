Measurement is one of the most important issues related to mitigating climate change. We see that measuring climate change itself, measuring its risk to our way of life, and measuring costs of mitigating and not mitigating climate change are all issues of measurement. Even though all these problems play an imperative role, the primary one of these is measuring the costs of mitigation or deciding not to mitigate the issue. 

For example, from our readings in the MFF, we read about the discounting factor applied to future generations, and the cost of mitigation came to be quite high today and non-mitigation seemed like a viable option too. However, how can this measurement be perfect; the measurement was made using certain assumptions that may not transpire and reality might be the complete opposite. Also different people/institutions are likely to put a very different value or likely to cost the mitigation cost very differently, leading to conflicts. Many insitutions may value the cost of not mitigating to be lower and thus decide to let things be - which we know in the long run is not a good idea. 

If we were able to correctly value the cost of not mitigating the issue, and how the compared cost of mitigation is worth it, we would have empirical evidence to convince the majority of individuals, institutions, and corporations to work towards a common goal. However, since putting a definitive value is almost impossible, people fluctuate whether to invest their time, wealth, and effort in mitigating climate change, making it the most difficult aspect to deal with.
