It is not accurate to claim that measurement is the primary challenge to mitigating climate change. While measurement is certainly an important aspect of addressing climate change, it is not the only or the primary challenge. Climate change is a complex and multifaceted issue that requires a comprehensive and coordinated approach to address.

First, measurement is important in order to understand the scope and scale of the issue, and to track progress in reducing emissions and promoting sustainable development. However, this alone is not sufficient to address the issue, as it requires a range of actions from mitigation to adaptation. These actions include reducing greenhouse gas emissions, investing in renewable energy, protecting and restoring ecosystems, and building resilience in communities.

Secondly, the measurement of emissions and progress in reducing them, is just one aspect of addressing climate change. Climate change also requires addressing socio-economic and political issues, as well as addressing the equity aspect of the issue. Climate change disproportionately affects marginalized and vulnerable communities, therefore it is important to ensure that the solutions are inclusive and equitable, and that the rights and needs of these communities are respected.

Thirdly, measurement is also dependent on the availability of reliable data and the accuracy of the methods used to measure emissions, which can be challenging. The measurement of emissions from certain sectors such as aviation and shipping, can be challenging as well as the measurement of emissions from certain sources such as agriculture and land use.

In conclusion, measurement is important in understanding and addressing climate change, but it is not the primary challenge
