According to my understanding, human beliefs are the key drivers of climate change because humans themselves contribute to climate change, or the prevention efforts. That is, whether humans believe climate change is an ongoing catastrophe or whether they disregard its existence as a threat to human and natural life, affects the course of climate change itself. Human beliefs are multiple and varied, but whether that favours climate change or not is irrelevant to how it affects it. I believe climate change is an active phenomenon that is destructive by nature, and my friend can disagree with me and believe that climate change does not exist and it is all a part of evolution, but actions follow beliefs, which in turn contributes to a chain reaction. My belief will force me to be more sustainable and consume less energy, and my friend's belief will not force her to change her behavioural patterns because she does not recognize a threat. Nevertheless, whatever course one chooses to follow contributes to the climate crisis at hand, whether that is helping mitigate it or adding to it. Human beliefs drive any action, and climate change is one of them, because climate change is a direct result of human action. It is not only the key driver of the crisis, but the only driver, because if humans left the world untouched there would be no disaster pending, as nature would've followed its natural course.
