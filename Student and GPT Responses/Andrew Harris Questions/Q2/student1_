Whether human beliefs are key drivers of climate change or not is a hard question to answer. I do believe that climate change is driven by human actions, and I think it is fairly evident that human actions in personal and large scales have been causing climate change. However, the question to answer here is whether or not these actions are driven by human beliefs. I can see that some of the actions that we take on personal scale is simply out of habits and not human beliefs. There may sometimes be no ideology associated with flying to travel around the world and using your personal vehicle everyday. However, in this day and age many have contested the personal actions that contributes to climate change. Hence, I think there is enough awareness for one to be aware that our actions do contribute to climate change but yet our beliefs may be the driver of our actions in this case. Often times, we can seen some fractions of population feel violated when there are restricted put on some of their ""rights,""  for sake of climate change. When I think of the fraction of people protesting against the limitation put on carbon emissions, for example, I agree more with the statement put in the prompt. 
When it comes to action in large scale that drives climate change, I think of corporations and governmental and big non-governmental bodies. Here, it is evident that policy makers have to have opinions on what actions and policies are to be made. And while one might hope for policy makers to make calculated and non-emotional decisions, there will always be a point where policy makers will have to make a decision on what variables are more important, what we will be prioritizing, and this is almost always driven by human beliefs.
