Local ownership in the issue of climate change is the idea that people have the capacity to address the issue of climate change and make tangible changes to the situation we are in, in terms of climate change. The strength of this particular idea lies in the fact that local concerns are at the center of discourse in actions and decisions that are taken in order to mitigate climate change. 
It is important to look at the bigger picture of climate change and especially the forces that have made it difficult to mitigate or fight climate change and the actions that are deteriorating the climate. One of the factors that do not help us in regards to fighting climate change is the fact that there is a concern regarding countries and even more local forces on how much sovereignty each of these entities are willing to lose in order to cooperate on a larger or global scale to fight the problem of climate change. Since climate change is a global issue, I will take it as a given that there needs to be action taken should be on a global scale. Local ownership takes into account the local concerns and that possibly makes it effective in terms of having less objection from the local committee. I am apprehensive on how it will later scale out in a global scale.
