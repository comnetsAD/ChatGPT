I think our class discussions on the book thus far have increasingly established the difficulty of solving climate change from a top-down approach. We may have to rely on a more bottom-up approach where sustainability begins through local solutions that then scale to global trends. One main reason for this is that the need for sustainability is more obvious locally, at least in terms of resource management. For example, fig I am given a certain amount of fuel and told I need to survive based only on that, then I will realise that using that fuel to develop a renewable energy source is the only way to survive long-term, and that I cannot just burn all the fuel immediately. In that sense, local ownership will make individual parties responsible for their own management of resources and mitigating the effect that climate change and other factors have on them. This can lead to local solutions and this explains why individuals are more likely to be locally invested in sustainability and mitigating climate change than global entities like corporations or governments. However, in many cases, local impacts of climate change may not be urgent enough to encourage local climate action, and so this decentralised paradigm needs to be coupled with global action and regulation to make local solutions scale to global trends that everyone adopts. Overall, however, an only-central top-down approach cannot work by itself, so creating local ownership that can lead to local solutions should be an essential part of addressing climate change.
