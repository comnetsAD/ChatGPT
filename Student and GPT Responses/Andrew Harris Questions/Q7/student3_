Local ownership is crucial in combating climate change. Firstly, the ability for smaller communities and individuals to independently manage a piece of land allows finer control of actions and adaptations that may be overlooked by a more centralized approach to ownership. For example, through local ownership, the people that live and depend on the land are likely to know what‚Äôs best for it and how to act in its best interests so that it remains to provide for them. Secondly, mistakes can average out. What does that mean? Suppose two different communities run neighboring plots of land. One takes a less than ideal decision, the other doesn‚Äôt. The entire land is not affected by the poor decision, only a part of it is. Eventually, these mistakes can be observed and overall better decisions can be taken globally. However, when central authorities make poor global decisions, all/most of the land is affected. This may lead to greater ramifications. Nevertheless, the question still remains on how to coordinate local efforts towards a more globally climate-friendly direction. That‚Äôs where regulation comes into play. Local ownership does not mean unregulated ownership. Regulations and incentives can be put in place to help focus global efforts while maintaining local ownership and control to make resource use as efficient as it can be.
