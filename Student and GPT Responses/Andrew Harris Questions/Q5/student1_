Violence can be productive if violence actually produces some changes regarding climate change mitigation. For example, violence can raise awareness. When an issue has culminated in brutality as a response, that built-up response can act as an impetus for change. Unfortunately, in practicality, this is hard to achieve.

When the authority is doing wrong to the environment, civilians who are afraid of violence would shy away from protests or any initiatives that go against the current authority. This fear of violence bars individuals from expressing their climate concerns to some extent regardless of the level on which their lives are affected by climate change. 

When police violence is aimed at protests which are the collective effort of concerned individuals, violence would accumulate more hate and distrust. Suppressing violence using violence is a brutal way to exacerbate an inherently violent system caused by climate change in which the civilians are the victims. 

In the end, violence can be productive but realistically not feasible.
