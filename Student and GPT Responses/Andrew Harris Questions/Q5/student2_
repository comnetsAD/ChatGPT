My initial instinct is to disagree with this, specifically for combatting climate change, because it is difficult to target climate-related violence. There may be corporations and oil companies that are particularly deleterious to the environment through their activities, but would attacking an oil refinery or assassinating an oil executive (as Frank suggests) help to mitigate climate change? Are these appropriate targets and how do we decide that? Who the perpetrators of this violence are would also influence the political narratives surrounding it. If violence is uncontrolled, it becomes destructive. For it to be controlled, it needs to be targeted. But with climate change, it is difficult to assign responsibility. From the book, for instance, when the Children of Kali talk about the 'guilty', that assessment is likely very subjective. That some people's actions caused the heat-wave, that was probably not their intention, and so is it fair to hold them completely responsible? In our real-world, we haven't yet agreed upon a concept of 'climate criminals'. Of we did, maybe that allows for productive violence, but until then we have not yet created a system of accountability to enable productive violence for climate change 

In general, violence can be an effective tool for bringing about change as it can shock leaders, create urgency among the population and most importantly, reclaim agency for people who have had theirs taken away. However, climate change is a problem that requires collective agency to solve. We need to tackle the issue as a concerted effort of humanity, otherwise different sides will form and not everyone will adhere to climate change mitigation, which will make it very difficult to solve the problem. Acts of violence (like destroying an oil refinery for e.g.) will antagonise some people. Much of the public will view climate activists as troublemakers and people will not be accepting of the movement. That could threaten our collective agency to tackle this problem as a group.
