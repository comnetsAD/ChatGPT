It is not accurate to claim that violence, or the threat of violence, can be a productive force with respect to mitigating or adapting to climate change. Violence is destructive and harmful and should never be promoted as a solution to any problem. It can lead to loss of life, injury, and damage to property, and it can cause immense emotional and psychological suffering. Furthermore, violence can also lead to further polarization and hinders the development of constructive solutions.

Climate change is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach, which includes mitigation and adaptation measures, and it requires the cooperation and collaboration of a wide range of actors, including governments, businesses, and civil society organizations. The use of violence or the threat of violence can only lead to the obstruction of the constructive dialogue, cooperation and collaboration that are needed to address this issue.

Additionally, violence and the threat of violence can disproportionately harm marginalized and vulnerable communities, who are often the first and most affected by the impacts of climate change. Instead of resorting to violence, it is important to work towards inclusive and equitable solutions that respect the rights and needs of these communities.

In conclusion, violence and the threat of violence are never a productive force in addressing climate change or any other issue. They lead to destructive and harmful consequences, and they can only hinder the development of constructive solutions. Climate change is a complex issue that requires a multi-faceted approach, cooperation, and collaboration, and it is important to work towards inclusive and equitable solutions that respect the rights and needs of marginalized and vulnerable communities.
