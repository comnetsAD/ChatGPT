I believe that physical violence and constriction of rights are both counterproductive for climate change discourse and social action.

It is true that the ‚stick sometimes works better than the carrot one just has to look at the case for regressive taxation to realize that.  However, it is also true that humans do not like having their autonomy treaded upon. Consequently, because the perceived benefit of better climatic conditions is not immediately visible to people, it is harder for society to justify violence in the case of non-compliance with climate change policy. Consequently, because it is hard to defend, the social acceptance of such violence is unlikely to arise, and this dampens the effectiveness of coercive apparatuses. In a nutshell, unless there is ideological acceptance of its need, violence (or even the thread of violence) is unlikely to change people‚Äôs behavior of climate change; it is arguably more likely that people will rise up to challenge the violence and those who cause it. Furthermore, because acts of violence often have to be perpetrated by one actor against another (herein, the actors can be individuals or organizations), they are shaped by personal biases, whereby the perpetrator(s) cannot account for all contexts. Consequently, it is difficult to assess when the benefits of productive violence are justified by the results since the results‚Äô effects and usefulness are perceived differently by different individuals and different groups. I, therefore, believe violence, at a fundamental level, should be avoided, lest someone be harmed too much inadvertently.
