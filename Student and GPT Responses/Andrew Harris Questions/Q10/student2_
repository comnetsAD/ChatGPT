I disagree with the statement. Policy change is the goal, but it is not the only goal. The most efficient and quick outcome we get out of civil disobedience is raising social awareness. And that is also the goal of civil disobedience. We need numbers, the more the better as a lot of people can facilitate quicker change in policy. Although policy change is the final point we want to get at, disregarding the process of gathering public attention as an impetus for change everytime civil disobedience does not lead directly to policy change is dismissive and not beneficial to the overall effort social workers are making. In conclusion, failure to generate policy change is not a failure. It can be considered a success somehow as we succeed in educating the public, emphasizing one in many ways how the government is unresponsive to public demand, and giving citizens a lot of chances to reevaluate their states crucial to their decision-making in any political involvement later.
