The very purpose of civil disobedience is to make policy changes. If it does not, it is a failure as it could not meet its purpose. It can still be meaningful in the sense that it has enhanced awareness on a matter and has voiced out what could ‚Äì in some cases ‚Äì be unpopular opinion, but it still counts as a failure in terms of meeting its goal. People who engage in civil disobedience such as the Extinction Rebellion in the field of climate change do so in order to call for changes on a political and systematic level that can't be achieved by individual efforts. Thus, civil disobedience would be regarded as being successful only when such changes have been made ‚Äì that is, only when people no longer have to disobey.
