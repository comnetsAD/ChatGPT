I would argue that while civil disobedience can be an effective tool for bringing attention to issues and sparking change, it is not always the only metric for determining its success. Civil disobedience is a form of protest that is intended to disrupt the status quo and bring attention to issues that are not being addressed by the government or other authorities. In many cases, civil disobedience can lead to policy change, but it is not the only outcome that should be considered.

It is important to note that civil disobedience is not always intended to lead to immediate policy change, but it also serves to raise awareness and educate the public about an issue. It also can create an opportunity for dialogue and negotiation, which can lead to more sustainable solutions than if policy change was the only outcome. Moreover, it can also lead to more structural and systemic changes in society, rather than just a change in policy.

Additionally, the fact that civil disobedience does not lead to policy change does not mean that it is a failure. Policy change can take time and require a sustained effort, and civil disobedience can serve as a catalyst for that change. Furthermore, it can also lead to other forms of change, such as a shift in public opinion or the creation of new social movements.

In conclusion, while civil disobedience can be an effective tool for bringing attention to issues and sparking change, it is not always the only metric for determining its success. Policy change should not be the only outcome that is considered when evaluating the success of civil disobedience. Other forms of change, such as awareness raising, dialogue, and systemic change can also be considered as successful outcomes.
