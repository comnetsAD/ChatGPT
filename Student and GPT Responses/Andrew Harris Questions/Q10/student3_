I do not believe that civil disobedience‚Äôs success is solely dependent on policy change in the form of concrete state legislation. Rather, civil disobedience can accomplish change in different ways that can still be useful in many ways.

As Extinction Rebellion demonstrated, a major objective of civil disobedience in the context of the climate change problem is to bring attention to the issue and inspire people to make changes. Given how climate change is not a very visible problem, the spectacle of civil disobedience can be very useful in educating people, especially by conveying the urgency of the issue to them. Furthermore, though it is true that the systematic issue of climate change is not solvable solely through individual action, individuals deciding to partake in civil disobedience can still cause change by forcing companies to change their practices. Even if legal regulation is not implemented, companies might be pressured into changing their practices to be more climate-friendly (such changes can come out of a desire of greenwashing or genuine helpfulness, but the end result should still be useful in combatting the problem). Moreover, given how solidarity is such an important feeling when it comes to spurning action in people, civil disobedience undertaken as a collective can serve as a stepping stone to broader movements that ultimately bring concrete change in the context of the climate change problem.
