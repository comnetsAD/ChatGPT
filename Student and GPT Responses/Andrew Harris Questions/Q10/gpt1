It is not accurate to say that civil disobedience should only lead to policy change and if it does not, it is a failure. Civil disobedience is a form of protest and non-violent resistance, that aims to bring attention to a specific issue and create change, but it is not the only way to achieve this.

Civil disobedience can be an effective tool to raise awareness and bring attention to an issue, but it is not always the most effective way to bring about policy change. For example, it can be a powerful way to bring attention to issues that are not being addressed by the government, but it may not be the best approach for addressing complex issues that require a multi-faceted approach.

Additionally, policy change can be a slow process and it may take time for change to occur, even after a successful civil disobedience campaign. Furthermore, civil disobedience can be a powerful tool to create change but it is not the only tool, and it should be used in conjunction with other forms of activism, such as lobbying, advocacy, and grassroots organizing.

In conclusion, civil disobedience is an important form of protest and non-violent resistance, but it should not be considered as the only way to achieve policy change. It is a powerful tool to raise awareness and bring attention to an issue, but it is not always the most effective way to bring about policy change. Policy change can be a slow process and it may take time for change to occur, even after a successful civil disobedience campaign, and it should be used in conjunction with other forms of activism, such as lobbying, advocacy, and grassroots organizing.
