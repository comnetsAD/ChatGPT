One way to think of whether or not technological advances will mitigate the concerns regarding climate change is by looking at whether or not it has been able to solve the problems in the present and the past. It is true that technological advances in the last century at least have been very very impressive. However, most of the technological advances that humans today find very impressive are in the field of information technology and not in the field of mitigating concerns and effects of climate change. There hasn‚Äôt been nearly as impressive technological advancements in solving the issue of micro-plastics as much as there has been unwanted presence of the substance in the seas inhabited by water animals. We are already in many such crises where we can‚Äôt blindly trust the technological advancements to come save us. 

Another point I would like to make is that even if we are convinced and rely on what technological progress has been able to do to mitigate the problem is enough to deal with the issue of climate change, what we risk to climate change is simply too much to work on assumptions. The things that we may be losing to climate change are far many for us to simply operate on our trust on what we humans will do/invent in the future when we can make changes right now.
