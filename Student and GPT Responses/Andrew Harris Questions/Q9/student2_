Frequently, the world's governments are faced with difficult decisions; namely, navigating the balance between individual autonomy and the public good. During the pandemic, enforcement of preventative measures such as mask-wearing, social distancing, and, later on, vaccinations raised questions of abuse of power and heightened authoritarian practices. With regards to climate change, certain effective measures may tread on personal autonomy and choice. Placing emission limits, reducing food options, etc. can all be effective measures in climate change that come at some cost to personal autonomy. One, then, has to ponder is the objective of mitigating climate change is more important than the ethical concerns of limiting personal autonomy and potential abuse of authority? Well, more often than not these measures have alternatives that raise fewer ethical concerns. In the case they do not, one has to seriously consider whether these measures will actually be effective and must define clear limits on how and until when these measures will be carried out. Ethical costs are massive and are not to be taken lightly by the world's authorities. No matter how pressing the issue, we must not let our ethical concerns be put to the side in favor of the task at hand. During the pandemic, many governments entrusted with emergency powers abused the trust of the people, leading to greater silencing of the press, attacks on political opponents in the name of the pandemic, etc. Hence, we should not be blinded by the importance of climate change and neglect our ethical frameworks when it comes to policy.
