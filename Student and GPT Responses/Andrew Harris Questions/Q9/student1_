I do agree with the statement for two reasons. Firstly, it is challenging to reach a consensus on ethical concerns given the world is divided with diverse backgrounds and interests. Although the notion of global citizenship indicates the one-people nation - the world nation, this umbrella term is so big that one centralized authority cannot regulate actions towards climate change mitigation. Even within a country, different regions and cities have different priorities and characteristics. Sitting down for round-table discussions to reach a unanimous agreement on what constitutes fairness in the whole complex spectrum of relativity and divergence is too much of an effort to prioritize over actual action-taking steps. Secondly, since climate change is a global common problem which is time sensitive, action should be taken and laws should be enforced in a timely manner if we ever want to save future generations. However, this should not mean a total disregard of ethical concerns as things fall apart in a destructively unfair world eventually. Instead, there should be a threshold which is admittedly hard to determine but ideally the one which can unify people to work for a common cause under a nudged, or forced if needed, situation yet at the same time does not totally disrupt ethical boundaries.
