As Gaurav mentioned today, deciding that climate mitigation is more important than other ethical concerns is in itself an ethical choice. Climate mitigation is necessary for the existence of the entire population so it seems ethical to prioritize it over everything else for the "greater good". However, we have to remember that the reason we are trying to mitigate climate change is for the sake of human survival. Therefore, prioritizing climate action is prioritizing human existence. So this raises the question, when we prioritize human survival, do we just want to see the species surviving the crisis or do we want to keep the civilization intact as well? Because if it is just the survival of the species then prioritizing mitigation of climate change makes sense but human civilization is intrinsically intertwined with human ethics. Therefore, we cannot sacrifice human ethics if we hope to keep the civilization alive. We have to draw the line somewhere that dictates upto what extent can we go before we can say that human civilization is not worth the actions. I say this because I think the actions we take stem from our principles, our principles from our ethics, and our ethics come from the fact that we are civilized animals. So if we ignore ethics just for survival, then survival will not be worth it.
