I believe national democracies are the basis of effective regulation for climate change as they represent the sentiment of the majority of the people. Their decisions are, therefore, the result of national democratic processes. Eliminating the structure of democracies even slightly will not be taken lightly by the masses. Take, for example, the responses to the recent pandemic: multiple countries declared extensive rights of the state which led to considerable public backlash. 

It would also mean that regulations for climate change are not enough; the education system and state media should also steer the public's opinion on the grave danger of climate change and the urgency of preventive action. This is something that requires long-term planning, however implementing these changes is considerably more subtle - some democratic processes may be bypassed to inform everyone of critical thinking, of understanding climate change and what actions are necessary to circumvent it. 

As mentioned in the WBGU article, the need for rapid research & development cannot be understated. This requires funding from the state, and statistics presented in Beyond Climate Neutrality show a staggeringly low percentage of GDP allocated to research. These funding schemes are often not decided by the population, and democratic processes would not be applicable here. We can see that without these democratic processes, funding has often been misguided or allocated to more destructive, less long-term aware ventures.
