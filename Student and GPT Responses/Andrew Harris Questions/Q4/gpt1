The idea that national-level democratic processes are incompatible with long-term planning for climate change is a flawed one. Climate change is a long-term problem that requires long-term solutions, and democratic processes are an essential part of finding those solutions.

Democratic processes provide a mechanism for citizens to express their views and participate in decision-making. They also provide a way for citizens to hold their elected representatives accountable for their actions. This is essential in the context of climate change, as it allows citizens to express their concerns about the impacts of climate change on their communities and to hold their representatives accountable for taking action to address those concerns.

Moreover, democratic processes can provide a way for citizens to participate in the development of long-term policies that address climate change. This can include policies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote energy efficiency, and protect vulnerable communities. By allowing citizens to participate in the development of these policies, democratic processes can help to ensure that they are fair, effective, and widely accepted.

Furthermore, national-level democratic processes also provide a way for countries to cooperate and coordinate their efforts to address climate change. International agreements such as the Paris Agreement are developed through democratic processes and require the participation of different countries, thus providing a way for countries to work together to address a global problem.

In conclusion, national-level democratic processes are not incompatible with long-term planning for climate change. In fact, they are crucial in addressing this issue. Democratic processes provide a way for citizens to express their views, hold their representatives accountable, and participate in the development of long-term policies and international cooperation. Without democratic participation, it would be difficult to develop fair, effective, and widely accepted policies to address climate change, which is a global problem that needs cooperation from all nations.
