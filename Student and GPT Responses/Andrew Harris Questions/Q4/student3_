I largely agree with the statement. After all, democratic processes‚Äô flaws often make long-term planning and action difficult. Because the scope of governmental work is often limited by term durations, election campaigns often focus more on immediately visible change, such as infrastructure fixes, rather than gradual transformation, such as climate change reversal. This issue of different priorities often seeps into in-office work, especially when re-election is on government officials‚Äô agenda. Another issue with the electoral process is that in extreme cases, changes in government can sometimes lead to reversal of policies. Consequently, attempts to reverse climate change by one government can turn out to be useless in the long term. Furthermore, because action against climate change requires widespread individual change, it is often to difficult to get support for policies that would greatly affect people‚Äôs lifestyles and/or quality of living (e.g., a change in the energy mix driving up electricity costs). In comparison, authoritarian governments, such as that of China, have more leeway to make unpopular decisions that might be better in the longer term but not so popular at first look (as is often the case with climate change policy). Furthermore, such governments can often implement action with more swiftness since there is less of an issue with opposition stalling legislation; this speed is very important for an important issue such as climate change.
