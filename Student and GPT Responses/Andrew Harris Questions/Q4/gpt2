It is not accurate to claim that national-level democratic processes are incompatible with long-term planning for climate change. While it is true that climate change requires long-term planning and action, democratic processes can play an important role in addressing this issue.

First, democratic processes provide a means for citizens to hold their elected officials accountable for addressing climate change. Through elections and other forms of civic engagement, citizens can advocate for policies and actions that address climate change and hold elected officials accountable for their actions on the issue.

Secondly, democratic processes provide a means for citizens to participate in decision-making about climate change. Through public consultations, citizen juries, and other forms of public engagement, citizens can provide input on climate policies and actions and ensure that their voices are heard.

Thirdly, democratic processes ensure that decisions on climate change are transparent and accountable. Through open government and access to information laws, citizens can access information about climate policies and actions, and hold decision-makers accountable for their actions.

However, it is also important to note that democratic processes alone may not be sufficient to fully address climate change. Climate change is a complex issue that requires action from a variety of actors, including governments, businesses, and civil society organizations. Therefore, it is important to engage a wide range of actors in addressing climate change and ensure that their actions align with democratic values and principles.

In conclusion, national-level democratic processes are not incompatible with long-term planning for climate change. Democratic processes provide a means for citizens to hold elected officials accountable, participate in decision-making and ensure that decisions are transparent and accountable. However, it is important to note that democratic processes alone may not be sufficient to fully address climate change, therefore it is important to engage a wide range of actors in addressing climate change.
