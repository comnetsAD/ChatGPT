As a person who comes from a very politically unstable country where every new leader quashes the efforts of the previous one, the above statement feels true. But it doesn't necessarily have to be that way. Even in a democratic nation where people are elected based on their stance on various issues, certain topics are not discussed upon. On the bsais of my very limited knowledge of US politics, I have noticed that no presidential debate discusses whether or not women deserve to vote. In my country, political leader don't talk about rights to get an abortion. This is because certain things are agreed upon by both (or all) parties. As unlikely as it may seem, if every party agrees on the fact that climate change is a crisis that requires consistent enforcement of long-term regulations, then democrary can be compatible.

It might be interesting to think that even if the involved parties don't agree on the topic, democracy might still be compatible with long-term planning. This is because, theoretically, democracy is a people's government. People decide on who gets to be elected and whose plans are going to succeed. So if the majority of the people support long-term planning for climate change, and the stance of a party on climate change is their primary criteria to vote for them, then we have a scenario where long-term planning is effective because of democracy. I understand that this is more of a wishful thinking but I do believe that it isn't entirely improbable.
