The public ownership of necessities such as energy and transportation infrastructure would help mitigate climate change by allowing for more efficient and sustainable management of these systems. Under private ownership, the primary goal is often to maximize profits, which can lead to inefficiencies and a lack of investment in sustainable technologies. In contrast, under public ownership, the primary goal is to serve the needs of the community, which would align with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and transitioning to renewable energy sources.

Furthermore, public ownership would allow for more equitable access to necessities. Many low-income communities and marginalized groups currently struggle to afford basic necessities such as energy and transportation, which can perpetuate poverty and inequality. Public ownership could ensure that these necessities are affordable and accessible to all members of the community, regardless of their income level.

Additionally, public ownership would allow for more democratic control over these systems. With private ownership, decisions are often made by a small group of shareholders or executives, but with public ownership, decisions would be made through democratic processes, ensuring that the needs and concerns of the community are taken into account.

In conclusion, the public ownership of necessities would help mitigate climate change by allowing for more efficient and sustainable management of these systems, more equitable access to necessities, and democratic control over these systems. It would be a step towards a more just and sustainable future.
