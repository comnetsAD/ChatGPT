As with anything, when a given asset or entity is owned by a group of people as opposed to one individual, the responsibility is not only shared but each person is held accountable by the others. With climate change, it is a shared responsibility to mitigate it as globally, everyone plays a role in contributing to the crisis. Public ownership of necessities would mean that the state controls institutions and necessities that are used by everybody and there could be a social dividend. Public ownership is better than private ownership in terms of mitigating the climate crisis because everybody in a society is equally entitled to certain necessities and rights but they are just as likely to hold each other responsible. With private ownership for instance, involves the use and control of goods and services without any obligations towards the rest of the community. Oftentimes, this use is damaging and harmful to the environment, but self-interest trumps communal responsibility. Thus public ownership can solve the blame game to some extent as the responsibility is shared, and mitigating climate change becomes a social action instead of an individual one. It is essentially a question of power and control which prevents action and accountability, which public ownership works around.
