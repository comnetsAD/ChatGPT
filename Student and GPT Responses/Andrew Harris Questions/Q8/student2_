Yes, I support the statement that public ownership could be helpful in mitigating climate change. Firstly, to create ownership public ownership, there would have to be state involvement and the intervention of the state where necessities could be a public good. As I mentioned in one of my previous responses, that state involvement is crucial for limiting global warming as they can use their legitimacy and authority to introduce reforms such as energy goals that work towards achieving sustainable development of energy. 

Moreover, if more goods are owned by the public, the affairs of the goods are bound to be more transparent and therefore subject to greater scrutiny. If the public is responsible and wants to fashion a society that holds itself responsible for environmental damage, scrutiny of public goods will follow. For example one may question whether public goods such as street lights are powered by renewable sources or fossil fuels. Whether the public transport is using energy efficiently or not. Moreover, the public will have a definitive say in how the institutions that overlook the affair of these goods are governed, taking away power from capitalist and wealthy corporations, who usually do not find environmental sustainability in their best interests. Thus, public ownership can create transparency and accountability, which could be used to mitigate climate change.
