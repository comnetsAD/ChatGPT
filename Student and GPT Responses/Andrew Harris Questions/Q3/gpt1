Confronting climate change requires a comprehensive and coordinated approach that includes the enforcement of appropriate laws and regulations. Governments play a crucial role in this effort by setting standards and policies that are necessary to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Laws and regulations can include measures such as setting emissions limits, implementing carbon pricing, and promoting renewable energy. These measures provide clear guidance and incentives for individuals, businesses, and other organizations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions and transition to more sustainable practices.

However, the role of state enforcement alone is not sufficient. The private sector and other decentralized actors also have a crucial role to play in enforcing correct climate action. For example, businesses can make a commitment to reduce their carbon footprint, invest in renewable energy, and develop sustainable products and services. Additionally, civil society organizations and individuals can also advocate for and promote sustainable practices.

It is also important to recognize that climate change is a global issue that requires cooperation and coordination among different levels of government and sectors. The absence of state enforcement should not discourage private or other decentralized actors from enforcing correct climate action. Decentralized actors can set an example and lead the way by implementing sustainable practices and policies, which can in turn encourage governments to take more ambitious actions.

In conclusion, confronting climate change requires a comprehensive and coordinated approach that includes the enforcement of appropriate laws and regulations by the government, but also the active participation of private and other decentralized actors. The absence of state enforcement should not discourage private or other decentralized actors from enforcing correct climate action.
