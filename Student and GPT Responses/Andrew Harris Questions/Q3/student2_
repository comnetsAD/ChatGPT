I believe that government actions are crucial in combating climate change, however "private or other decentralized actors" could not be relied upon for the enforcement of climate-related regulations. One of the reasons being compromise: combating climate change is all about compromise. It is the compromise of convenience, of labor, of capital to invest in the future, and compromises are usually not the most straightforward options to select - a sacrifice of something in order to achieve something else. This is often in contrast with the modus operandi of social, decentralized actors, whose operations usually rely on simple, idealistic goals to drive the actions of the group. This can lead to misguided actions and could cause even more damage to the climate.

For private actors, it is even more problematic since the power is centralized and the guiding philosophy is hidden. The ideals underlying operations could be misguided, and they could also be selfish. These can include ulterior motives and schemes that ultimately benefit the private actors while not necessarily improving the future of our planet. It would even be more concerning if these private actors secretly control the decentralized groups, steering the public opinion against people pushing for actual change.

Of course, the government's laws can also be misguided or not effective. However, they are transparent; the rules of the law can be read by anyone and anyone can push for change.
