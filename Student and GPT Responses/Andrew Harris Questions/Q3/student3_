The bulk of change has to come from the government, from institutional entities, or those responsible for the enforcement of law and order, those liable for making policies and decisions that would allow the smooth operation of the state. Ideally, state enforcement would be the best option since it is the most legitimate source of authority and is the most likely to be able to enforce laws. For example in the EU, Germany is particularly known as a pioneer in Climate Change Policy, where the state is enforcing a move towards renewable energy and today more than 40% of energy generated in Germany comes from renewable sources.

In the absence of state enforcement, private sectors share a responsibility in curbing climate change.  Civic society can have a major effect on issues of climate change - the decision of a union or company to plant a tree for every 10 sales made, a step by a community to move to renewable energy and recycling. However, note that these are not enforcements but voluntary decisions an entity would make and follow upon. Enforcing these on others in the community could lead to violence since these private and decentralized actors do not have the legitimacy nor the support or authority. Yes, they can motivate and incentivize, but enforcement in my opinion has to come from the government and the state. Not only does another authoritative and enforcing entity challenge the status quo of the government but can also lead to a formation of an unintended monopoly which can stem other issues.
