A common strategy for identifying distantly related homologous proteins is to search the database using a short signature sequence indicative of the particular protein function. A short signature sequence is considered to be a better strategy than using a long sequence because:
High selectivity: A short signature sequence is more specific to a particular protein function, and it is less likely to match with non-related proteins in the database. This increases the chances of finding the correct protein among the hits in the database.
Low computational cost: Searching the database using a short sequence is computationally less expensive than using a long sequence. This is because a shorter sequence requires fewer calculations to compare to other sequences in the database, which can be a time-consuming task.
Robustness against mutations: Short signature sequences are often derived from conserved regions of a protein that are less likely to be affected by mutations, which makes them more robust for identifying homologs.
High sensitivity: Even though shorter, signature sequences are often derived from conserved regions of a protein that are essential for its function. This ensures that the signature sequence will identify closely related homologs as well as more distant ones, even if the sequence have undergone some mutations.
In summary, searching for distantly related homologous proteins using a short signature sequence is considered to be a better strategy than using a long sequence because it is more specific, less computationally expensive, more robust against mutations and more sensitive to evolutionary divergence.
