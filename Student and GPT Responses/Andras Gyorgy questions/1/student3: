C nucleotide form base pair with G nucleotide. Therefore, the percentage of C in the DNA will be equal to percentage of G, thus molar percent of G is 20%. A and T bases form a base pair molar percentage of A and T is thus 100% - 20% - 20% = 60%, so A and T will share equally the 60% left on the DNA. Therefore, molar percent of A will be 30% and molar percent of T will be 30% also.
