If human DNA contains 20% C on a molar basis, then the mole percent of A, G, and T would be 20%, 20%, and 60%, respectively. This is because in DNA, the four nucleotides are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G), and they always pair up in a specific way: A with T, and C with G. This means that for every C in the DNA, there must be a G, and for every A, there must be a T. Therefore, the mole percent of A, G, and T would be equal to the mole percent of C, which is 20%.
