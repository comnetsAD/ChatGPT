RNA polymerase is an enzyme that catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA. It reads the DNA code, and using one of the DNA strands as a template, synthesizes a complementary RNA molecule. RNA polymerase binds to a specific region on the DNA called a promoter, which serves as the starting point for transcription. The RNA polymerase then moves along the DNA, reading the genetic code and adding nucleotides to the growing RNA strand. This process continues until the RNA polymerase reaches a specific sequence called the termination signal, at which point transcription ends and the RNA molecule is released.
