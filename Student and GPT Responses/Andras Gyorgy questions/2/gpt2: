Translating broken or partial mRNAs can pose several dangers for the cell, including:
Non-functional or harmful proteins: The resulting protein from a partial mRNA may be non-functional or even harmful to the cell, which can lead to cellular dysfunction or damage.
Wasteful energy consumption: Translating partial mRNAs can lead to an increase in the number of non-productive translation events, which can consume a lot of energy and resources that could be used for other important cellular processes.
Inhibition of full-length mRNA translation: Partial mRNAs may inhibit the translation of full-length mRNAs, leading to a decrease in the production of functional proteins, which can be detrimental to the cell, especially if the proteins involved in essential processes such as growth, division, or repair are affected.
Inefficient use of ribosomes: In prokaryotes, translating partial mRNAs may lead to the formation of unstable ribosomes that tend to fall off the mRNA before translating it completely, this can lead to an increase in the number of truncated proteins which can lead to the formation of misfolded protein that can be toxic to the cell.
Increase in the stress on the proteasome: Translating partial mRNAs leads to the formation of truncated proteins that are targeted for degradation by the proteasome, which leads to an increase in the stress on the proteasome.
Misregulation of gene expression: translating partial mRNAs can lead to the formation of truncated proteins that can bind to and misregulate the expression of other genes.
