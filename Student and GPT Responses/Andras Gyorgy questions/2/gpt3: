Translating broken or partial mRNAs can pose several dangers for the cell, including:
Production of truncated or non-functional proteins: A partial mRNA may not contain all the necessary coding regions to produce a complete and functional protein, leading to the formation of truncated or non-functional proteins.
Inhibition of full-length mRNA translation: Partial mRNAs may compete with full-length mRNAs for translation resources, leading to a decrease in the production of functional proteins.
Increase in errors in protein synthesis: The presence of partial mRNAs can lead to errors in protein synthesis, which can result in the formation of non-functional or harmful proteins.
Misregulation of gene expression: Translating partial mRNAs can lead to the formation of truncated proteins that can bind to and misregulate the expression of other genes.
Increase in stress on the quality control machinery: Translation of partial mRNAs can lead to the formation of non-functional proteins that require the action of the quality control machinery such as the proteasome, leading to an increase in stress on this machinery.
