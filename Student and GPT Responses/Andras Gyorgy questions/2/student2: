The dangers partial mRNAs pose for the cell is that they would encode for the wrong amino acid sequence and thus the wrong protein, which will cost us a lot of damage in the cell. As the translation is a really crucial step for each cell and having broken mRNAs or mRNAs not with the right sequence of nucleotides will make us have wrong base pairing in the transfer RNA synthesis stage (which is the last step where we check whether we have the right amino acid), and thus would impact the cell after in a way larger scale.
