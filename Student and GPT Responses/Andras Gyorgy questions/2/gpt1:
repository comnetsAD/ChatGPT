Translating broken or partial mRNAs can pose several dangers for the cell. One danger is that the resulting protein may be non-functional or even harmful to the cell. Another danger is that the translation of partial mRNAs can lead to an increase in the number of non-productive translation events, which can consume a lot of energy and resources. Additionally, partial mRNAs may inhibit the translation of full-length mRNAs, leading to a decrease in the production of functional proteins. This can be detrimental to the cell, especially if the proteins involved in essential processes such as growth, division, or repair are affected. Furthermore, In prokaryotes, translating partial mRNAs may lead to the formation of unstable ribosomes that tend to fall off the mRNA before translating it completely, this can lead to an increase in the number of truncated proteins which can lead to the formation of misfolded protein that can be toxic to the cell.
