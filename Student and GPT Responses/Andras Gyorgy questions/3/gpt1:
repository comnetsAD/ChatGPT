Erwin Chargaff's observation that the mole percent of G is equal to the mole percent of C in DNA samples from a wide range of organisms, and the mole percents of A and T are equal, is based on the base pairing principle of DNA structure. In DNA, the four nucleotides are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G), and they always pair up in a specific way: A with T, and C with G. Therefore, for every C in the DNA, there must be a G, and for every A, there must be a T. This relationship between the nucleotides is the structural basis for Chargaff's rules.

However, not all DNA samples obey Chargaff's rules. In the case of the single-stranded DNA of the virus FX174, the mole percents are not equal as A=24, C=22, G=23 and T=31. This is because single-stranded DNA does not have the base-pairing constraints that double-stranded DNA has, allowing for variations in the nucleotide composition. The virus FX174's genome is a single-stranded DNA so it doesn't obey the rules. Single-stranded DNA is not constrained by base-pairing, so the nucleotide composition can vary more widely.
