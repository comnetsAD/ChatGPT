Erwin Chargaff made the important discovery that in double-stranded DNA, the mole percent of G is equal to the mole percent of C, and the mole percents of A and T are equal. This is due to the specific base-pairing rules in DNA, where A pairs with T and C pairs with G. However, this rule is not universal and it doesn't apply to all DNA samples, for example single-stranded DNA like the virus FX174's genome, where the mole percents are A=24, C=22, G=23, and T=31. As single-stranded DNA does not have the base-pairing constraints that double-stranded DNA has, it allows for variations in the nucleotide composition. Additionally, the base composition of DNA can vary among different species and also within the same species.
