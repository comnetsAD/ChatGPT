Chargaff's rules were based on complementary base pairing concept. This concept ensure that A and T bases will be paired in a double stranded DNA and G and C will also be paired, therefore the number of A and T and thus their molar percentage of A and T will be equal. The same for G and C where their number in DNA will be equal and so their molar percentages. Some DNA from virus FX174 will not obey the rules because it contains single strand. Single strand does not allow base pairing. Therefore, the number of bases will not necessarily match and so their molar percentages.
