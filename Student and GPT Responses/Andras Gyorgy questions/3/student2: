The structural basis of Chargaff's rules is that since DNA is a double helix where G and C and A and T form base pairs, they should have the same percentage of moles in the DNA. Indeed, DNA from FX174 does not obey this rule as it is a single stranded DNA, therefore, there would be no base pairing and each of A, C, G, and T would have its own percentage summing up to 100%.
