Erwin Chargaff's observations were based on the base pairing principle of DNA structure. In DNA, the four nucleotides (adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine) are paired in a specific way: A with T, and C with G. This base pairing leads to the observation that in double-stranded DNA, the mole percent of G is equal to the mole percent of C, and the mole percents of A and T are equal. This relationship between the nucleotides is the structural basis for Chargaff's rules.

However, not all DNA samples obey Chargaff's rules. For example, in the case of the single-stranded DNA of the virus FX174, the mole percents of A, C, G, and T are not equal, as A=24, C=22, G=23, and T=31. This is because single-stranded DNA does not have the base-pairing constraints that double-stranded DNA has, allowing for variations in the nucleotide composition. Additionally, Chargaff's rules were based on measurements of DNA from a wide range of organisms, and the base composition of DNA can vary among different species and also within the same species.
