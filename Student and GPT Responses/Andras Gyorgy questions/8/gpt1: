The nucleotide sequence in DNA to which RNA polymerase binds to begin transcription is called the promoter. The promoter is a specific sequence of nucleotides located upstream (on the 5' side) of the gene that is being transcribed. It serves as a binding site for the RNA polymerase enzyme, which recognizes the promoter and initiates transcription at that point. This promoter sequence usually contains specific consensus sequences for the different transcription factors to bind and recruit the RNA polymerase enzyme to the correct location.
