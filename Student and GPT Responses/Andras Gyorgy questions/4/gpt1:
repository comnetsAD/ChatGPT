The second law of thermodynamics states that systems will change spontaneously toward arrangements with greater entropy (disorder). However, living systems appear to be highly ordered, which would seem to violate this law. This apparent violation is not a true violation, as living systems are fully compatible with the laws of thermodynamics.

The key to understanding this apparent paradox is to recognize that living systems are open systems that exchange matter and energy with their surroundings. They take in energy and matter in the form of food and use it to organize their components and carry out metabolic processes. In doing so, they increase the entropy of their surroundings by releasing heat and waste products. The overall increase in entropy caused by the living system, including both the system and its surroundings, is greater than the decrease in entropy within the system itself.

In addition, the second law of thermodynamics states that entropy can never decrease in an isolated system. However, living systems are not isolated systems and are able to extract energy from their environment, allowing for the maintenance of a low-entropy state within the organism.

In summary, the second law of thermodynamics is not violated by living systems because they are open systems that exchange matter and energy with their surroundings. The entropy of the living systems and the surroundings taken together increases, resulting in a net increase of entropy.
