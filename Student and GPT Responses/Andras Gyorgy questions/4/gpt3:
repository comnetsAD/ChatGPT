The second law of thermodynamics states that systems will naturally move towards a state of greater entropy, or disorder. Living organisms, however, appear to go against this principle as they maintain a high degree of order and organization. This apparent violation of the second law is not a true violation as living organisms are able to maintain their ordered state through a process known as "dissipative structures" which is a way to maintain order by dissipating energy from the environment.

Dissipative structures are self-organizing systems that take in energy from the environment, and use it to maintain their internal order and carry out metabolic processes. This allows living organisms to maintain a steady state of low entropy, despite the second law of thermodynamics.

Additionally, living organisms are not isolated systems and are able to extract energy from their environment, allowing for the maintenance of a low-entropy state within the organism. This is possible because the second law of thermodynamics only applies to closed systems, while living organisms are open systems that are able to exchange matter and energy with the environment.

In summary, living organisms are able to maintain their ordered state through the process of dissipative structures, which allows them to take in energy from the environment and use it to maintain internal organization and carry out metabolic processes, and they are open systems that are able to exchange matter and energy with the environment, making them fully compatible with the laws of thermodynamics.
