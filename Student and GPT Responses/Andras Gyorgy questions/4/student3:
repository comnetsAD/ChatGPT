Living cells are not closed systems. This implies that living cells are exchanging energy with their surrounding. The law of thermodynamics applies to a closed system, however, living cells are inside the universe, which can be considered a closed system. However, living cells consume food and release energy from food to create order within themselves. Not only that, but also as living cells release this energy to the surrounding, they create order within them while creating disorder on the environment. The increase of disorder on the environment is higher than the increase of order within living things. Therefore, overall process of consuming food results in net increase of disorder in the universe. This agrees with the laws of thermodynamics.
