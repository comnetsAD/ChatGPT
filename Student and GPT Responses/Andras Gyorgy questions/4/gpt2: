Living systems are able to maintain their ordered state by constantly taking in energy and matter from their surroundings and using it to sustain their internal organization and carry out metabolic processes. This process is known as negative entropy or negentropy, which refers to the ability of living systems to maintain order and complexity by absorbing and utilizing energy from their environment.

The second law of thermodynamics states that entropy (disorder) will always increase over time in a closed system. However, living systems are open systems that are able to exchange matter and energy with their surroundings, allowing them to maintain a steady state of low entropy.

Furthermore, the second law of thermodynamics only applies to closed systems where the entropy is constant. The Earth and the living organisms on it are part of an open system, where the sun is providing energy for the living organisms to survive and thrive. The energy from the sun is driving the photosynthesis process in plants, which is the basis of the food chain for all living organisms.

In summary, living systems are able to maintain their ordered state by constantly taking in energy and matter from their surroundings and using it to sustain their internal organization and carry out metabolic processes, while the second law of thermodynamics only applies to closed systems where the entropy is constant, the Earth and its living organisms are part of an open system, making it fully compatible with the laws of thermodynamics.
