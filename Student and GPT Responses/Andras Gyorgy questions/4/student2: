Life is fully compatible with the laws of thermodynamics, as the closed systems are already ordered and do not usually impact their exterior environment. Indeed, how it actually works is that the closed systems (if we take the human body for instance) would be a system that is ordered but also creates disorder as it impacts its outside environment by releasing energy. Therefore, there is a balance at the end as order in closed systems will have some disorder impact on its surroundings.
