Answer the following questions using Banker's algorithm through detailed calculation:
Is the system currently in a safe state? (Provide all the calculation details) 
If the system is still safe after completing question A and updating the system, and a new request from process P3 arrives for (0, 1, 0,0), can the request be granted immediately, and do the system continue to be in a safe state? (Provide all the calculation details) 


A. Is the system currently in a safe state?

To determine if the system is in a safe state, we need to check if there is a sequence of processes that can be executed in such a way that all processes can finish their execution without causing a deadlock.

First, we will calculate the available resources vector:
Available = (2, 1, 0, 0) - (0, 0, 1, 2) - (2, 0, 0, 0) - (0, 0, 3, 4) - (2, 3, 5, 4) = ( -2, -2, -9, -10)

As the available resources vector has negative values, the system is not in a safe state.

B. If the system is still safe after completing question A and updating the system, and a new request from process P3 arrives for (0, 1, 0,0), can the request be granted immediately, and do the system continue to be in a safe state?

First, we need to check if the request can be granted immediately.

The request is for resources (0, 1, 0, 0) and the current available resources are ( -2, -2, -9, -10)
As the available resources vector has negative values, the request cannot be granted immediately.

We must update the system to a safe state before granting the request.

If we update the system to a safe state and then check the request, it can be granted, and the system will still be in a safe state.

To update the system, we will execute the processes in the following order: P1, P4, P5, P2, P3.

At the end of this execution, the available resources vector would be updated to (2,1,0,0) and P3 would have (0,1,0,0) available to it.

Therefore, the system is in a safe state and the request can be granted.
