A) Is the system currently in a safe state?

The Banker's algorithm is used to determine whether a system is in a safe state or not. It checks if there is a safe sequence of processes that can be executed such that the system will not enter into a deadlock state.

To check if the system is currently in a safe state, we need to check the following:

Check if the current allocation of resources to each process can be satisfied by the available resources and the maximum resources needed by each process.
Check if there is a safe sequence of processes that can be executed such that the system will not enter into a deadlock state.
Step 1: Check if the current allocation of resources to each process can be satisfied by the available resources and the maximum resources needed by each process.

Available resources: (2, 1, 0, 0)
Allocated resources for each process:
P1: (0, 0, 1, 2)
P2: (2, 0, 0, 0)
P3: (0, 0, 3, 4)
P4: (2, 3, 5, 4)
P5: (0, 3, 3, 2)
Maximum resources needed for each process:
P1: (0, 0, 1, 2)
P2: (2, 7, 5, 0)
P3: (6, 6, 5, 6)
P4: (4, 3, 5, 6)
P5: (0, 6, 5, 2)
We can calculate the need of each process as:
Need = Maximum resources needed for each process - Allocated resources for each process

P1: (0, 0, 0, 0)
P2: (0, 7, 5, 0)
P3: (6, 6, 2, 2)
P4: (2, 0, 0, 2)
P5: (0, 3, 2, 0)
Step 2: Check if there is a safe sequence of processes that can be executed such that the system will not enter into a deadlock state.

Start with the available resources and check if the need of any process can be satisfied.

If a process's need can be satisfied, mark it as finished and add its resources to the available resources.

Repeat the above steps for all the processes until all processes are marked as finished or no process's need can be satisfied.

Available resources: (2, 1, 0, 0)
Processes: P1, P2, P3, P4, P5
Check P1: (0, 0, 0, 0) <= (2, 1, 0, 0) => P1 can be finished
Available resources: (2, 1, 0, 0) + (0, 0, 1, 2) = (2, 1, 1, 2)
Check P2: (0, 7, 5, 0) <= (2, 1, 1, 2) => P2 can't be finished
Check P3: (6, 6, 2, 2) <= (2, 1, 1, 2) => P3 can't be finished
Check P4: (2, 0, 0, 2) <= (2, 1, 1, 2) => P4 can't be finished
Check P5: (0, 3, 2, 0) <= (2, 1, 1, 2) => P5 can't be finished

Since none of the process's need can be satisfied, the system is not in a safe state.

B) If the system is still safe after completing question A and updating the system, and a new request from process P3 arrives for (0, 1, 0,0), can the request be granted immediately, and do the system continue to be in a safe state?

Since the system is not currently in a safe state, the new request from P3 can't be granted immediately. The system needs to be brought to a safe state before any new requests can be granted. Once the system is in a safe state, the new request from P3 can be evaluated using the same steps of the Banker's algorithm to check if it can be granted and if the system will still be in a safe state after granting the request.
