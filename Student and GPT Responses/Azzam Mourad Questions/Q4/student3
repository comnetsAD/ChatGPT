A)
I did the following calculations on the sequence P1, P4, P5, P2, P3 and found no deadlock occurring so I chose it as a safe state
Need
(0,0,0,0)
(0,7,5,0)
(6,6,2,2)
(2,0,0,2)
(0,3,2,0)
Available:
(2,1,0,0)
(2,1,1,2)
(4,4,6,6)
(4,7,9,8)
(6,7,9,8)
(6,7,12,12)
B)
It appears to be safe with the sequence P5, P3, P2, P1, P4 which I did the following calculations for assuming I accept P3's request of (0,1,0,0) and did not see the system enter a deadlock:
Need:
(0,0,0,0)
(0,7,5,0)
(6,5,2,2)
(2,0,0,2)
(0,3,2,0)
Available
(2,0,0,0)
(2,3,3,2)
(2,4,6,6)
(4,4,6,6)
(4,4,7,8)
(6,7,12,12)
I of course updated P3's allocation matrix before starting the algorithm to reflect the new allocation of resources and recalculated the need matrix.
