To develop a local CLI shell using C that replicates features from the Linux shell, you can use the fork() and exec() functions to create new processes and the pipe() function to create pipes for interprocess communication. You will need to use the pipe() function multiple times for the composed commands that include more than one pipe.

For example, to implement a command with one pipe, you would create two child processes using fork(). One child process would execute the command before the pipe and the other child process would execute the command after the pipe. The output of the first child process would be directed to the input of the second child process using the pipe.

To implement a command with two pipes, you would create three child processes using fork(). The first child process would execute the command before the first pipe, the second child process would execute the command between the two pipes, and the third child process would execute the command after the second pipe. The output of the first child process would be directed to the input of the second child process using the first pipe, and the output of the second child process would be directed to the input of the third child process using the second pipe.

Similarly, to implement a command with three pipes, you would create four child processes using fork(). The first child process would execute the command before the first pipe, the second child process would execute the command between the first and second pipes, the third child process would execute the command between the second and third pipes and the fourth child process would execute the command after the third pipe. The output of the first child process would be directed to the input of the second child process using the first pipe, the output of the second child process would be directed to the input of the third child process using the second pipe and the output of the third child process would be directed to the input of the fourth child process using the third pipe.

It's also important to handle the error cases, such as the failure of fork() or exec() function properly, and also close the file descriptor that are not needed.
