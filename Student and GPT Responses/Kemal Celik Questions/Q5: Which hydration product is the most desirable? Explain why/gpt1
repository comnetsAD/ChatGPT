The most desirable hydration product in the production of Portland cement is calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H).
C-S-H is the main hydration product that forms when cement is mixed with water. It is a gel-like material that fills the space between the cement particles and binds them together. This is what gives concrete its strength and durability. C-S-H is formed from the reaction between the calcium ions in the cement and the silica and alumina in the aggregates.
C-S-H is desirable because it has several properties that are important for concrete:
High compressive strength: C-S-H has a high compressive strength, which is the ability of the concrete to resist crushing forces. This makes it an ideal material for building structures like bridges, buildings, and roads.
Low porosity: C-S-H has a low porosity, which means that it is relatively impermeable to water. This makes it resistant to weathering, erosion, and chemical attack, which helps to extend the life of the concrete.
High durability: C-S-H has a high durability, which means that it can withstand the stresses and strains of everyday use over a long period of time.
Low thermal expansion: C-S-H has a low thermal expansion, which means that it does not expand or contract much with changes in temperature. This helps to prevent cracking in the concrete due to temperature changes.
Low shrinkage: C-S-H has low shrinkage, which means that it does not shrink much as it dries. This helps to prevent cracking in the concrete as it dries.
Overall, C-S-H is the most desirable hydration product in the production of Portland cement because it has several important properties that contribute to the strength, durability and performance of concrete.
