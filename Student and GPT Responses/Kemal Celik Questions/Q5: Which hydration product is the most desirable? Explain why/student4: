Calcium Silicate Hydrates (C-S-H) are the most desirable product because they form a layered structure with very high surface area ( 100-700 m2/g). They have high Van der Waals forces, thereby making the highest contribution to strength. They account for 50-60% of solids in the hydrated cement paste.
