The most desirable hydration product in cement is Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H), which is formed by the reaction between the calcium oxide (CaO) and silica (SiO2) in cement with water. C-S-H is the main binder in concrete and the main contributor to the strength and durability of concrete.

C-S-H has a number of desirable properties that make it the most desirable hydration product in cement:
High strength: C-S-H forms strong bonds between the cement particles, which gives concrete its high compressive strength.
Low porosity: C-S-H forms a dense structure, which makes concrete less permeable to liquids and gases. This helps to protect the steel reinforcement from corrosion and increases the durability of the concrete.
Low shrinkage: C-S-H has a low coefficient of thermal expansion, which means it does not shrink or expand much when exposed to temperature changes. This helps to prevent cracking in the concrete.
Low alkali-silica reactivity: C-S-H is not reactive with the alkalis in the cement and silica in the aggregates, this means it does not cause expansion or cracking in the concrete due to alkali-silica reactivity.
Low carbonation: C-S-H is not reactive with carbon dioxide, this means it does not cause internal corrosion of the steel reinforcement due to carbonation.
In summary, C-S-H is the most desirable hydration product in cement because it is the main binder in concrete and the main contributor to the strength and durability of concrete. It has a number of desirable properties such as high strength, low porosity, low shrinkage, low alkali-silica reactivity, and low carbonation which make it the most desirable hydration product.
