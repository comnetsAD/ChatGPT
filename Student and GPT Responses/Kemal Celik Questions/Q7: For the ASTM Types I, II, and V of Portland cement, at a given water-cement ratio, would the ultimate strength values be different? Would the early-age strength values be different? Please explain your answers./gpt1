For a given water-cement ratio, the ultimate strength values of ASTM Types I, II, and V of Portland cement may be different. ASTM Type I is a general-purpose cement that is used for most common concrete applications, Type II is a moderate sulfate resistance cement and Type V is a high sulfate resistance cement. Each type of cement has different chemical and physical properties that can affect the strength of the concrete.

The ultimate strength values of concrete made with ASTM Type I, II, and V cements may be different because each type of cement has different chemical and physical properties that can affect the strength of the concrete. For example, Type V cement has a higher percentage of tricalcium aluminate (C3A) which can contribute to higher early strength, but also to lower long-term strength. Type II cement has a lower percentage of C3A which can contribute to lower early strength but higher long-term strength.

Regarding the early-age strength values, it could be different as well, as Type II and Type V cements are designed to have lower early strength than Type I. This is because Type II and Type V are designed for specific applications where lower early-age strength is acceptable in exchange for improved long-term strength and/or sulfate resistance.

It's important to note that the strength of concrete is influenced by many factors, such as the water-cement ratio, curing conditions, aggregate type, gradation, and mineralogy, air content, temperature, and humidity. Therefore, the strength values of concrete made with different types of cement will depend on the specific mix design, curing conditions and other factors.
