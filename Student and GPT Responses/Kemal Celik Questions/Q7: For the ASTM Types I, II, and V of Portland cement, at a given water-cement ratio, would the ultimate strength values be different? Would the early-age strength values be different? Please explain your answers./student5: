Given the same water-cement ratio, the final ultimate strength values would be similar. This is because the final ultimate strength does not depend on the different types of cements but rather on the mix ratios. Early-age strength will be different because the cement types give different curing characteristics to the concrete which will therefore take different times to reach the design strength. Type I cures in 28 days, type II takes 45 days and type V takes 14 days.
