For a given water-cement ratio, the ultimate strength values of ASTM Types I, II, and V of Portland cement will not be different. This is because the ultimate strength of concrete is primarily determined by the water-cement ratio and the curing conditions, rather than the type of cement used.

However, the early-age strength values may be different for ASTM Types I, II, and V of Portland cement. This is because the early strength of concrete is influenced by the chemical composition of the cement, as well as the water-cement ratio and curing conditions.

ASTM Type I is a general-purpose cement that is suitable for most uses. Type II is a moderate sulfate-resistance cement, and Type V is a high sulfate-resistance cement. These types of cements have different chemical compositions, and therefore, may have different early strength values. For example, Type V cement has higher amounts of tricalcium aluminate (C3A) which can lead to higher early strength but lower ultimate strength.

In general, Type II cement may show slightly higher early-age strength values than Type I and Type V cements, due to its moderate sulfate-resistance, while Type V cement may have the lowest early-age strength values due to its high sulfate-resistance. However, these differences in early strength values are typically small and may not be significant in most cases.

In conclusion, the ultimate strength values of ASTM Types I, II, and V of Portland cement would be similar for a given water-cement ratio, but the early-age strength values may differ due to their chemical compositions.
