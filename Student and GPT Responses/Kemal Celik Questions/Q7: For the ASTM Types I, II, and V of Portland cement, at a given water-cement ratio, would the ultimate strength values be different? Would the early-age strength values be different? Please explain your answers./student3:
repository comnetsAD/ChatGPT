Yes, the ultimate strength values and early age strength values would be different. Type I - Hight C3S content gives rise to high strength development at an early age. Type II - Low C3S content, designed to resist sulfate attack. Type V - very low C3S content, resistant to seawater, produces strength very slowly. Ultimate strength ranking: 1. Type V, 2. Type II, 3. Type I. Early-age strength ranking: 1. Type I, 2. Type II, 3. Type V.
