Cement has a direct effect on porosity and strength. ASTM Types mentioned above, the rates of hydration and strength development with Type 5 and Type 4 cements and with portland-slag and portland-pozzolan cements are slower up to 28 days; however, the differences usually disappear thereafter when they have achieved a similar degree of hydration, More days meaning more compressive strength. At a given temperature of hydration, the degree of hydration is time dependant and so is the stength.
