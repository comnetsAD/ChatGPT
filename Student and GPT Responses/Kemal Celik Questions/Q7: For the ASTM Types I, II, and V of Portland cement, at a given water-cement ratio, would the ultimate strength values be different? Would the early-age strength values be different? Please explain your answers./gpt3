ASTM Types I, II, and V of Portland cement are different types of cement that have different chemical compositions and properties. These types of cements differ in their chemical composition, mainly in the amount of tricalcium aluminate (C3A) and the fineness of the cement.

At a given water-cement ratio, the ultimate strength values of ASTM Types I, II, and V of Portland cement may be different. Type I cement, also known as "normal" or "ordinary" Portland cement, has a low C3A content, which leads to a slower rate of hydration and a lower ultimate strength. Type II cement, also known as "moderate sulfate resistance" cement, has a moderate C3A content and a moderate rate of hydration, resulting in a moderate ultimate strength. Type V cement, also known as "high sulfate resistance" cement, has a high C3A content, leading to a faster rate of hydration and a higher ultimate strength.

Regarding the early-age strength values, the ASTM Types I, II, and V of Portland cement may also have different values. Type I cement typically has a relatively low early-age strength due to its low C3A content. Type II cement has moderate early-age strength due to its moderate C3A content, and Type V cement has high early-age strength due to its high C3A content.

It is important to note that the fineness of the cement also affects the early-age strength, and Type V cement is usually finer than Type I and Type II which also contributes to its higher early-age strength values.

In summary, at a given water-cement ratio, the ultimate strength and early-age strength values of ASTM Types I, II, and V of Portland cement may be different due to their different chemical compositions, mainly in the amount of tricalcium aluminate (C3A) and the fineness of the cement. Type I cement has low C3A content and low ultimate and early-age strength, Type II cement has moderate C3A content and moderate ultimate and early-age strength, and Type V cement has high C3A content and high ultimate and early-age strength.
