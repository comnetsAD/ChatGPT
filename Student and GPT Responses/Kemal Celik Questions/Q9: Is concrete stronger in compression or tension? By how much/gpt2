Concrete is much stronger in compression than in tension. The compressive strength of concrete is typically several times greater than its tensile strength.

The compressive strength of concrete is generally in the range of 20 to 40 MPa (3000 to 6000 psi), while its tensile strength is usually only about 10 to 15% of its compressive strength, or 2 to 6 MPa (300 to 900 psi). This means that concrete can withstand much greater loads when they are applied in compression than when they are applied in tension.

This is why concrete structures such as buildings and bridges are designed to resist compressive forces primarily, and are reinforced with steel bars (rebar) to provide additional strength in tension.

So, concrete is about 10-15 times stronger in compression than in tension, depending on the type and quality of the concrete used.
