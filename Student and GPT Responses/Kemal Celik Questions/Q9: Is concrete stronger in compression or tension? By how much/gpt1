Concrete is much stronger in compression than in tension. The compressive strength of concrete is typically about 10 to 40 times greater than its tensile strength. This is because concrete is a brittle material, and the structure of concrete is composed of small and large particles held together by a matrix of cement paste. Cement paste is weaker in tension than in compression, which leads to the difference in strength between compression and tension.

The compressive strength of concrete ranges from 20 to 60 MPa (3000 to 9000 psi) while the tensile strength is typically around 5 to 10 MPa (700 to 1500 psi). The exact compressive strength and tensile strength of a concrete mixture depends on a variety of factors, including the type and quality of the cement, the size and shape of the aggregate particles, the water-to-cement ratio, and the curing conditions.
