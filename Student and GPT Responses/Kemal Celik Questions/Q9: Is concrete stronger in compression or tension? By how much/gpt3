Concrete is much stronger in compression than in tension. Concrete is a brittle material, meaning that it is strong in compression but weak in tension. The compressive strength of concrete is typically around 20 to 40 times greater than its tensile strength.

The exact ratio of compressive strength to tensile strength will depend on the specific type of concrete and the conditions in which it is used. However, a typical ratio for normal weight concrete is about 20:1. This means that concrete can withstand around 20 times more compressive stress than tensile stress. For example, if the compressive strength of a concrete is 20 MPa, the tensile strength would be around 1 MPa.

It's worth noting that Reinforced concrete is a composite material made of concrete and steel reinforcement. The steel reinforcement provides the tensile strength, so the reinforced concrete has much higher tensile strength than plain concrete.
