Recycled waters from cities, mining, and many industrial operations can be safely used as mixing waters for concrete. Seawater, which contains about 35,000 ppm dissolved salts, is not harmful to the strength of plain concrete. However, with reinforced and prestressed concrete it increases the risk of steel corrosion; therefore, the use of seawater as concrete-mixing water should be avoided under these circumstances. As a general guideline, from the standpoint of the concrete strength, the presence of excessive amounts of algae, oil, salt, or sugar in the mixing water should send a warning signal.
