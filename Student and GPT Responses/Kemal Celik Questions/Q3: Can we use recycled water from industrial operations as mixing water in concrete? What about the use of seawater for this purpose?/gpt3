Recycled water from industrial operations can be used as mixing water in concrete, but it depends on the quality of the water and the specific requirements of the concrete mix. The water must meet certain water quality standards for pH, total dissolved solids, chlorides, and other contaminants. Additionally, the recycled water must be free of pollutants that could negatively impact the strength or durability of the concrete.

The use of seawater as mixing water in concrete is generally not recommended because seawater contains high levels of salt (chlorides) which can corrode the steel reinforcement in concrete and reduce the strength and durability of the concrete. Additionally, the high salt content of seawater can cause efflorescence (white salt deposits on the surface of the concrete) and can cause cracking and spalling of the concrete.

However, depending on the specific requirements, some studies show that by adding certain chemical admixtures such as calcium nitrite to the concrete mix, the use of seawater as mixing water can be possible. Additionally, the use of desalinated seawater or seawater with a low salt content can also be used as mixing water in concrete.

It is important to consult with a professional or expert in the field when considering the use of recycled or seawater in concrete to make sure that it meets the standards and requirements for the specific application.
