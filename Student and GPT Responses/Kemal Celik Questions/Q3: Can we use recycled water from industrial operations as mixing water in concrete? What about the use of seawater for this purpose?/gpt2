Recycled water from industrial operations can be used as mixing water in concrete, but it depends on the quality of the recycled water and the specific requirements of the concrete mixture. The water used in concrete must meet certain standards for pH, total dissolved solids, and other parameters to ensure that the concrete will set and harden properly. Industrial operations can generate water that contain large amount of dissolved salt and other impurities, which may not meet these standards.

Seawater can also be used as mixing water for concrete, but it poses some challenges as well. Seawater contains high levels of salt, which can cause corrosion of steel reinforcement in concrete and can also affect the setting and hardening of the concrete. Therefore, special techniques such as pretreatment of seawater, and the use of corrosion-inhibiting admixtures are required when using seawater as mixing water in concrete. Additionally, it is important to consider the cost and availability of seawater in certain regions.

It is also important to note that the use of recycled or seawater may require additional testing and monitoring to ensure that the concrete meets the required standards for strength and durability.
