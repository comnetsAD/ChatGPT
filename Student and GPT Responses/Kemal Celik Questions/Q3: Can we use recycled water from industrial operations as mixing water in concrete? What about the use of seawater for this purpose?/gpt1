The use of recycled water from industrial operations as mixing water in concrete is not recommended. This is because the water may contain impurities and chemicals that can affect the properties of the concrete and the strength of the final product. Additionally, the water may be contaminated with heavy metals or other harmful substances that can be harmful to the environment and workers.

On the other hand, the use of seawater as mixing water in concrete is generally not recommended due to its high salt content which can cause corrosion of steel reinforcement and can also affect the properties of the concrete. The high salt content can cause the concrete to have a lower compressive strength and can also cause the concrete to have a higher permeability. In addition, the high salt content can cause the concrete to have a lower resistance to freeze-thaw cycles.

However, it's worth noting that for some specific conditions, it's possible to use seawater as mixing water for concrete, for example in remote coastal locations with no access to freshwater, or in certain marine structures like offshore oil platforms, where seawater is the only available water source. In these cases, concrete mix designs that are specifically tailored to the high salinity of the seawater are used, and the concrete is often reinforced with corrosion-resistant materials.

So, in general, it is recommended to use potable water for mixing concrete, as it is free of impurities and chemicals that can affect the properties of the concrete. However, for specific conditions where seawater is the only available water source, special consideration and design must be taken into account to mitigate the effects of high salt content on the concrete.
