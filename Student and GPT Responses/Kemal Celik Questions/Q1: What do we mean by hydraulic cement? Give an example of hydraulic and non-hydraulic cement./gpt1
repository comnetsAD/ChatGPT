Hydraulic cement refers to a type of cement that sets and hardens through a chemical reaction with water. This reaction is called hydration. An example of a hydraulic cement is Portland cement.

Non-hydraulic cement refers to a type of cement that sets and hardens through a process called carbonation, which occurs when the cement comes into contact with carbon dioxide in the air. An example of a non-hydraulic cement is lime cement.
