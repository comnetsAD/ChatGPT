Hydraulic cement is a type of cement that sets and hardens through a chemical reaction with water, rather than just drying out. The chemical reaction between the cement and water is known as hydration, and it produces a substance called hydration products. These hydration products bind the aggregate particles together to form a solid mass. An example of hydraulic cement is Portland cement, which is the most common type of cement used in construction.

On the other hand, non-hydraulic cement, also known as air-entraining cement, relies on air-entraining agents to create microscopic air bubbles in the cement mixture. These air bubbles reduce the density of the hardened cement and improve its freeze-thaw resistance and workability. These types of cement harden by drying out and they do not have the capability of setting under water. An example of non-hydraulic cement is lime cement.

In summary, hydraulic cement sets and hardens through a chemical reaction with water, while non-hydraulic cement hardens by drying out. Portland cement is an example of hydraulic cement, and lime cement is an example of non-hydraulic cement.
