Cements that not only harden by reacting with water but also form a water-resistant product are called hydraulic cements. A cement is called hydraulic when the hydration products are stable in an aqueous environment. Hydraulic cement is capable of setting, hardening, and remaining stable underwater. It consists essentially of hydraulic calcium silicates, usually containing calcium sulfate. An example of hydraulic cement is portland cement, while an example of non-hydraulic cement is gypsum and lime cement.
