Hydraulic cement is a type of cement that sets and hardens through a chemical reaction with water. This reaction is called hydration and it results in the formation of calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) compounds. These compounds act as the binding agent in the concrete, and give it its strength and durability.

Examples of hydraulic cements include Portland cement, Pozzolanic cement, and slag cement. These types of cements are widely used in construction for making concrete, mortars and grouts. They can be mixed with water and aggregates (such as sand, gravel, or crushed stone) to create concrete, and can also be used to make mortars and grouts for various construction applications.

On the other hand, non-hydraulic cement is a type of cement that does not set and harden through a chemical reaction with water. Instead, it relies on air or carbon dioxide to harden. Examples of non-hydraulic cements include lime and gypsum plasters.

An example of non-hydraulic cement is Lime cement. Lime cement is made from limestone, which is heated to produce quicklime. The quicklime is then mixed with water to form lime putty. Lime putty can be used to make mortars, plasters, and stucco, but it cannot be used to make concrete. Lime mortars and plasters are used in traditional construction and are known for their flexibility, breathability, and resistance to weathering.
