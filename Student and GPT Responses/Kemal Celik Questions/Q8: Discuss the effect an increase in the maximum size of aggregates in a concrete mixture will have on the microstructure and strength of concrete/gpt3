An increase in the maximum size of aggregates in a concrete mixture will generally result in a coarser microstructure for the concrete. This is because larger aggregate particles will be less dense and more widely spaced than smaller aggregate particles. This can have a number of effects on the properties of the concrete, including:
A reduction in the strength of the concrete. The strength of concrete is largely dependent on the amount and quality of the bond between the cement paste and the aggregate particles. The coarser microstructure resulting from larger aggregate particles will result in less surface area for the cement paste to bond to, which will weaken the concrete.
An increase in the porosity of the concrete. Larger aggregate particles will create more voids in the concrete, which can increase the amount of water and air that is trapped in the microstructure. This can lead to a reduction in the overall strength and durability of the concrete.
An increase in the permeability of the concrete. The larger voids created by larger aggregate particles will also allow water and other liquids to pass through the concrete more easily, which can reduce its ability to resist water and chemical attack.
A reduction in the workability of the concrete. Larger aggregate particles will make it more difficult to place and compact the concrete, which can make it harder to achieve the desired final shape and finish.
Overall, increasing the maximum size of aggregates in a concrete mixture is likely to have a negative impact on the microstructure and strength of the concrete, so it's not generally recommended.
