With the same cement content and consistency, concrete mixtures containing larger aggregate particles require less mixing water than those containing smaller aggregate. On the contrary, larger aggregates tend to form weaker interfacial transition zone containing more microcracks. Increasing the maximum size of aggregate in a concrete mixture, decreases the needed amount of mixing water, but it also forms a weaker interfacial transition zone with more microcracks. Strength decreases but it depends on the W/C.
