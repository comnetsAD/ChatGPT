An increase in the maximum size of aggregates in a concrete mixture will have a significant effect on the microstructure and strength of concrete. Some of the main effects are:
Microstructure: An increase in the maximum size of aggregates will lead to a decrease in the number of aggregate particles per unit volume of concrete. This will result in a coarser microstructure, with fewer voids and more large aggregate particles visible.
Porosity: An increase in the maximum size of aggregates will lead to a decrease in porosity. This is because larger aggregate particles have less surface area than smaller particles, and therefore, less water is required to fill the voids between them.
Compressive strength: An increase in the maximum size of aggregates will lead to an increase in compressive strength. This is because larger aggregate particles can resist compressive stresses better than smaller particles, and therefore, the concrete will be stronger.
Flexural strength: An increase in the maximum size of aggregates will lead to a decrease in flexural strength. This is because larger aggregate particles are more brittle than smaller particles and are less able to withstand the tensile stresses that develop in concrete under bending.
Thermal conductivity: An increase in the maximum size of aggregate will increase the thermal conductivity of concrete. This is because the large aggregate particles will have a higher thermal conductivity than the smaller particles and therefore will transfer heat faster.
Shrinkage: An increase in the maximum size of aggregate will lead to an increase in shrinkage of concrete. This is because large aggregate particles have less surface area than smaller particles and therefore require less water to fill the voids between them, leading to a decrease in the water to cement ratio and an increase in the shrinkage.
In summary, an increase in the maximum size of aggregates in a concrete mixture will lead to a coarser microstructure, with fewer voids and more large aggregate particles visible, a decrease in porosity, an increase in compressive strength, a decrease in flexural strength, an increase in thermal conductivity and an increase in shrinkage. It's important to note that the effect of maximum size of aggregate on the strength and microstructure of concrete is highly dependent on the specific mix design and the type and properties of the aggregates being used. For example, if the aggregate is weaker than the cement paste, it may lead to a decrease in overall strength, despite having larger aggregate particles. Therefore, it is important to carefully consider the properties of the aggregates and the specific requirements of the project when selecting the maximum size of aggregate to be used in a concrete mixture.
