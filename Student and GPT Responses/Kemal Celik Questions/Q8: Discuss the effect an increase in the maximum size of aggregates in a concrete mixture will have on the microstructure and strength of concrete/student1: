Tensile strength is typically effected by the increasing size of the aggregate. The aggregate makes up around 70% of the volume of concrete and 80% of the mass of concrete. This means that its elastic properties and volume stability are highly important. Studies have showed that coarse aggregates typically yield higher compressive strengths and better workability. The aggregate phase typically has no direct influence on the strength of normal concrete. However, size and shape can affect in an indirect way. In simple terms, the larger the size of the aggregate and the higher the proportion of elongated and flat particles, the greater will be the tendency films to accumulate (bleeding).
