An increase in the maximum size of aggregates in a concrete mixture will have an effect on the microstructure and strength of concrete.

The microstructure of concrete is the arrangement of the cement paste and aggregates within the concrete. Larger aggregate particles will lead to a coarser microstructure, with wider spacing between the particles. This can lead to a reduction in the overall surface area of the aggregates that are in contact with the cement paste, resulting in a reduction in the amount of bonding between the aggregate and the paste. This can lead to a weaker concrete.

In addition, larger aggregate particles can lead to increased porosity in the concrete, as the larger particles may not be fully coated with cement paste. This can lead to greater water penetration and increased vulnerability to freeze-thaw cycles.

On the other hand, large aggregate particles can have a positive effect on the strength of concrete. Larger aggregate particles can provide a more stable structure for the concrete, as they are less likely to move or settle over time. They can also provide better support for the cement paste, which can lead to greater compressive strength.

The overall effect of an increase in the maximum size of aggregates on the strength of concrete will depend on the specific mix design and the properties of the aggregate particles. In general, it is important to consider the balance between the potential benefits and drawbacks of larger aggregate particles in order to optimize the strength and durability of the concrete.
