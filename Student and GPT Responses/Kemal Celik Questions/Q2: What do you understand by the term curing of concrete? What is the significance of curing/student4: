The term curing of concrete involves a combination of conditions that promote the cement hydration, namely time, temperature, and humidity conditions immediately after the placement  of a concrete mixture into formwork. The two objectives of curing are to prevent the loss of moisture and to control the temperature of concrete for a period sufficient to achieve a desired strength level.
