Curing of concrete is the process of maintaining the moisture content and temperature of freshly placed concrete until it reaches its desired strength. The curing process is essential for the proper development of the concrete's properties and durability.

After concrete is placed and finished, it needs to be kept moist in order to continue the chemical reactions that occur during the hydration process. These reactions result in the formation of calcium-silicate-hydrate (CSH) which gives concrete its strength and durability. If the concrete dries out during this process, the formation of CSH is hindered, and the concrete will not reach its desired strength.

Curing can be done by several methods such as ponding, misting, or covering the concrete with curing compounds or wet burlap, or by using a curing membrane. The most common method of curing concrete is by using water, which can be done by ponding, misting, or by spraying water on the surface.

The significance of curing concrete is that it ensures that the concrete reaches its desired strength and durability. Proper curing of concrete ensures that the concrete is less permeable to water and other liquids, which makes it more resistant to freeze-thaw cycles, chemical attack, and wear. Additionally, curing helps to prevent cracking, scaling, and surface defects in the concrete.

In summary, curing of concrete is an essential process that ensures the concrete reaches its desired strength and durability, and that it is less permeable to water and other liquids, which makes it more resistant to freeze-thaw cycles, chemical attack, and wear.
