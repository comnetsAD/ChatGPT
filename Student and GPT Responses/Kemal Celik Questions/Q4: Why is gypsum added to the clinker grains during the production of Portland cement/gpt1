Gypsum is added to clinker during the production of Portland cement for several reasons:
To regulate the setting time: Gypsum acts as a setting retarder, slowing down the setting time of the cement. This allows the concrete to be placed and finished more easily, and also helps to prevent cracking due to rapid setting.
To control the rate of hydration: Gypsum also slows down the rate of hydration of the cement, which helps to reduce the heat of hydration and prevent cracking due to rapid temperature changes.
To improve the workability of the concrete: The addition of gypsum improves the workability of the concrete, making it more plastic and easier to handle.
To improve the finish of the concrete: Gypsum also improves the finish of the concrete, giving it a smoother surface and reducing the need for additional finishing work.
To control the expansion caused by the formation of ettringite: In the presence of water, the clinker minerals form different compounds, one of them is ettringite, which can cause an expansion of the cement paste that can lead to cracking. The addition of gypsum to the cement will help to control the formation of ettringite and thus prevent expansion and cracking.

It's worth noting that the amount of gypsum added to the clinker during the production of Portland cement is usually small, typically between 3-5% by weight of the clinker.
