Gypsum, CSÌ… H2, is called the retarding agent of cement which is mainly used for regulating the setting time of cement and is an indispensable component. It is a mineral and is hydrated calcium sulfate in chemical form. It is added to the clinker to control the hydration of C3A.
Without gypsum, the reaction of C3A with water occurs very quickly and liberates high heat. When cement is hydrated, gypsum reacts with C3A quickly to generate calcium sulfoaluminate hydrate which deposits and forms a protection film on the cement particles to hinder the hydration of C3A and delay the setting time of cement. During the cement manufacturing process, upon the cooling of the clinker, a small amount of gypsum is introduced during the final grinding process.
