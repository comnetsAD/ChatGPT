Gypsum is added to the clinker grains during the production of Portland cement for several reasons:
Regulate setting time: Gypsum acts as a setting regulator, it slows down the setting time of the cement mixture. This allows more time for the concrete to be placed and finished, which is important for large projects like bridges and buildings.
Control the rate of hydration: Gypsum also helps to control the rate of hydration of the cement, which is the process by which the cement hardens and gains strength over time. This is important to ensure that the concrete hardens at a consistent rate and does not crack or weaken prematurely.
Control of the heat of hydration: Gypsum also reduces the heat of hydration, which is the heat generated by the chemical reactions between the cement and water. This is important to prevent cracking or damage to the structure during the curing process.
Improve workability: Gypsum also improves the workability of the cement, making it easier to mix, place, and finish. This is important for large projects that require a high degree of precision and consistency.
Improve the final product: Gypsum also helps to improve the final product by making it more durable and resistant to weathering, erosion and chemical attack.

Overall, the addition of gypsum to the clinker grains during the production of Portland cement is an important step in the manufacturing process to ensure that the final product is strong, durable, and consistent in quality.
