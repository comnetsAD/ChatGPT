Gypsum is added to the clinker grains during the production of Portland cement for two main reasons:

Control of setting time: Gypsum is added to the clinker to control the rate at which the cement sets. The chemical compound of gypsum, calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO4Â·2H2O), when added to the clinker, reacts with the tricalcium aluminate (C3A) in the clinker to form calcium sulfoaluminate hydrate (C4AH13), which slows down the rate at which the cement sets. This helps to ensure that the cement has enough time to be transported, placed, and finished before it starts to harden.

Control of early-age cracking: When cement is hydrated, heat is generated, which can cause the concrete to expand and crack. Gypsum is added to the clinker to control this expansion and prevent cracking. It does this by reacting with the C3A in the clinker to form C4AH13, which has a lower rate of hydration and therefore generates less heat. This helps to reduce the potential for early-age cracking in the concrete.

Additionally, gypsum also helps to prevent flash setting, which is a phenomenon where a cement sets too quickly due to a high content of C3A.

In summary, gypsum is added to the clinker grains during the production of Portland cement to control the setting time and to prevent early-age cracking in concrete, as well as prevent flash setting of the cement. It is a key ingredient in the production of Portland cement, and its precise control is essential for producing high-quality, consistent cement products. The amount of gypsum added to the clinker is typically around 3-5% of the total weight of the clinker, and it is added in the final stages of the cement grinding process. The precise amount of gypsum added can vary depending on the type of cement being produced and the desired properties of the final product.
