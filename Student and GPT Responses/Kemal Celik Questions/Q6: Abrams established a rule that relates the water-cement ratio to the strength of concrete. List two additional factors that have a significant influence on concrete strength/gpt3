Two additional factors that have a significant influence on concrete strength are:
Aggregate size and shape: The size and shape of the aggregate (stones or gravel) used in the concrete mix can have a significant effect on the strength of the concrete. Larger aggregate particles will typically result in a stronger concrete, while smaller particles will result in a weaker concrete. Similarly, more angular aggregate particles will result in a stronger concrete than more rounded particles.
Curing: Proper curing of concrete is crucial for the development of its strength. Curing is the process of keeping the concrete moist and at a suitable temperature for a period of time after it has been placed, in order to allow the hydration process to continue and the concrete to gain strength. If concrete is not cured properly, it will not achieve its full strength potential.

It's worth noting that the Water-Cement ratio (W/C) is one of the most important factors that affect the strength and durability of concrete, but also other factors such as curing conditions, aggregate type, gradation, and mineralogy, air content, temperature, and humidity can also have a significant influence on the final strength of the concrete.
