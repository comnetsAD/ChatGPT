The water-cement ratio is an important factor that relates to the strength of concrete, established by Abrams. However, there are several additional factors that also have a significant influence on concrete strength, including:
Aggregate-to-cement ratio: The ratio of aggregate (sand, gravel, etc.) to cement in the concrete mix also plays a significant role in determining the strength of the concrete. A higher aggregate-to-cement ratio generally results in stronger concrete, as the aggregate provides strength and stability to the mix.
Curing conditions: Proper curing of concrete is essential to its strength and durability. Curing refers to the process of maintaining a certain level of moisture and temperature during the hardening process. A proper curing environment, such as keeping the concrete moist and at a suitable temperature, will result in stronger concrete.
In summary, in addition to the water-cement ratio, the aggregate-to-cement ratio and curing conditions are two additional factors that have a significant influence on concrete strength.
