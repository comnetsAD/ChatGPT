Aggregate to cement ratio: The ratio of aggregate (sand and gravel) to cement plays a significant role in the strength of concrete. A higher ratio of aggregate to cement means there is less cement to bind the aggregate together, which can result in weaker concrete. A lower ratio of aggregate to cement means there is more cement to bind the aggregate together, which can result in stronger concrete.
Curing conditions: The curing conditions also have a significant influence on the strength of concrete. Proper curing, which is the process of keeping the concrete moist and at a consistent temperature, can help ensure that the cement hydrates properly, which can result in stronger concrete. Inadequate curing can lead to weaker concrete due to incomplete hydration or cracking.
Mixing and placement: The way the concrete is mixed, placed and compacted also have an impact on the strength of concrete. Improper mixing, placement, and compaction can cause voids, segregation or bleeding, which can affect negatively the strength of the final product.
Admixtures: Admixtures are chemical compounds that are added to the concrete mixture to improve or modify its properties. They can improve the workability, set time, strength or durability of the final product.
