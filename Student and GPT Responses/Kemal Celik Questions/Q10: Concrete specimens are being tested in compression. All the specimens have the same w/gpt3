The strength of concrete in compression will depend on the water-to-cement ratio (w/c ratio) and the curing conditions.

The specimens that are tested wet, or under a condition of saturated surface dry (SSD) will be stronger than the specimens that are tested dry. This is because the wet specimens have more water available to hydrate the cement, leading to a more complete reaction between the cement and water. This results in a stronger, more dense concrete with better bond between the cement paste and aggregate.

When concrete is tested dry, the lack of water will cause the cement paste to dry out, which can result in weaker concrete. The dry specimens may also have a higher tendency to crack, reducing its overall strength.

It is also worth mentioning that curing conditions play an important role in concrete strength as well. The curing of concrete is the process of keeping it moist and at a certain temperature for a certain period of time after it has been placed. Curing helps to ensure that the concrete reaches its maximum strength by allowing the cement to hydrate properly and by slowing down the rate of moisture loss from the concrete. Proper curing is essential to achieve the full strength potential of the concrete regardless if it was tested wet or dry.
