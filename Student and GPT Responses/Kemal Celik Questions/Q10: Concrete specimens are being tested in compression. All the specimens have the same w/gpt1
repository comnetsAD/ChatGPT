The concrete specimens that are tested wet will be stronger than those tested dry. The reason is that water helps to hydrate the cement in the concrete, which helps to improve the bond between the cement and aggregate particles. This improves the overall strength of the concrete. Additionally, the water in the concrete helps to fill any voids in the mixture, which can also increase the strength of the concrete.

When concrete is tested in compression, the aggregate particles are pushed together, and the cement paste surrounds them holds the aggregate particles together. The bond between the aggregate and the paste is stronger when the paste is hydrated, which is why wet concrete is stronger than dry concrete.

It's worth noting that if the concrete specimens are tested dry that means they were not cured properly, and if the concrete is not cured properly the strength will be reduced. Curing is the process of maintaining the proper moisture and temperature conditions after the concrete has been placed. This allows the concrete to reach its maximum strength and durability.
