It is difficult to say which specimen will be stronger without more information about the specific w/c ratio and the properties of the concrete being used. In general, concrete specimens that are tested wet will typically be stronger than those that are tested dry. This is because water helps to hydrate the cement in the concrete, which improves the bond between the cement and aggregate and increases the overall strength of the concrete. Additionally, the extra water in the mix can help to fill any voids in the concrete, further increasing its strength. On the other hand, concrete specimens that are tested dry may be weaker due to lack of curing and hydration process.
