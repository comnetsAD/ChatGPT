The video titled “How to teach your class to line up” published by KIPP New Jersey illustrates a set of effective guidelines for instilling discipline in a lower-grade classroom. The video features six very specific and practical instructions for school teachers to have their young students to be quiet, orderly, and well-behaved, with a demonstrated example of a seemingly majority Black charter school classroom. The contents of the video revolve around how, ideally, students in a lower-grade classroom should act in the context of a classroom—that they may not be familiar with because of their young age—in relation to the teachers. Students, dressed in neat uniform shirts, are instructed and encouraged to stay very quiet when the teacher is speaking, wait and listen to the teacher’s instructions, stay at a specific designated spot and move only when instructed, and walk in an orderly fashion and in good posture.
 
This video is fundamentally a presentation of how young students are socialized at school. The classic functionalist explanation of school as an “agency of socialization,” as laid out in Parsons’ foundational text, states that school is where “individual personalities are trained to be motivational and technically adequate to the performance of adult roles” (1964, p. 130). That is, the KIPP school’s very overt curriculum of discipline is intended to provide their students with understanding of rules and mannerisms required to fully function in society. In fact, most schools, especially in compulsory education, have some form of rules and regulations that ultimately familiarize students with the ways they should behave in social and professional settings later in their lives.
 
What is not directly addressed but can be clearly observed and inferred from the video is that the school serves a certain population of students, and whether it is a conscious decision or not, accordingly delivers certain disciplinary lessons. Disproportionate and racially targeted over-disciplining of Black students is a widely discussed and documented issue in U.S. schools. As Gregory et al. (2010) explains in their comprehensive study of the racial achievement gap, “national and state data show consistent patterns of Black disproportionality in school discipline over the past 30 years, specifically in suspension, expulsion, and office discipline referrals” (p. 59). A nationally representative study from 2003 shows that Black students were significantly more likely to be suspended than White or Asian students, and nearly one in five Black students had been suspended while 1 in 10 White students did (Kewelramani et al., 2007, as cited in Gregory et al., 2010).
 
Moreover, Tyson’s (2003) ethnographic study at all-Black schools suggests that Black students are subjected to extremely high standards of behavior and self-control, even—or especially—under Black educators, in order to “not confirm the stereotype of the uncivilized black person,” which is historically a narrative generated and circulated by White society (p. 333). That is, such racially targeted over-discipling happens because the White mainstream society has perpetuated a stereotypical image of Blackness as unruly, aggressive, disruptive, and inadequate. Racialized discipline as a socialization process results not only in missed instructional time and ultimately “a cycle of academic failure, disengagement, and escalating rule breaking” (Gregory et al., 2010, p. 60), but in not questioning the idea of compliance to authority—a White mainstream presence in many real life cases—and internalized notions of inadequacy inherent in the culture in many Black population.
 
If the students featured in the KIPP school video are rewarded for obeying authoritative order instructed by White teachers as part of the socialization function of schooling, and grow up to be susceptible to academic and professional underachievement as well as lack of capacity to think critically and disruptively about such disadvantage, schools are no longer providing equal opportunities for functional stratification as functionalists argued. In fact, a conflict approach would support this line of argument and directly challenge the meritocratic foundation of school. Conflict theory revolves around the notion that society consists of different status groups in conflict with one another for advantages in economic means, and education serves as an apparatus of social reproduction for the dominant groups to maintain the status quo.  (Collins, 1971, p. 90).
 
When Collins explains that “employers use education to select persons who have been socialized into the dominant status culture,” it signifies that Black students of low-income urban neighborhoods such as the KIPP school students, who are commonly subjected to differential socialization experiences in terms of values of discipline embodied, are often put at a disadvantage in competing for occupations associated with higher status (1917, p. 92). Bourdieu (1977), bringing in the notion of the dominant group’s monopoly of “desirable” cultural capital, similarly elaborates that “the educational system reproduces all the more perfectly the structure of the distribution of cultural capital among classes in that the culture which it transmits is closer to the dominant culture” (p. 57-58).
