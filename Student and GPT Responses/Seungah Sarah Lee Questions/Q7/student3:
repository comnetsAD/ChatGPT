Parsons argues that school is a socialization agent. A school education introduces children not only to the values of their families but also to those of society as a whole. Children are evaluated at home only by those standards that apply to their household, but at school, they learn society's norms and values as well as standards applicable to everyone. Socialization has a considerable impact on life skills and other decisions that an individual makes. The article aims to address how education and schooling lead to socializing of an individual into society. Specifically, the article highlights how the socialization process leads to an individual being able to develop the relevant social skills, norms, and societal values as a result of being a part of an education system. The article is split into subheadings, each communicating details regarding school as a social class. Parsons first talks about socialization and selection as the problem. Then the structure of elementaty school class. Moving on to the nature of school achievement. He also mentions family and peer group relation to the school class. Moreover, he further delves into socialization and selection in elementary school and in secondary school.
In addition, the socialization process that a schooling institution undertakes is integral since it helps ensure that students are exposed to the right level of the value-building framework, which integrates the values promoted by the families and essential social values highlighted by the schooling system. Specifically, such integration needs to be focused on eliminating an increased strain often placed on the students to achieve a particular grade or build skills for a specific occupation but needs to be focused on developing an ideal set of social values.
It is essential to note how each education system is organized in their respective country has an impact on the socialization processes that the students are exposed to. One of the core aspects of understanding this concept is related to how equally individuals in an education system are granted opportunities and recognition for their tasks. In addition to this, the schooling system also needs to ensure that they can promote a considerable level of equality in the interaction that is carried out between the students. An example of this is ensuring that the schooling system is focused on a considerable level of anti-bullying practices and eliminating instances where children have been exposed to negative attitudes merely on physically distinguishing characteristics they have. Ensuring that situations of a hostile environment and negative socialization are eliminated helps ensure that students receive the proper recognition and equal opportunities, allowing their self-confidence and perception of achievement to develop.
Meritocracy, according to Parsons, is an essential value of contemporary society. In order to evaluate the concept of meritocracy, structural factors and the way individuals are socialized through education must be considered. Meritocracy, in simple terms, can be understood as goods and power being allocated into the hands of those who have demonstrated a considerable level of performance, talent, efforts, and achievement in society. Parsons argues that people reach their positions in life through hard work rather than privilege in our society. It is part of the school's role to teach this through its formal and hidden curricula. The rewards at school are not based on titles or wealth but rather on hard work and natural ability. Moreover, this trend persists in society as a whole, with students who excel in school getting the best-paid and most responsible jobs.
As much as meritocracy would bring a considerable level of benefits to the people in the society and would mean a significant level of equality in the accessibility of resources, meritocracy is relatively difficult to achieve in society as a result of the biases seen in the education system. A crucial idea that needs to be addressed within this context is how it can be seen that in most countries, the more affluent sections of society can have higher access to quality education compared to lower-income groups. This leads to a cycle of individuals from a wealthier society with higher academic performance and merit levels that put a higher volume of goods and services in their name. As a result, although meritocracy is not a complete myth to achieve, it is rather tricky due to the educational system's biases.
