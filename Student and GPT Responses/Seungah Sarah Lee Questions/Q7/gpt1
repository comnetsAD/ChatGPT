Education and schooling can socialize individuals into society by teaching them the norms, values, beliefs, and customs of their culture, as well as the skills and knowledge necessary to function in that society. This process can shape and influence an individual's life outcomes by determining their opportunities and access to resources.

However, it's important to note that socialization is not only determined by education and schooling, but also by factors such as family, community, and culture. Additionally, the structural factors and ways in which individuals become socialized and allocated through education can often perpetuate existing inequalities, such as those based on race, class, and gender.

Meritocracy is the belief that individuals should be rewarded based on their abilities and efforts, rather than their social backgrounds. However, it is often argued that meritocracy is a myth because structural factors can limit the opportunities and resources available to individuals from marginalized groups, making it difficult for them to achieve success based on merit alone.

Overall, socialization is complex and multifaceted, and various factors, including structural inequalities, shape and influence an individual's life outcomes. While meritocracy can be a desirable concept, it is important to recognize and address the ways in which structural factors may limit opportunities and resources for marginalized groups.
