Education and schooling play a significant role in socializing individuals into society by teaching them the norms, values, and beliefs of the culture they live in. This process can shape an individual's beliefs, attitudes, and behavior, and influence their life outcomes. Socialization through education can also perpetuate societal inequalities, as certain groups of people may have less access to quality education, and therefore be at a disadvantage in terms of opportunities and life outcomes.

Meritocracy, the idea that individuals should be judged and rewarded based on their abilities and effort, may be a myth in a society where structural factors such as race, class, and gender shape an individual's access to education and opportunities. These factors can limit individuals' ability to achieve success based on merit alone, and may instead be shaped by factors outside of an individual's control. However, it's possible to strive for a meritocracy by actively working to address and reduce structural inequalities in society and education system.
