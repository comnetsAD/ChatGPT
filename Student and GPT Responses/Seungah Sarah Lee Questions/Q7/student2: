In “Privilege”, Shamus Khan demonstrates the inclusivity of schools today by illustrating that “today the school seeks to be a microcosm of our world. Rich and poor, black and white, boys and girls live in a community together” (Khan, 2011). However, this inclusivity tends to be ostensible. Due to the schools’ admission requirements which place a high emphasis on the capital that students and their families possess, the content of teaching schools offer, and the evaluation criteria they utilize which are based on the legitimization of the “dominant culture”, human capital, social capital, and cultural capital are more in the internal circulation within the dominant classes, thereby perpetuating structural inequities in society.
As illustrated in Lamont and Lareau’s article, differences in student academic performance are often explained by “differences in ability rather than by cultural resources transmitted by the family”, therefore, “social transmission of privileges is itself legitimized, for academic standards are not seen as handicapping lower class children” (Lamont & Lareau, 1988). As Bordieu indicates, those families with strong cultural capital “are more inclined to invest in their children’s education” and  “have at their disposal the means of ensuring for this capital the best academic placing for its investment”. In this way, “their academic investments cannot fail to be extremely profitable” (Bourdieu, 1977). Fifty years later, when wealthy American parents are "hiring essay coaches to help their kids write the essay, to help them edit it" (Colleges, Universities Review Standardized Tests Policies, 2022) and elite Chinese parents in big cities are competing with each other to sign up for their children's extracurricular classes, we realize that as long as schools still use standardized test grades as an important indicator for selecting students, the privilege of those families which have already held strong capital will be “concealed beneath the cloak of a perfectly democratic method of selection” (Bourdieu, 1977) and let those students from families lacking cultural capital lose in the competition of entering elite universities and accumulating human capital and social capital.
As an institution that is “officially entrusted with the transmission of the instruments of appropriations of the dominant culture which neglects methodically to transmit the instruments indispensable to the success of its undertaking”, schools tend to offer students the content of teaching that is “bound to become the monopoly of those social classes capable of transmitting by their own means” (Bourdieu, 1977). This is to say, for those social classes in a dominant position, they “legitimate the claim that specific cultural norms and practices are superior, and of institutionalizing these claims to regulate behavior and access to resources”, and “the educational system adopts them to evaluate students” (Bourdieu 1974[1966], p. 349).
Under such an evaluation system, those students from the dominant class would be more likely to win in this system because they are familiar with what is taught in schools and used as a means of assessment, which is their own culture. In contrast, students from non-ruling classes (eg immigrant students, lower class students) need to follow cultural norms with which they are unfamiliar at school. Thus, the process of exclusion Bourdieu and Passeron introduced will be likely to happen to these students. Among the four major forms of exclusion, self-elimination will make them exclude themselves because they feel that they are not familiar with the cultural norms in the school, and thus do not feel at ease and stay away from student circles who carry or are familiar with such cultural norms. An example of this can be seen in Shamus Khan's "Privilege", where he tells the story of when he first entered St. Paul thinking he "would be unlike everyone else" (Khan, 2011) and "hiding" in the minority student dorm. This will make the school environment more exclusive, as there is no real integration between those who carry cultural norms and those who don't. In this way, social capital tends to be only circulated among those students who carry cultural norms, that is, students from dominant classes.
In fact, countries are also working to introduce new education policies to combat structural inequities in society. For example, many American colleges make SAT scores optional, in order to weaken the advantage that "rich white" students have established by hiring after-school tutors. However, some people believe that although the SAT becomes optional, other reference elements of the application, such as extracurricular activities, may also require strong capital support. Therefore, it remains to be seen whether such policies can bring more equity.
