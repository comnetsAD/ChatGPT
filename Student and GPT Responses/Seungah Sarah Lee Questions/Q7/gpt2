Education and schooling play a significant role in socializing individuals into society by teaching them the norms, values, and beliefs of their culture, as well as providing them with the knowledge and skills they need to participate in the workforce and other aspects of society. The socialization experience shapes and influences an individual's life outcomes by providing them with the opportunity to acquire the knowledge, skills, and values necessary to succeed in their chosen field and by helping them to develop the social networks and relationships that can be important for achieving their goals.

However, structural factors such as poverty, discrimination, and lack of access to quality education can limit an individual's opportunities and shape their socialization experience in ways that can negatively impact their life outcomes. In this context, meritocracy, which is the belief that individuals should be rewarded based on their abilities and effort, can be difficult to achieve. While the ideal of meritocracy is often touted, it is important to recognize that structural factors and historical discrimination can create barriers to opportunity for certain groups of people, making it difficult for them to succeed based on their abilities and effort alone. Therefore, it may be more accurate to say that meritocracy is a myth or an ideal that is difficult to fully achieve in practice.
