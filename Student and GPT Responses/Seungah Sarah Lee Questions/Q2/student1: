Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory describes the significant impact of social environments in a child’s development. This framework explains that an individual child is embedded in multiple levels of environments forming concentric circles, and as a child matures, interactions with these environments shape their development and education.
 
The most immediate social context surrounding an individual in the Bronfenbrenner model is the microsystem, which consists of small, close groups and memberships such as family and peers at school. It is no surprise that, for example, parents’ aspirations for their children’s education and involvement in the process make a difference in their children’s educational outcomes. Then, there are bigger systems that indirectly surround an individual (the exosystem), such as neighborhood, parent’s workplaces and social networks, government agencies, and mass media. Parents’ aspirations and expectations for their children’s educational outcome is informed by information and networks obtained from their geographical or ethnic communities or government policies that may make education more or less accessible for the children. Similarly, children seeing a role model that shares identity with them in the community or represented in mass media can affect their educational outcomes.
 
The individual’s interaction with each system, as well as the interactions between the systems are of course informed by the broad cultural elements of the macrosystem such as socioeconomic status or race and ethnicity.
