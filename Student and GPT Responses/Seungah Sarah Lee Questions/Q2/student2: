In developed countries, families who support their children usually take education to enhance social mobility and present education as a private good that can help the child develop their career path by aiming for internationally accredited curriculums and world top universities. From Bronfenbrennerâ€™s Ecological System Theory, we can see that family has a micro-level relationship with the child, proving that it is the most influential factor in their lives which can affect their perception of education and its purpose.
 
However, in some situations, when the macrosystem in the ecological system makes parents obliged to take their kids to school, it is because of the culture and ideologies of the people around them. The GCC can be an example, and as a Bahraini citizen, I can confirm that a lot of parents support their kids to get an education, although they are uneducated, because it has become a cultural norm in such areas. In this case the parents are trying to enhance democratic equality that can let their child grow as a citizen. This shows the difference of how immediate relations and further relations in a society can affect the way a student perceives the purpose of their educational journey.
