I believe that our upbringing influences who we are, what we want, and how we identify
ourselves. Our immediate community and larger environment influences how much we perceive
ourselves as capable of achieving and how much we want and aim for in life. One way we can
see this is through the study of an individual’s short and long term academic achievements and
goals. This essay seeks to explore the effect of close relationships and larger environmental
exposure on an individual's academic performance through two theories that show up in multiple
studies.
 
First, it is important to understand the conceptual framework of what our close relationships and
larger environment means and consists of. Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory is a
model of an individual’s surroundings. It scales influential factors on human development. It
works as a simplified model of what a human is surrounded by in a snapshot of time since many
are constantly changing. Of the five “layers”, the first is the Microsystem consisting of one’s
immediate social environment including family, peers, friends, neighborhood, religious
organizations. Next is the Mesosystem consisting of extended family and the larger community
one lives. Next, the Exosystem would consist of not people but the system in which you are
exposed to. This includes the access you have to public goods like social services and health
care, and government agencies. More broadly, is the Macrosystem pertaining to attitudes,
cultures, and ideologies of one’s “world”. Lastly, are all of the environmental changes also
known as the Chronosystem. Bronfenbrenner’s Theory offers a simplified model of WHAT
factors influence an individual’s mindset through upbringing.
 
In order to answer WHY the outside environment influences us, we can observe Bourdieu’s
theory of habitus. It was briefly mentioned in a study in order to hypothesize a potential
behavioral outcome (Feliciano, et all., 2017). His theory suggests that “one’s conception of
where one fits in the social world [links to social layers of Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems
Theory] influences (an individual’s) set of dispositions, skills, and habits” and that “it is their
present and past positions in the social structure that individuals carry with them, at all times
and in all places, in the form of dispositions which are so many marks of social position”
(Feliciano, et all., 2017). His theory reinforces my argument of the fact that our upbringing
influences who we are, what we want, and how we identify ourselves.
 
In terms of taking a closer look at immediate relationships, the studies “An Immigrant Paradox?
Contextual Attainment and Intergenerational Educational Mobility” (conducted by Cynthia
Feliciano and Yader R. Lanuza) as well as “Father Involvement and Education in the Middle
East: Geography, Gender, and Generations” (by Natasha Ridge and Soohyun Jeon) offer an
insight into their effects on an individual’s academic achievements and goals in different
contexts.
 
In the study “An Immigrant Paradox? Contextual Attainment and Intergenerational Educational
Mobility” (conducted by Cynthia Feliciano and Yader R. Lanuza) the aim is to understand to
what extent the immigrant paradox is visible and if this is the case, why. Some researchers have
noted that children of immigrant parents are frequently outperforming children with native born
parents. Due to socioeconomic disadvantages they may face, it defies the prediction that they
would be able to reach such remarkable academic achievements hence the name “immigrant
paradox”. In order to challenge this concept, the study looks into nationally representative
longitudinal surveys and finds that in many cases but not all, 1.5 and second generation
immigrant children outperform native-born students academically and often achieved more
years of schooling. In terms of intergenerational mobility, the study finds that many children of
immigrants achieve higher SES than their parents (upward mobility). Conclusions of these
results derived that many children of immigrant parents are pushed due to a variety of factors.
First, it may be due to immigrant cultural ethos post-migration including: high educational
expectations, hard work, and optimism about the US opportunity structure. However, this study
looks closely into cultural resources pre-migration from parental views. Children may be pushed
due to parents having a preconceived belief in the importance of education thereby having
achieved the same years of schooling under harsher conditions in their home countries. Another
reason could be wanting to reproduce their parent’s’ pre-migration status of their home countries
to the US average. This ties into the Habitus Theory of identifying with a social status. When
that gets taken away, the family or the individual will work hard to re-achieve what once was
their norm.
 
It is also important to note the effect of the larger environment on an individual. For this two
studies can be used including one titled “Female Leadership Raises Aspirations and
Educational Attainment for Girls: A Policy Experiment in India'' (by Lori Beaman, Esther Duflo,
Rohini Pande, and Petia Topalova) as well as “Engaged Outreach: Using community
engagement to facilitate access to higher education for people from low socio-economic
backgrounds'' (by Sue Scull and Micheal Cuthill) can be used.
 
In the study of “Female Leadership Raising Aspirations of Educational Attainment for Girls”, the
aim was to identify if there is a casual relationship between the election of female leaders and
villagers aspirations. Researchers conducted their study in West Bengal since one third of
village councils are randomly selected to be reserved for a female chief counselor (combination
of adults and adolescents). Through the collection of surveys, census data, interviews,
household rosters, questionnaires, scores on the math exams, they found that due to the policy
change, females acted as role models in those positions and were able to influence more
chances by the 2nd electoral mandate. The presence of female leaders altered educational
attainment acted as a positive effect on girls' literacy.
 
Both studies researching both close social relations and larger environmental factors show that
they each have to a full extent an effect on an individual’s academic achievements and goals. In
WHAT part of the scale they lie can be categorized through Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological
Systems Theory. WHY these factors are influential relate to Bourdieu’s theory of habitus. The
analysis and breakdown of the studies dissects HOW they influence an individual. Each point
comes down to reaffirm my proposed belief that our upbringing influences who we are, what we
want, and how we identify ourselves. These small and large scale factors create a framework for
how we perceive ourselves; and in the context of this essay that means how academically
capable and ambitious we perceive ourselves to be.
