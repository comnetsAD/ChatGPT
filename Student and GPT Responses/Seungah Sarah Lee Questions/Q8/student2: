First reactions:
My first reactions of the film were pure shock, culture shock. I had never seen so much chaos in a classroom, but it seemed like that was the norm for the students to be in a chaotic school environment. I could not believe the way the teachers were disrespected and how there was no actual learning taking place due to the constant commotion.
 
What is happening at the school, and why is it happening?
At the school chairs are being thrown, school property being damaged, and people being physically assaulted. Since it is a boys only school, it seems as their behavior is not really being dealt with but reinforced by the teachers’ self-fulfilling prophecies. Teachers expect students to rebel and misbehave, so they do. The children are far too rebellious and distracted to learn, and teachers are too busy trying to deal with the commotion to teach.
 
What themes from class readings are reflected in the film?
 
In the reading ‘Father involvement and Education in the Middle East’, we are introduced to the long-lived norms in the Middle East of the mother being the parent who takes care of her children’s up brining and education. While the father’s role is to work and provide for the family. The authors claim that “This has resulted in schools becoming gender segregated spaces which exclude the opposite-sex parent from a son or daughter’s education—anecdotally, leaving boys without either parent involved in their education” (Ridge, Jeon, 729). The fact that parents are not involved in their children’s education reduces the child’s sense of importance for education. This eventually leads to them not putting much effort into their studies and can result in low grades, or them dropping out of school altogether. In Bader and his classmates’ case, this has caused them to dismiss studying and just to act inappropriately because they consider that fun. These actions are attention seeking actions, they want to be cared about and looked at. So, if parents and teachers are not getting involved, the children will continue to rebel to receive the attention they won’t receive otherwise. Ridge and Jeon have also asserted that the involvement of fathers specifically would lead to the student’s higher attainment, the student is also more likely to enjoy school, be better behaved and achieve A grades. Therefore, if parents were more involved in their children’s education, they would be better behaved and would not completely dismiss education.
 
Furthermore, in the reading ‘The Role of Classroom Resources…’, the authors explore the effectiveness of classroom resources and how that can contribute to the improvement of education. They come to the conclusion that “school resources make major contributions to student learning gain...The fact that increasing teacher skills and teaching quality can influence student outcomes is important” (229). Through proper staff employment, it is more likely that the students would behave better if the staff are strict with their values and expectations. Staff that do not quickly give up on their students are important to have in this case. Dealing with just one student’s misbehavior can have a domino effect on their peers and they would also start behaving better and taking their time at school more seriously.
 
Solutions and what can be done at:
1) 	The classroom level:
Teachers should discipline children to stop them from misbehaving, trying other forms of punishment/ discipline instead of making them crawl on their fronts in the playground only to get their clothes dirty, or suspending them. Their behavior should be addressed and dealt with not ignored and pushed aside. Children would take those two days of suspension as a holiday or days off, not to reflect on what they did.
Setting expectations for children and how they should act in the school environment is very important. This would give students a sort of guideline as to how they should act and what is expected of them once they are at school.
Signaling students is also another way to capture attention, whether that is through clapping or an attention-grabbing word that they are trained to respond to, students would give their almost immediate attention and settle down.
2) 	The school level:
Eliminating teachers that are ineffective would be more beneficial for the students.
However, reemploying teachers is expensive and could be ineffective, so instead, schools could train their existing staff since they are already familiar with the students and their struggles. Schools could provide training for staff to teach them how to deal with classroom conflicts to prevent students from misbehaving.
The school environment is also highly important when it comes to taking the school seriously, changes such as newly painted walls, and new desks that are not vandalized can show students that the school is investing in their resources and investing in the students and that they expect them to do better as well.
3) 	The community level:
Communities can provide playgrounds and extra curriculars that could be of interest to students so that they can use their energy in other ways rather than rebelling in class. The more the children are focused on what they like rather than what they don’t, the less likely they are to cause a ruckus in class. For Bader specifically, his hobby is creating and reciting poetry, so putting his energy and time into that can turn him into a more well behaved student.
Also, through finding a role model or someone to look up to, students would naturally change their behaviors to mimic or reflect that of their role model. Like we saw in the reading: ‘Female Leadership Raises Aspirations and Educational Attainment for Girls’, having a role model can change the person’s aspirations and could result in them being more interested in school so that they can reach their goals and aspirations.
Furthermore, having talks that educate parents on the importance of their involvement and how they could help their children study, could improve the student’s grades when they see how important it is to their parents and it would, in turn, become important to them as well.
