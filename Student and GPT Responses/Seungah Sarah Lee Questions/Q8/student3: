“Bader” is a short film documentary produced in 2012 revolving around a young 4th grade Qatari student. The young boy is shown in the ten minute short film to be involved in a lot of “trouble making” activitiesat school. In the short amount of time we see some character development where he explains that poetry
has a large influence on his life and creates positive behavioral change. The observational film went on to
win multiple awards in the “mini-documentary” field due to its humanization and personal insight into a
culture and part of the world often portrayed negatively and in a dehumanizing way in the media.
 
The short film also does an excellent job at shedding light on the themes discussed in class. Teachers and the larger educational context have a great impact on a student's learning and academic performance in school. First, it is important to break down the influence of teachers on students. Second, is understanding the influence of other surroundings (Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory) on a student. With that information, a solution can be derived for what, in Bader’s case, would have helped increase academic performance and behavioral discipline earlier on.
 
First, research shows that teachers have a large influence on a student’s academic success. A student can resonate with a likable teacher who may be seen as a mentor and aspire to perform well in their class. A student could also be discouraged or not care about the teacher resulting in them not trying to perform well in their class (Ladd 2009). In order to ensure higher academic performance, it has also been proven that when a teacher is knowledgeable about the field that they are teaching, that the students spend more time on the subject and therefore have a better understanding of the topic (Ladd 2009). This argument can be seen in the short film through the fact that Bader did not care about his teachers. He did rebellious things to them and it did not particularly matter to him what they thought of him. This may be due to the fact that he could not relate to them or did not see a benefit in obeying them. It was also discussed that this discipline lacked at home and its lack thereof was therefore normalized at school. Teachers then had little chance of getting through to the students since they did not have respect and did not care for discipline in the first place. At this point, it is not relevant how much the teacher knows about
the subject if the basics can’t be covered in class due to the disruptive behavior of the students.
 
Second, it is important to understand that teachers are not the only influence on a student’s academic performance. Bronfenbrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory discusses the variety of levels of influence on
an individual at a specific point in time. One significant factor is a student’s friends and family. When the family is supportive and creates discipline, the child will obey what is prioritized in that household (academia, respect, tolerance, patience…). Different social, economic, political and cultural realities influence a child's upbringing as well as teacher quality and classroom experience.
 
As previously mentioned, it was briefly discussed that parents at home did not discipline their children which led to rebellious behavior at school. However, this could be countered by the fact that Bader discussed a further lecture he received by his older brother. His brother said “you are a man now”, which impacted how Bader saw himself and changed his behavior. Perhaps he looks up to his older brother or what/how his brother communicated got through to him. Regardless, his immediate circle has an influence on his own identity and therefore influences his behavior and academic performance.
 
In order to discipline the behavioral problem and improve academic performance of this school, I came up with three solutions. I believe one solution would be that teachers discuss with other teachers their strategies or views when it comes to teaching their students. Training is often efficient but expensive
which is why this solution could help. Another way to improve behavior and academic performance is through the inclusion of teachers that the students look up to. When they see their role models acting in a behavior desired by the school, they will model it because they identify and look up to the person. Lastly, I believe that if the teachers went out of their way to show that they cared, the students would be influenced. It would have to be in a specific way, and the student would first have to have a lot of respect for the teachers. However, with this consideration, students would feel cared for and may consider readjusting their behavior after knowing that it matters to someone outside of their home.
 
In order to identify if the solutions were effective or not, the credentials and value-added models can be used. In the field of math, research shows that “teacher credentials are sufficiently large to offset the estimated effects of low parental education on student achievement” (Ladd 2009). Value-Added models compare test scores of students in a teacher's class compared to those of previous years and thereby isolate the findings of the teacher’s contributions. It is important that teachers that influence high academic achievement and better behavioral discipline can be identified. This is because they are large contributing factors for high academic achievement and their practices can be integrated by other teachers in order to positively influence many other students.
 
Bader is one of many students coming from a similar background and outputting common behaviors. A
continuation of this system is inefficient since it sets up students to fall behind academically on a global
scale. Teachers and immediate close contacts have the power and potential to change the behavior of
