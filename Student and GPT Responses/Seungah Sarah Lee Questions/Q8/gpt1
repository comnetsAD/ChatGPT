My initial reaction to watching the short-film Bader is that it highlights the cultural and linguistic challenges that the young Qatari boy, Bader, faces in his elementary school. It appears that he is struggling to navigate the cultural and linguistic differences between his home culture and the dominant culture of the school, which is primarily English-speaking. This highlights the importance of cultural and linguistic sensitivity and inclusivity in the education system.

In terms of why things are the way they are, it is possible that the school is not adequately addressing the needs of students from non-dominant cultures and languages. This could be due to a lack of resources, training, or understanding on the part of school staff and administrators. Additionally, societal attitudes and beliefs about language and culture may also contribute to this problem.

In terms of addressing the challenges faced by boys like Bader, some recommendations that could be implemented at the classroom, school, and community levels include:

Providing bilingual or multilingual education: This could include offering language classes for non-dominant languages, as well as hiring teachers and staff who are proficient in multiple languages.
Cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff: This would help to ensure that school staff are aware of and sensitive to the cultural and linguistic needs of all students.
Community engagement and outreach: This could involve working with community organizations and leaders to involve parents and families in the education process, which can help to build trust and understanding between the school and the community.
Inclusive teaching strategies: This could include using inclusive teaching methods, such as the use of real-world examples, and active learning to build a more inclusive learning environment.
