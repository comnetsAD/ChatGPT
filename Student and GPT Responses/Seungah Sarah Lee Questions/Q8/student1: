The short-film Bader has a multitude of aspects, issues, and situations regarding the learning and integration process of students into the school environment, that can be analyzed from various perspectives. While a first look at the clip would give an initial reaction associated with a superficial thought that everything seems to be chaotic, messy, and wrong in an elementary school for boys in Qatar, a much more complex analysis should be conducted to understand why some issues exist and seem to persist in the school environment. While there are various aspects that need to be addressed, this paper will reflect only on three important points: the interaction between students and teachers, interaction among peers, and the inclusion of family in students’ behavioral and academic progress. On top of that, this paper seeks to offer some potential recommendations regarding the interaction among different actors. These recommendations will conclude in two major aspects: the need for resources, and distributive leadership, which will be discussed in the last part of the paper.
 
One of the first aspects that can be easily identified in the interaction between students and teachers, is the continuous tension, both on an academic level and in daily normal interaction. In the video, the struggle that teachers experience when having to calm students down is noticeable. Sometimes, it seems that students are creating so much trouble such as jumping over the window to enter the class, ripping their exams, skipping classes, and locking teachers outside, that it can become very overwhelming for teachers to maintain their calmness and control over the situation. This often results in more aggressive behavior from the teachers’ side, characterized by a lot of screaming and shouting, and a more severe reward-punishment method. While this approach could work sometimes, I personally believe that it can lead to unintended negative effects on students’ progress. For instance, I found the scene when the teacher wrote ‘You are a failure’ (Al-Saadi et al., 2012) on one of the student's notebooks to be too extreme. Given that these students are in elementary school, they are at an age when they develop many cognitive assumptions regarding their position in different types of environments, such as the school one. A statement like this could create a negative persistent assumption about one’s self-confidence and self-esteem.
 
Many papers, including the ones discussed in class, talk about students’ academic performance based on teachers’ professional background, such as teachers’ credentials. However, fewer papers talk about the nature of the student-teacher relations. In the chapter ‘Organizing School for Improvement’, the authors reflect on the importance of teachers’ knowledge about their students’ backgrounds (2015). At the psychosocial level, by knowing and understanding students’ backgrounds, such as their culture, family situation, hobbies, skills, and interests, teachers can forge strong connections with students, which can have a significant impact on their progress and advancement in academic learning (2015). While this sounds beautiful, it is much more difficult to effectively measure and evaluate the nature of the teacher-student relation. Moreover, a more complex recruitment process of teachers should exist that would not only evaluate teachers’ knowledge and hard skills but also their soft and interpersonal skills. In this case, the leadership of the school should make sure that the school has consistent, efficient methods for evaluating teachers’ progress, as well as the possibility to provide teachers with any resources and materials needed to effectively use and improve their teaching and interpersonal skills.
 
A second aspect important to consider is the interaction between students. Ethnic, national, and racial identity seems to have a strong influence on the bonds created among students. One teacher explained how sometimes teachers use tribe names to encourage students to listen and behave nicely with each other. However, sometimes this can represent an issue of discrimination, that can negatively impact students’ integration and socialization into the school environment. One of the students is clearly disturbed when he shares the discriminatory comments made by some of his peers: ’hey Salem, you black guy!’, ‘Why do they pick on them (dark-skinned boys)? We’re all equal in God's eyes.’ (Al-Saadi et al., 2012). From the video, it seems that the problem is not really addressed at the school level. Teachers might ask students to be polite and respectful and refrain from using inappropriate, disturbing words. However, this does not really have consistent, proper results, as the bullying around skin color, ethnicity, and nationality still persists. One of the ideal solutions, in this case, would be the creation of a supportive peer system (Bryk et al., 2015), that would influence students’ behaviors and way of thinking, through the embedded cultural, social, collective ‘hidden’ norms. However, while this is a ‘powerful social control mechanism’ (Bryk et al., 2015: 627), it can be very difficult to achieve, as there are many more factors and actors in charge of the creation of these social and cultural norms, from teachers, and the school environment, to the family, community, and nation values, attitudes, and ideologies. This further emphasizes the complexity of Bronfenbrenner's Ecological Systems Theory, which shows how deep the ‘hidden part of the iceberg’ is and how difficult to reach, let alone to change, can be.
 
Another crucial aspect is the parental ties with both students and the school’s staff. The video presents the situation in which the principal calls the father of one of the students to report his problematic behavior. Students also explain how they are usually punished by their parents for the problems they create in school. One of the students explains how after having a ‘long’ conversation with his brother, he became more obedient, and as a reward, the school called his parents to thank them for how his behavior changed for the better. In many readings and class discussions, we talked about parents’, and teachers’ expectations of students’ performance, both academic and behavioral. While Ridge and Jeon argue that father involvement plays a significant role in their sons’ educational attainment, which means that the more the father is involved, the higher expectations he has towards his son(s) (2020), this could also be reflected in students’ behavior at school. The interviewed student explained how his brother told him that he should behave like a man: ‘You’re a man. You shouldn’t be acting like this’ (Al-Saadi et al., 2012). This further suggests the expectations family members have of their children and how these expectations impact their everyday interactions. Priorities regarding children’s education, especially boys’ education as we saw in the article on ‘Father Involvement and Education in the Middle East’, can vary, and this variation influences the way boys behave in school. It has been shown that fathers are perceived to be more encouraging of their daughters’ education than their sons’, especially in the case of fathers from the GCC (Ridge&Jeon, 2020). This might offer a possible explanation for why male students tend to create more trouble in the elementary school from the film in Qatar, but this shall be further explored. A potential solution would be a better engagement of parents and families in their children’s educational and behavioral attainment (Bryk et al., 2015). This could be further realized through the planning of collective events, and through clear, constant communication channels between the school leadership and the parents.
 
A crucial aspect that each potential recommendation/solution offered in the above situations presents is the fact that the school needs resources, and distributive leadership to make proper use of the resources. The need for resources, such as financial resources to organize collective events for parents and school staff, to improve the recruitment process of teachers, and to offer them pedagogical materials so that they can run more interactive lectures and strengthen their relationships with the students, is pivotal. However, these financial resources should come from higher institutions such as regional education inspectorates and governments. This presents a problem at a higher institutional level, which burdens, even more, the possibility of implementing these recommendations. This can be further translated into a problem of equity, as we saw in the video with Obama’s speech, who promised to offer funds only to the schools that
would achieve impartial requirements, that many disadvantaged schools might not be able to satisfy. On the other hand, distributive leadership is one of the major factors that, according to Bryk et al., made a significant difference in the school’s progress and future (2015). The principal and a group of committed, devoted faculty and staff members should take action and envision a fruitful future for the growth, improvement, and development of the boys' elementary school from the clip. Without distributive leadership, none of these initiatives, and recommendations could work, as there would be no sustainability, consistency, and innovation.
 
In conclusion, the case of the boys' elementary school in Qatar emphasized the fact that education issues are no longer only education issues. There are various factors that can lead to unintended consequences and that can burden the overall desired process and outcome, as well as various actors that need to be considered when reflecting on and designing solutions to some of the most urgent education problems.
