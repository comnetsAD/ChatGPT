Based on the short-film "Bader", my initial reaction is one of empathy for the young Qatari boy and the challenges he faces in his elementary school. The film highlights the cultural and linguistic barriers he experiences as a non-native English speaker in a classroom where English is the primary language of instruction. Additionally, the film also touches on the theme of cultural identity and the pressure Bader feels to conform to the westernized norms of his school environment, while struggling to maintain connection to his own cultural heritage.

To address these challenges, there are a few recommendations that could be considered at the classroom, school, and community levels. At the classroom level, providing additional support for non-native English speakers such as bilingual or ESL (English as a Second Language) instruction can help to bridge the language barrier and improve academic outcomes for students like Bader. Additionally, incorporating cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff can help create a more inclusive and understanding classroom environment.

At the school level, creating opportunities for cultural exchange and understanding, such as cultural fairs or guest speakers, can promote a greater appreciation and understanding of different cultural backgrounds and experiences. Furthermore, actively seeking out and involving parents and community members from diverse backgrounds in the school community can help create a more inclusive and welcoming environment.

At the community level, providing resources and support for families to maintain and strengthen their cultural heritage and identity, such as language classes or cultural activities, can help to support the cultural identity of children like Bader. Additionally, working to address and challenge any structural inequalities that may exist in the community, such as discrimination or marginalization, can help to create a more equitable and inclusive society for all.
