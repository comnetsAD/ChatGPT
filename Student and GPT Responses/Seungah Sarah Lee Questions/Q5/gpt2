Philosophers and theorists of education would likely have different explanations and arguments for the importance of education in a country or community that may not necessarily value it or want to opt-out of the modern education system in favor of non-formal alternatives.

Functionalists would argue that education is essential for the functioning of society and the economy. They would argue that education is a key factor in socialization, preparing individuals for roles in society and promoting social stability. They would also argue that education is necessary for economic growth and development, as it provides individuals with the skills and knowledge needed to participate in the workforce.

Conflict theorists would argue that education is a tool of social control, used to maintain the power of dominant groups and reproduce social inequality. They would argue that the education system is designed to benefit those in power and keep marginalized groups in their place. They would also argue that non-formal alternatives are often not truly alternatives, as they are often underfunded and under-resourced, which means they continue to reproduce inequality.

Institutionalists would argue that the education system is a social institution that plays a critical role in shaping individuals and society. They would also argue that education is important for the development of critical thinking, civic engagement, and social cohesion. They would also argue that non-formal education alternatives may have their own limitations, such as lack of accreditation, less access to resources and support, and may not be as effective in providing the necessary skills and knowledge for individuals to fully participate in society.

Personally, I don’t have a theoretical framework to favor, but considering the different perspectives above, one could argue that education is essential for the functioning of society and the economy and that it is necessary for economic growth and development, as it provides individuals with the skills and knowledge needed to participate in the workforce. However, it’s also important to acknowledge that the education system can perpetuate social inequality and that non-formal alternatives should be supported and made accessible as well. Therefore, efforts should be made to make the education system more inclusive, equitable and responsive to the diverse needs of different communities.
