Functionalists would argue that education is an important aspect of a country or community as it serves a vital social function by providing individuals with the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to function in society. They would argue that education is necessary for the smooth functioning of society and that it is essential for the maintenance of social order. They would also argue that education provides individuals with the opportunity to improve their social and economic status, which ultimately benefits the entire community.

Conflict theorists would argue that education is important in a country or community because it serves to reproduce social and economic inequality. They would argue that the education system is controlled by powerful interest groups, such as the government and businesses, and that it is designed to benefit these groups at the expense of marginalized and oppressed groups. They would argue that education is used as a tool to maintain the existing power structures in society, and that it is essential to challenge these structures in order to promote social change and equality.

Institutionalists would argue that education is important because it is an institution that is deeply ingrained in society and that it is essential for the maintenance of social norms and values. They would argue that education is a crucial aspect of socialization, teaching students the norms and values that are considered desirable in a particular culture. They would also argue that education is an important aspect of social reproduction, as it provides individuals with the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed to function in society and to reproduce the existing social and economic structures.

Personally, I would say that from a conflict theorist perspective, education is important in a country or community because it serves as a means to challenge and ultimately change the existing power structures that perpetuate social and economic inequality. Education is a powerful tool that can be used to promote social change and empower marginalized and oppressed groups. While non-formal alternatives may be valuable, it is important to recognize that the modern education system is often controlled by powerful interest groups and that it can perpetuate these inequalities. Therefore, a critical examination of the education system and the power dynamics within it is necessary in order to promote true equality and social justice.
