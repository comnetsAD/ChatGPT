The impact of education through the lens of Functionalism and Conflict theory While it is clear that education has a significant impact on people's lives and society as a whole, sociologists have many different perspectives on this impact. In this response paper I will be analyzing the two theoretical viewpoints of functionalism and social conflict theory to address the question and understand what is the relationship between formal education, skill acquisition, and occupational status.
 
Since conflict theorists see education as a way to exacerbate social inequality, functionalists believe that education equips people to fulfill various functional roles in society. According to functionalism, among other things, schools may influence society through fostering social cohesion and teaching skills that are applicable to today's dynamic society. A fundamental approach is based in a functional perspective is that at any given time within the labor force, a “fixed set of positions' ' exists (Collins, 1971). Which means that Who will be chosen for these roles is ultimately determined by this set need. Individuals seek advanced and specialized technical training and abilities in order to enter higher-level employment, of which there are few, and stratification into the hierarchy of roles is related to obtained levels of formal education. As Parson mentioned, more prestigious positions require higher and more specialized training, and the function of the educational system is to sort and select individuals according to their abilities (Parsons, 1959). On the other hand, conflict theory views education as having the objective of preserving social inequality and the power of the privileged minority. As Collins postulated, from a conflict perspective, “education should be most important where two conditions hold simultaneously: (1) the type of education most closely reflects membership in a particular status group, and (2) that group controls employment in particular organizational contexts” (Collins, 1971). In addition Kahl states that the conflict theory explains that the focus of education or schools is to maintain the social inequality in the society and further protect the power of those who rule society( Kahl, 1957). This implies that because the decision-making in the national interest falls to a small group ruling class, this leads inequality among the population of the
society to grow even further.
 
Given that schools are an integral part of society, sociological viewpoints can be used to interpret how they contribute to social change. Jayaram mentioned in his book Sociology of Education in India that Functionalism suggests that the major function of education is the transmission of society's norms and values from one generation to the next (Jayaram, 2001). Through a functionalist theoretical view, education can influence society to adopt new behavioral norms. For instance, huge gender inequality existed in Ethiopia before the country became a democratic, and the culture at the time accepted it as normal. Women were expected to be obedient to men rather than assume leadership positions in the community. But the way that society views how women should be treated has changed as a result of the educational system. Ethiopia has seen substantial progress in gender empowerment, most notably with the achievement of 22.1 percent female representation in Parliament in 2005 as compared to 7.7 percent in 2000 and similar high levels of female representation at all levels of governance (FDRE, 2006). This emphasizes that the school has the power to influence society's norms and values, either by educating students about the value of adopting new norms and values or by preserving them through discussing the development of a particular culture and its various social constructs. In countered , Haralambos and Holborn claim that the values and norms in the society can be changed through the school system by doing so to gain experience rather than being told (Haralambos & Holborn, 2000). This indicates that society will grow in this way, gaining information as well as the abilities, routines, and attitudes required to deal with a variety of issues. Individuals will also be able to develop the capacity for critical thought about their environment. Which means that the students must use what they have learned as soon as possible for it to be meaningful; they must also practice discipline as well as understand its repercussions.
 
Overall, these two major sociological theories offer insight into how we understand education. Functionalists see education as serving the needs of society by preparing students for later roles, or functions, in society whereas Conflict theorists believe that schools as a means for perpetuating class, racial-ethnic, and gender inequalities.
