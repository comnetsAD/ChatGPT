The conflict theory developed by Karl Marx suggests unceasing competition between distinct social classes, as they have antagonistic interests and compete for limited resources. Class conflict is ubiquitous in the arena of education, where the dominant class in the capitalist society implicitly and explicitly insert their influence over less privileged groups, consolidating and reinforcing economic and educational inequality generated by capitalism (Greave et al., p.39). Based on the Marxian theoretical framework and referring to the cultural capital theory and social mobility goal of education, this paper will analyze the role and function of education and argue that increasingly capitalist education reinforces class struggles and social stratification. Specifically, K-12 education implicitly disadvantages lower-class students through the shadow education market and discriminatory hidden curriculum, whereas the commodification of higher education explicitly rejects students from less favorable backgrounds.
 
Following World War II and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1948, most modern nations agreed on the importance of education as a human right and a means to produce productive workers. As a result, there has been a considerable expansion in public spending on K-12 education, especially on primary education, to boost literacy and equal access to education and the resultant economic opportunities (OECD). While the goal of universal access to primary education has been largely accomplished, as the enrollment in primary education in developing countries reached 91% in 2015 (United Nations), educational inequality only persists, and economic inequality is exacerbated. Despite the state provision of mass schooling, the private shadow education and class-discriminatory hidden curriculum severely hinder the schooling experiences and outcomes of non-dominant class students.
 
The emergence of the shadow education market is a powerful, explicit manifestation of class conflicts in education. In the fierce competition to a handful of selective institutions, the middle and upper classes utilize their economic resources to hire private tutors, allowing their children to succeed academically, which is found to be highly correlated and possibly causal with higher lifetime earnings (OECD).
 
There have been governmental efforts to prevent such unfair advantages, but most ended up being little effective or futile. The Double Reduction Reform in China demonstrates the difficulties in removing economic inequality and social stratification in education. Following this draconian policy aiming at easing the excessive competition among K-12 students, all off-campus tutoring institutions had to shut down within a few weeks. However, as the high-stake national entrance exam Gaokao is still in place, anxious parents had to seek recourse from expensive black market tutors or sacrifice their work to tutor the student at home, actions requiring the parents to either pay greater economic rents or be well educated. On the contrary, lower-class families lost access to relatively affordable shadow education, which potentially enlarges the educational gap between social classes (Jin, p.771).
 
Another implicit form of class conflict is the class discriminatory hidden curriculum. According to Bourdieu, dominant (or legitimate) cultural capital is the values of the dominant social class that facilitate social reproduction and discourage social mobility. As a complementary concept, non-dominant (or illegitimate) cultural capital is also widely discussed in educational sociology literature, implying the cultural values accepted and respected in non-dominant classes (Carter, p.147). These two sets of values are often non-compatible, thus leading to various forms of exclusion, such as self-elimination and over-selection, towards the lower class students.
 
Measures to eliminate the effects of dominant cultural capital, such as considerations for socioeconomic backgrounds in college admissions, are not uncommon. However, many deep-rooted problems in schooling are often overlooked. Students from lower classes are often discriminated against in an array of ways. School curriculums and admissions tests designed for the dominant social group require students from minorities to make an extra effort (Wildhagen, p.173). Middle- or upper-middle-class teachers tend to be biased toward their social origins and be less understanding to students exhibiting different status attributes (Alexander et al., p.665-682). Even if the teacher is originally from a less privileged background, there is a high chance that they adopt the dominant values as they go through post-secondary education (Hurst).
 
While schooling until lower secondary education is commonly made compulsory, due to the implicit hardships, discouraging schooling experience, and family constraints, higher education becomes predominantly occupied by middle and upper-class students. Higher education is where we observe rampant privatization and commodification of education. Contrary to the relatively stable public spending on K-12 education, state funding for post-secondary education experiences deep cuts in many developed countries, a phenomenon attributable to the glorified myth of neoliberalism and privatization. For instance, emulating the US, many Canadian universities have started to adopt the user-fee model, charging students against their future earnings and expecting low-income students to take on debts for college education (Fanelli, 2013). Even if limited financial aid assistance is available to some low-income students, withdrawing government subsidies will still create significant financial burdens and accrue opportunity costs.
 
In addition to increased tuition burdens for low-income students, privatized, profit-seeking higher education institutions also cut funding from non-business-oriented subjects. Fundings for departments such as women’s and cultural studies, labor-capital studies, and political economy are significantly axed (Fanelli et al., 2015). It is ironic to observe that the subjects that guide us to think critically about the alarming expansion of capitalism are now gradually being erased from the market-driven world. If, one day, the social mobility goal of education completely overwrites the others and critical thinking is abandoned, how can we intellectually engage with society again?
 
The current educational policy trends can have profound implications on class dynamics. With high enrollment in K-12 education but highly commodified post-secondary education reserved for the elites, the educational system consolidates the existing class structure, reproducing a large, sufficiently educated reserve army of labor and inherent high position workers and capitalists. Resources are allocated to where cultural and social capitals concentrate (e.g., business-related subjects and STEM subjects, both requiring high cultural capital and high-quality teaching at the K-12 stage), and studies related to the life of non-dominant classes (e.g., labor-capital studies and cultural studies) are collectively ignored.
 
While the proponents claim that capitalist education promotes efficiency and social mobility (Cox, p.16), this statement remains questionable in light of empirical sociological findings. As Kumar (2015) points out, “Education is more than formal institutional structures and classroom transactions. It is an arena that reflects the agenda and need of the dominant class interest in a society.” I would add that this role of education is especially prominent in a society blindly conforming to neoliberalism norms, and thus, governments need to realize the danger of further commodification of education and recognize the other crucial functions of education beside producing money-generating social credentials.
