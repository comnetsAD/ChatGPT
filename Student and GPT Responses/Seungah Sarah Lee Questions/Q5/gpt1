From a functionalist perspective, education is seen as an important institution that serves the needs of society as a whole by providing a literate and skilled workforce, promoting social cohesion, and reproducing social and economic inequality. Therefore, even in a country or community that may not necessarily value education, it is important to ensure that all individuals have access to educational opportunities to fulfill their roles in society and contribute to the functioning of the community as a whole.

From a conflict theorist perspective, education is seen as a tool for maintaining and reproducing social and economic inequality. In a country or community where education may not be valued, individuals with access to educational opportunities may be able to use that access to gain power and privilege over others. Therefore, for those who may want to opt-out of the modern education system in favor of non-formal alternatives, it is important to examine how the education system is being used as a tool for maintaining inequality, and to work towards creating more equitable alternatives.

From an institutionalist perspective, education is seen as a cultural and social practice that is shaped by the interests and values of those in power. In a country or community where education may not be valued, it is important to understand how the education system is shaped by the interests and values of those in power and how it may be reproducing unequal power relations. Therefore, for those who may want to opt-out of the modern education system in favor of non-formal alternatives, it is important to examine the cultural and social practices that shape the education system and work towards creating more democratic and inclusive alternatives.

Personally, I am more drawn to the institutionalist perspective. Education is shaped by the cultural and social practices of the society, and it is important to understand how it is shaped by the interests and values of those in power. In a country or community where education may not be valued, it is important to understand how the education system is reproducing unequal power relations and to work towards creating more democratic and inclusive alternatives that align with the values and needs of the community.
