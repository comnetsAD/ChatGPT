This paper seeks to explain why parents and hiring entities in the UAE prefer private education
institutions over public ones, through the lens of the Technical-Function Theory of Education
and the Conflict Theory of Educational Stratification. While the two theories have different
approaches, the latter one being more preferred in the academic field, this paper will demonstrate that both of them can be applied in the private versus public education context of the UAE.
 
Before diving into the analysis of the two theories, it is important to have an understanding of
how the education system works in the UAE, and the perceptions people have towards it. The
education system consists primarily of public and private institutions. Private schools have many characteristics that set them apart from the government-operated ones. Unlike the public schools whose curriculum is designed by the Ministry of Education, the private sector has a variety of curricula, Abu Dhabi including 14 different ones, the American and British being the most preferred (Joining K-12 Education - the Official Portal of the UAE Government, n.d.). Private schools usually charge much higher tuition, while public schools are more affordable. Yet, public education is free only for Emirati citizens, excluding the expat population, which has to pay the tuition fee.
 
Given these differences, it is interesting to observe people’s perceptions towards attending each of these institutions. Many Emirati parents would prefer to send their children to private schools, as they believe that this will not only provide their children with a better education suited for the market’s demands, but also because private schools offer a higher social status in the community (Emiratis Choosing Private Education Over Public Schools (NEWS), 2011). Moreover, studies have shown that parents reported a significant lack of confidence and an increased shyness level for their children who were enrolled in public schools (Paul, 2018). In a blog article written by Mira Al-Hussein, it is depicted how Emiratis graduating from federal universities experience the harsh reality of not being able to get into better-paid, prestigious, dream jobs, as their colleagues holding degrees from private or overseas universities take most of their chances (2021).
 
Functional theory and conflict theory can be used to better understand the social phenomena of choosing private education institutions over public ones, given the perceptions of parents and employers. One reason why companies operating in the UAE are more prone to hire graduates from private universities, is because they trust private universities more in better equipping students with the necessary skills and knowledge, given the ongoing technological advancements, which illustrates the core of the functional theory, that skill requirements have increased because of technological change (Arum et al., 2015). Moreover, as the human capital entails, countries with a greater number of educated people lead to economic growth (Arum et al., 2015). No wonder the UAE is one of the most technologically advanced countries in the Gulf region, as it looks to hire only the best, most skillful employees in the highest positions. This can also be seen in the great number of private universities in Abu Dhabi, Sharjah, and Dubai, compared to other countries in the Middle East.
 
While the Functional theory offers a pretty straightforward explanation of the phenomena, the Conflict theory of stratification brings a more sociological, complex understanding. Collins makes a great argument when he states that employers select their employees by looking at the way they have been socialized into the dominant status culture (Arum et al., 2015). In this case, the dominant status culture mostly represents people coming from prestigious institutions, where graduating students not only gain the necessary skills, but they also learn and adopt specific attitudes and behaviors, a cultural capital highly valued among the hiring elites.
 
However, it would not be fair to say that public schools and public universities do not have any value. The training practices might be less efficient but they do as well offer students the ability to gain skills and knowledge useful for the world’s economy. It is, unfortunately, the reputation of the private education entities that bring more value to the table. In the case of a Syrian refugee settled in the UAE, despite having a university degree in accounting from Jordan, and being an operations manager for a local company, he was unemployed for nine months when came to the UAE, because his degree and experience in Jordan were not recognized by any company in the Emirates (citation). One of the main reasons why parents send their children to private schools, because ‘It’s the kind of children that I want my son to be around’ (Emiratis Choosing Private Education Over Public Schools (NEWS), 2011) speaks so much volumes of the dominant status culture that can easily take away the equal and equitable chances of people who might not have the resources to become ‘members’ of the dominant culture, but whose potential might be fit or even bigger than of those privileged enough to be part of the elite groups.
 
This paper tried to explain the reasons why people choose private education institutions over public ones through the Functional and Conflict theories, with a focus on human and cultural capital. It has been shown that the Conflict theory might better explain the social phenomena of favoring private education, as the dominant status culture has a much bigger influence over people’s perspectives. Moreover, the unequal and inequitable characteristics of the education system in the UAE contributed to the formation and continuation of this dominant culture, as it excludes people with great talent who might not have the required economic and social resources to be members of this culture.
