The prevalence of state-sponsored mass education and the sociocultural importance put on the education systems are so widely observed across the increasingly globalized modern world society that it could be stated that, “almost everywhere, education is made compulsory and universal by national law, often in the national constitution” (Boli-Bennett 1976, as cited in Meyer, 1977, p. 641). This essay considers the modern educational system, specifically in the globally standard form of state-sponsored mass education, and explores the origin, significance, and purpose of the institution of education.
 
Ramirez and Boli (1987) find the roots of the modern framework of state-sponsored mass education in the late eighteenth and nineteenth centuries Europe. According to the authors, the modern concept of mass education emerged as a legitimizing institution for the novel construction of unified national polity that was the nation-state, amidst the European period of large-scale social transformation. Under the rapid changes in culture, polity, and economy, newly established nation-states showed similar responses to the challenges to state power, which was declaring state authority over education systems and establishing ministries and legislatures to make education compulsory (pp. 3, 9). Such a pattern was based on the rising secular individualism, or the recognition of “the individual as the primary unit of action and fundamental source of value in society” (p. 10). That is, emerging nation-states widely adopted the logic that national development is contingent on individual development, and individual development is contingent on childhood socialization which raises loyal and productive adult citizens. The nineteenth century European model of the modern educational system was “designed to achieve unity and progress” within a nation-state (p. 11).
 
Meyer (1977), in consideration of what education achieves and why it is so important in the modern context, emphasizes that modern mass education is institutionalized, being composed of systems of classifications regulated and enforced by the state (p. 641). By conceptualizing the modern education system as an institution and not simply a set of processes of socializing individuals, institutional theory of education recognizes education’s significance in shaping social structure itself. Meyer argues that the nationally institutionalized mass education “legitimizes” a nation-state and the common reality of its people. That is, it constructs assumptions of a collective national culture around common language, history, and natural and logical reality, as well as shared definition of citizenships, civic order, and rights (p. 644). In the era of globalization, education also instills common definitions of global citizenship and fundamental human rights, which means when individual states align their systems of education to this model, it signals to the global society that they are legitimate modern states that share the world culture of education. Such legitimizing effects are why state-sponsored mass education is so significant for any nation-state in the global sphere, and thus so prevalent and widely adopted.
 
In Ramirez and Boli’s (1987) as well as Meyer’s (1977) approach to the model of modern education, national development is the key purpose, and state—as well as all its people hypothetically—is the primary beneficiary. However, when it comes to the purpose of the modern educational systems, there are often multiple, contending goals of education even in the same model of education system. Labaree (1997) identifies three goals of education as democratic equality, social efficiency, and social mobility. The first two signify education as a public good: the former describes education as preparing responsible citizens that would help maintain a democratic society (a political role), while the latter describes education as preparing productive workers of a healthy economy (an economic role). As discussed above, the model of state-sponsored mass education described by Ramirez and Boli articulates education as a public good, or an institution primarily for national progress. The social mobility goal, on the other hand, depicts education as a private good, or a commodity, that provides individuals “competitive advantages in the struggle for desirable social positions” in a social hierarchy (p. 42). In line with this approach, some scholars argue that the modern system of education is actually an institution of class reproduction, benefiting certain groups with high status as opposed to the state or all citizens.
 
Classic conflict theory sees society as composed of different status groups, in struggle with one another for wealth, power, and prestige, and education as an apparatus of social reproduction employed by the dominant groups to maintain the status quo (Collins, 1971, p. 90). Based on the seminal concept of cultural capital, or familiarity with high status culture, Bourdieu (1977) raises an argument that the modern education system institutionally reproduces class hierarchies by keeping the access to dominant culture to the dominant groups. It is important to note that, despite the universal nature, schools in modern mass education are “not socially neutral institutions but reflect the experiences of the ‘dominant class’” (Lamont and Lareau, 1988, p. 45). For instance, middle-and-upper-class children would enter education with pre-established understandings of behaving, using languages, or dressing in ways dominant culture defines as “desirable” or “appropriate.” Whereas, working-class children strive to acquire the same social, cultural, and linguistic competencies as they enter schools, without institutional accommodation, often getting academically penalized in the process (p. 46). In this sense, education perpetuates the dominant group’s monopoly of cultural capital and wealth accumulated over generations, and the wealthy and powerful are the ones who benefit from the education.
