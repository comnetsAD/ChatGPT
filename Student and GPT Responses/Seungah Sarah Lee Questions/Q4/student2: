In this essay, I argue that while the modern educational system is created and expanded to create the public good of nation construction and individual citizenship by 1) achieving comprehensive national mobilization and constructing a unified/legitimate national polity, 2) cultivating collective national memory and narrative, 3) social efficiency and democratic equality, the individuals also gain private good of 1) realizing human rights, 2) accumulating human capitals to compete for social positions/opportunities. The system is expanded broadly and becomes central to social and cultural life thanks to the emergence of world ideas about progress and justice, and the rise of networks of development professionals and international development organizations. While the system benefits traditionally marginalized groups, it also protects the vested interests of the ruling class and groups with accumulated social and cultural capital.
The establishment of the modern educational system can be traced back to 19th-century Europe, under the context of competition among European nation-states. At that time, the European model of a national society also emerged “as the product of three transformations in European culture, polity, and economy” (Ramirez, and Boli 1987): 1) the Reformation and Counter-Reformation, which legitimized “the primacy of individuals, the significance of childhood and childhood socialization, and the expanded authority of the state”; 2) the construction of the national state and the interstate system, 3) and the triumph of the exchange economy, which “invested individuals with both the authority to conduct their own productive activities and the responsibility to support the state financially” (Ramirez, and Boli 1987). It is noteworthy that all these three transformations emphasize “the primacy of the socializable individual” (Berger, and Kellner 1973). For European states, in order to “consolidate state power both within the nation and relative to other national states”, they need to create a more unified national citizenry and let the individuals “find their primary identification with the states” (Ramirez, and Boli 1987). Thus, the state educational system is implemented to keep emphasizing the primacy of the individual by bringing them occupational success and social mobility while letting them believe in the myth of “national revitalization required individual revitalization,” thereby transforming them into national citizens. In this way, the state educational system becomes a means of national mobilization, thereby helping the state construct itself as a unified and legitimate national polity and can thus concentrate on nation construction after having “universal participation of citizens in national projects” (Ramirez, and Boli 1987), which increases social efficiency. This in turn helps the state win the competition. An example can be found in Chabbott and Ramirez’s article, in which they indicate that “the Franco-Prussian War had been won by the Prussian schoolmaster” (Chabbott, and Ramirez 2000).
As Ramirez and Boli mentioned in their article, their study of the European state educational system has contemporary relevance, which is that “the political construction of mass schooling is a worldwide institutional undertaking legitimated by what has become the world model of a national society” (Ramirez, and Boli 1987). Similar to the European state educational system, in today's globalized world, the education system also has content that emphasizes national identity. As mentioned in Ramirez and Lee’s article, “the historic nationalizing purpose of schooling does not go away” and “textbooks continue to celebrate a distinctive national state or society” (Ramirez, and Lee 2022). These claims and the example of North Korea’s textbooks refer to “capitalist American” bastards (Lankov, 2013, p. 60) the authors make all demonstrate that education as a contested, political space that cultivates collective memory and narrative, would still serve a legitimating function for the nation-state in today. Also, the content of the textbook shows the intention of today's education system to prepare students to become responsible citizens: as mentioned in Ramirez and Lee’s article, textbooks not only portray “active students involved and participating in society by volunteering to help the poor or joining a political party” (Bromley, 16 Meyer, and Ramirez, 2011) but also portray “traditionally marginalized groups such as women, children, and minorities, as having agency to make their own decisions and play a contributing role in society” (Lerch, Bromley, Ramirez & Meyer, 2017). In this way, it can be seen here that the education system wants to encourage students to “take action as participants and contributors to society, local or global” (Ramirez, and Lee 2022), which promotes democratic equality.
How individuals can benefit from the education system is more valued today than they were in 19th-century Europe. As Chabbot and Ramirez suggest in their article, there are two rationales that “a major role in buttressing confidence in the relationship between education and national development”, the first one “constructs education as an investment in human capital, which will increase the productivity of labor and contribute to economic growth and development at the societal level”, and the second one “constructs education as a human right, imagining education as the prime mechanism for human beings to better themselves and to participate fully in the economy, politics, and culture of their societies” (Chabbott, and Ramirez 2000). In fact, two big reasons for individuals to receive education in modern society to ensure the acquisition of human capital and the realization of human rights are because of the rise of “a world culture emphasizing progress and justice” (Fagerlind & Saha, 1983; Meyer, Poll, Thomas, & Ramirez, 1997; Robertson, 1992), which led to the calls from networks of development professionals and international development organizations. As mentioned by Chabbott and Ramirez, these international development professionals “have invoked taken-for-granted ideals to mobilize both nation-states and NGOs around a menu of technical-functional education needs”, and “played an important role in recent decades in diffusing blueprints of education and in the development and the expansion of different levels and types of education in different decades” (Chabbott, and Ramirez 2000). Because of their efforts on appeals, monetary support, and research, global education norms and models that are discussed at international conferences can be implemented at the local/national level, and thus enable more socially marginalized people to get access to education, which in this way let them realize their human rights and contribute to society while accumulating human capital to support themselves (which is both a public and private good). 
The modern educational system and its diffusion thus benefit those traditionally marginalized groups that can’t access education before, as they can earn a living through the knowledge and skills they acquire through learning while creating value for society. However, when these people are required to take the same exams as those with strong social and cultural capital, they often fail. As mentioned in Ramirez and Lee’s article, early sorting of using high stakes tests “is also seen as unfair to the many who did not enjoy the home background (social and cultural capital) with which to better hone and display their actual or potential talent” (Ramirez, and Lee 2022). Though these tests “are declining and even milder test-based barriers to entry into higher education are challenged by the rise of test-optional policies” (Furtuna, 2017), this trend only happens recently and is not widespread. In fact, educational systems in many countries still use unified examinations as the only selection mechanism, including China. As Bordieu indicates, those families with strong cultural capital “are more inclined to invest in their children’s education” and  “have at their disposal the means of ensuring for this capital the best academic placing for its investment”. In this way, “their academic investments cannot fail to be extremely profitable” (Bourdieu, 1977). In terms of taking exams, take the Chinese context as an example, those families who have capital and social networks will sign up for test-oriented extracurricular classes for their kids. In most cases, this will help their kids to get better grades than those who don’t take those classes. The privilege of those families which have already held strong capital will thus be “concealed beneath the cloak of a perfectly democratic method of selection” (Bourdieu, 1977) and let those students from families lacking cultural capital always lose in the competition of getting higher and better education and accumulating human capital and social capital. As long as the selection method remains unchanged, this can become a vicious circle.
