Modern education which we know today as schooling of basic subjects like language, science,
and mathematics, was not always a given. Formal schooling used to be reserved for the select
few. The implementation of public education was a revolutionary idea. This worldwide expansion
of schooling was initiated in 1948 with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Article 26L
which stated that “everyone has the right to education”.
 
Education has expanded to become so large due to a country's interest in educating its citizens.
The rise in political construction of mass schooling is implemented to increase economic growth,
train citizens to be educated and skilled workers, and construct unified national polity. Education
serves as an investment in human capital and sets up institutions that influence and perpetuate
individuals with different levels of social and cultural capital.
Human capital translates into the collection of one’s skill level (Gary S. Becker). Essentially, the
higher the education, the higher the skill level, the higher the economic growth of a person. This
could give access to upward social mobility. However, typically due to the unequal access of
quality education, schools provide human capital to those who can afford it. Human capital
focuses on the pure skill of an individual, again, ignoring how it was attained and who has
access to it. Not only does this play a role, but personal differences influence how much human
capital an individual may have.
 
Social capital is the total connections among individuals. As a result of community and social
relations, social networks enform (Coleman, James S. 1988). A network of a person usually
comes from having similar experiences or similar backgrounds. This creates norms of
reciprocity and trustworthiness when meeting/developing a relationship. Educational institutions
often act as a network creation of people as well as providing and reproducing social capital.
Cultural capital is the knowledge of “high” culture, educational attainment, curriculum of elite
schools, mastery of “practices”, capacity to perform tasks in “culturally acceptable” ways
(Michele Lamont and Annette Lareau). It is the knowledge one has of the “dominant culture”.
Bourdieu (1977) argues that it is an informal academic standard, a class attribute, a basis of
social selection, and a resource for power which is salient as an indicator/basis of class position.
Cultural capital can also be used as a basis for exclusion through self elimination, overselection,
relegation, and direct exclusion.
 
An individual's human capital, social capital, and cultural capital influence their outcomes and
opportunities in the world during and after their education. This can either greatly advantage or
disadvantage them. Individuals of high socioeconomic status are advantaged for these reasons
and many that come along with this system.
 
Human, social, and cultural capital also all come into play when taking a closer look at the
“hidden curriculum”. The hidden curriculum influences an individual's experience in their
primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of education. The knowledge learned from this unofficial
curriculum includes the standard expectation of how to act and what to know in behavioral
contexts and academic contexts. It includes the “unofficial” social rules like dress code and
behavior. If a person is familiar and actively partakes in it through the influence of human, social,
and cultural capital, this can propel a person into high society (Gary S. Becker) (Michele Lamont
and Annette Lareau). If a person is unaware or lacking in this knowledge, they can also be
actively discriminated against.
 
Wealthy citizens have the money to pay for elite institutions that offer quality education and pave
a path to good universities often leading to high income (again, not always the case but the
most common case). “Educational system fulfills a function of legitimation which is more and
more necessary to the perpetuation of the ‘social order’” (Bourdieu, 1977). They also have
social capital through the network of others part of this high socioeconomic status. These
relationships can further advance citizens to high-paying jobs due to intrinsic connections.
Low-income citizens don't have the money to pay for elite institutions, cutting them off from
high-quality education, a gateway to good universities and jobs, as well as creating connections
that can land them a high-paying job. There are ways to get there (scholarships, financial aid
programs, non-profit organizations…) but most education systems do not work in their favor
thereby further creating a divide in the national income gap (Labaree, David F. 1997).
All of these debates surrounding who gets greater benefits of education and why are influenced
by the basis of the question of what purpose education should serve in the first place. Different
philosophies and systems are supportive of one or more purposes. The first is that education
should prepare citizens (democratic equality) in order to help achieve public good. Second, that
education is to train workers in order to reach social efficiency. If a citizen can work due to
human capital, they can be a good taxpayer and therefore have a greater effect on public good.
Lastly, there is the social mobility approach where education is seen as a private good offered to
a consumer who can afford it. The difference between social mobility and social efficiency is that
social mobility is about one person moving up or down in the socioeconomic ladder. Social
efficiency is about allocating people. It is also one thing to argue which one is ideally the “best”
for all parties and which one is realistic (John W. Meyer).
 
Whether education is a public or private good can be identified only through the analysis of ease
of social stratification and social mobility. Different theories of education address the issue of
stratification differently.
 
The functional theory assumes a fixed demand for skills of various types at a given time since
positions must be filled with persons with necessary training and skills (Randall Collins).
Because occupational positions require particular kinds of skilled performance, schools are
viewed as training institutions (human capital priority aiming to achieve the social efficiency
goal). Functional theory does provide a testable explanation for which groups would be able to
dominate which positions. When skillset increases, new categories of schools and classes are
added thereby making society increasingly functional and economically productive.
The Conflict Theory of Stratification reinforces socio-economic hierarchy. There is a clear
struggle for advantage. This is maintained since employers use education to elect persons for
various positions and ranks thereby making education a proxy for social and cultural attributes.
This individualistic approach can be linked to the concept of social mobility and seeing
education as a private good. Here, social and cultural capital would play a larger role than just
human capital. It allows for privileged people to continue to rise to the top thereby producing
more social inequality.
 
Lastly, the Institutionalist Perspective views education as ideologies that define “modern
society”. It suggests that schools constitute a ritual system, a form of initiation ceremonies and
classification of information. This focus on larger macro trends legitimizes global aspects.
The ideals of what education should do for society and what it actually does shows there are
functional flaws in the system that greatly advantage some and disadvantage others. By
evaluating what outcome is truly desired and designing an effective system for it, equality for
citizens can be reached through initiatives valuing equity. Similar to the philosophy of Bourdieu
and John W. Meyer, I too believe that educational institutions act as stratifying catalysts
separating upper and lower classes. Research on the effects of how this is done and what
effects this has on people can start the conversation necessary to close this gap.
