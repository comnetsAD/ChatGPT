The "teacher effect" refers to the impact that teachers have on student learning and development. Research has shown that teacher quality is one of the most important factors in student achievement and that effective teachers can have a positive impact on student outcomes, such as test scores, graduation rates, and college enrollment.

However, while teachers are an essential component of delivering quality education, they are not the only factor. Other important considerations include the availability and quality of resources and infrastructure, such as classrooms, textbooks, and technology, as well as the overall educational system and policies in place.

Furthermore, providing "inclusive and equitable quality education" (SDG 4) also requires addressing structural inequalities, such as poverty, discrimination, and lack of access to education, that can limit educational opportunities and outcomes for marginalized groups.

For example, providing access to early childhood education, providing education in multiple languages, and providing special education services can help support inclusive education. Additionally, policies and programs that address poverty, such as school feeding programs and cash transfers, can also help ensure that all students have the resources and support they need to succeed in school.

Therefore, while increasing the supply of qualified teachers is an important aspect of improving the quality of education, it is not sufficient on its own. It must be complemented by other efforts to improve the overall education system and address structural inequalities, in order to achieve the goal of inclusive and equitable quality education for all.
