SDG Target 4.C highlights the importance of increasing the supply of qualified teachers for delivering quality education, particularly in developing countries. The teacher effect refers to the impact that teachers have on student learning and academic achievement. Studies have shown that teachers play a crucial role in student learning and that teacher quality is one of the most important factors affecting student outcomes.

However, while teachers are a critical component of delivering quality education, they are not the only factor. In order to deliver "inclusive and equitable quality education" (SDG 4), a range of other factors must also be considered. These include:
Adequate and well-equipped facilities
Access to education for all, including marginalized and disadvantaged groups
Curriculum that is inclusive and culturally responsive
Supportive and inclusive school culture
Adequate funding for education
Quality leadership and governance

Therefore, while qualified teachers are essential for delivering quality education, it is also important to address other systemic and structural factors that can hinder or support the delivery of inclusive and equitable quality education. This may include addressing issues such as poverty, discrimination, and lack of infrastructure and resources.
