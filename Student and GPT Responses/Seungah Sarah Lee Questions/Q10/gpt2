SDG Target 4.C recognizes the importance of increasing the supply of qualified teachers as a key factor in achieving inclusive and equitable quality education. The "teacher effect" refers to the impact that teachers have on student learning and educational outcomes. Research has shown that having an effective teacher can have a significant impact on student academic achievement and long-term success.

However, while teachers are an essential component of delivering quality education, they alone may not be enough to achieve inclusive and equitable quality education. Other factors such as access to resources, school infrastructure, and community engagement also play a crucial role in ensuring that all students have access to an inclusive and equitable education.

Additionally, it's important to note that having a qualified teacher does not guarantee that the education provided is inclusive and equitable. A teacher may be qualified, but without proper training and support, they may perpetuate biases and discrimination, which will negatively impact the education of marginalized students. Therefore, it's important to focus on teacher training and development that addresses equity, diversity and inclusion, and ensure that teachers are equipped with the knowledge, skills and practices to deliver inclusive and equitable education.

In conclusion, while increasing the supply of qualified teachers is important for delivering quality education, it is not enough to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education. Additional efforts must be made to address structural inequalities and ensure that all students have access to the resources and support they need to succeed.
