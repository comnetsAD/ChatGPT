The public education system
Education in bahrain consists of four stages (Only 2 are compulsory)
¡  Preschool: kg1-kg2
¡  Elementary (primary) school: grade 1-6
¡  Middle school: grade 7-9
¡  Secondary school: grade 10-12 (vocational or unified track)
Unified track: scientific, literary, and commercial. (BAHRAIN'S EDUCATION SYSTEM, NA)
¡  Students also take a national exam every 3 years staring from grade 3 until grade 12 which includes the core subjects like: Arabic, math, English and science. (National Examinations​, 2022)
The issue
The quality of education during covid was poor because of:
¡  Lack to training and foundation from the teacher’s side.
¡  The student’s lack of motivation to study while at home.
This has led students to depend on google and other online means (even family members) to solve exams and assignments.
 
The average of students increased if u compare 2018 and 2022 and this is proof that students are probably using online means to find answers rather than solving and studying themselves which has boosted their averages. Especially since the quality of education online is not as good as in real life.
Solutions and policies
The ministry of education did not take any harsh measures to solve this problem. They did the following:
¡  A face-to-face option was provided with all the safety measures that are required to aviod covid cases.
¡  Teachers were supposed to work in school even if classes were online which improved the quality of teaching.
¡  Attandence was compulsory in some cases and affected the grades of students.
 
The university of Bahrain (UoB), a public university, took its own measures by making students conduct entrance exams and face to face interviews as part of the admission process (eAdmission Service , 2021). Moreover, most of the admission offers were a diploma with a chance of continuing to obtain a bachelor’s degree if your GPA satisfies the requirement. This method made it fair for students so that if you pass the diploma you can proceed to get a bachelor’s degree.
