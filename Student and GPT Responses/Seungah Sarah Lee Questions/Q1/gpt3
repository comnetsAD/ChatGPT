Country Context:
The United States is a federal republic with 50 states and a capital district
It is one of the most developed and industrialized countries in the world
It has a diverse population with a mix of different ethnic and racial groups

Language of Instruction:
English is the primary language of instruction in schools
Many schools also offer programs for English Language Learners (ELLs) to help students who speak other languages at home

Features of K-12 Education System:
The K-12 education system in the United States is primarily controlled by state and local governments
It is composed of primary and secondary education, which is divided into three levels: elementary, middle, and high school
Public schools are free and compulsory for students between the ages of 6 and 16
Curriculum and instruction vary by state, but generally include subjects such as math, science, English, social studies, and foreign languages
There are also private schools, which are not government-funded and can have different curricula and admission requirements

Education Issue of Concern:
One major issue of concern in the United States is the achievement gap between different racial and ethnic groups. Studies have shown that students of color and low-income students tend to have lower academic achievement and graduation rates compared to their white and more affluent peers.

Key Education Policies and Programs Addressing the Issue:
Title I of the No Child Left Behind Act provides federal funding to schools with high concentrations of low-income students to help improve their academic performance.
The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) replaced the No Child Left Behind Act in 2015 and gives more control to states and local school districts in addressing the achievement gap.
The Obama Administration's "My Brother's Keeper" initiative focuses on improving outcomes for boys and young men of color.
Some states have implemented policies to address the achievement gap, such as the "Weighted Student Formula" in California, which provides more funding to schools with higher concentrations of low-income students and students of color.

Overall, the United States has a well-established education system, but there is a significant achievement gap between different racial and ethnic groups, which has prompted various government policies and programs to address this issue.
