Country Background Context (brief description of your country and give us a bit of
context to understand the country)
- Mexico is located under North America. The country which predominantly makes up
most of Central America is run by the capital located in Mexico City (DF / CDMX).
- There are extremely high levels of poverty that continue to increase as well as a top 1%
