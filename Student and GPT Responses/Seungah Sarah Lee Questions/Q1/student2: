Country Background Context
The People’s Republic of China was founded only 73 years ago. In its first 30 years of groping for social construction (we often call that era as High Socialism era), China experienced many ups and downs, including the Cultural Revolution started in 1966 which lasts for a decade. During the Cultural Revolution, the school system was completely shut down. After the Reform and Opening Up that starts in 1979, China gradually joined the world economic system. After more than 40 years of development, China's economy has grown tremendously, and it has developed from a poor country to the second largest economy in the world. In addition, China has completely eliminated absolute poverty by 2021. This is something I am proud of as a Chinese.
Looking at China’s progress, I’ll definitely give credit to the hard-working social mentality. However, in my opinion, this hard-working mentality is gradually going to extremes in China nowadays, leading people to engage in more intense rat races for social resources and positions, and I’ll be talking about its demonstration in the education field later when we discuss the education issue and trend.
 
Compulsory Education
According to Chapter I, Article 2 of the “Compulsory Education Law of the People's Republic of China” enacted on September 1st, 2006, the People’s Republic of China implemented a nine-year compulsory education system, which includes six years in primary school and three years in middle school. During the implementation of compulsory education, students will not be charged tuition and miscellaneous fees.
Also according to Chapter II, Article 11 of this law, all children who have reached the age of six should be sent to school to receive and complete compulsory education. For children in areas where conditions are not available, their age of starting compulsory education can be delayed to seven years old.
Language of Instruction
 According to Chapter II, Article 10 of the “The People's Republic of China State General Language and Character Law” enacted on January 1st, 2001, Schools and other educational institutions should use Mandarin and standardized Chinese characters as the basic educational and teaching language characters.
 However, according to Chapter I, Article 8 of this law, each ethnicity has the freedom to use and develop its own language and script. This happened to be true in some Ethnic Minority Autonomous Regions in China, such as Xinjiang, and Tibet, where local minority students are taught bilingually. However, in other Ethnic Minority Autonomous Regions, they only use Mandarin to teach. For example, In the summer of 2021, I traveled to the Yao Autonomous Region in southern Hunan Province to do volunteer work in an educational NGO program, where local high school students told us they never use the Yao language for learning.
This is a debatable topic: while some people criticize that not teaching minority languages and scripts will lead to the loss of minority cultures, some people support this policy because they believe it will help minority people integrate into mainstream society.
Key features of the K-12 public education system​
  First of all, the exit exam for this system is the College Entrance Examination. In this exam, students will need to choose three subjects out of six subjects, which are: History, Geography, Politics, Physics, Chemistry, and Biology.
 Students’ track or the range of the majors students can choose from university, depends on the three subjects students take in College Entrance Examination. Namely, if students choose a combo of Physics, Chemistry, and Biology, they can choose most of the majors in universities, including those in Humanity and Social Science category. In comparison, if students choose the combo of History, Geography, and Politics, they can only choose 60% of the majors, and won’t be able to choose most of the STEM majors. Empirically, I choose History, Geography, and Politics to take the examination. If I go to a domestic university in China, the range of majors I can choose will be relatively limited. So I’m very lucky to enroll in NYU Shanghai, where I can freely choose any major if I want.
 For the preference of majors, according to NYU Shanghai’s graduate destinations report in 2021, nearly 80% of students would choose a STEM or Business major. The situation is similar in domestic universities in China, where students tend to choose a STEM or Business major over Social Science or Humanity major. The biggest reason is arguably related to income.
 Finally, I have to say this system is test-oriented, as most of the things students do at school to practice their skills for taking exams, particularly in the areas that don’t have enough educational resources. The competition is also very fierce, as the vast majority of students need to take the College Entrance Examination to obtain a very limited number of undergraduate opportunities. According to a news report from China News, 11.93 million students took the College Entrance Examination in 2022, with an undergraduate acceptance rate of just 41.6 percent.
Education issue/trend: rat race of taking extracurricular classes
One long-lasting education issue/trend in China is the rat race of taking extracurricular classes. In one research paper published in 2021, two researchers made the conclusion that “due to the undifferentiated educational opportunities of high schools and the scarcity of high-quality high school educational resources, families with higher social strata will try to get their children to participate in extracurricular tutoring, trying to help them build an advantage in the high school entrance examination competition to enter the demonstration high school and receive better high school educational resources” (Xue&Fang, 2021). In fact, the situation is the same when Chinese students try to enroll in better middle schools, high schools, and universities.
 When parents work hard to find extracurricular class resources, and students work hard in their spare time to take extracurricular classes, the competition has become a fierce rat race. When everyone is following this trend, the rat race is becoming fiercer. It’s also noteworthy that this mainly happens in urban areas in China, where people tend to have better incomes and can afford to take multiple extracurricular classes. In consequence, the competitiveness of students from areas with relatively poorer educational resources, such as rural areas, is diminished.
Policy to address the issue: the "Double Reduction" policy​
 Realizing that this trend is “not conducive to social mobility and educational equity” (Xue&Fang, 2021) and create an anxious social mentality, the Ministry of Education of the People's Republic of China enacted a policy called “Opinions on further reducing the burden of homework and off-campus training for students in compulsory education”, later known as the “Double Reduction Policy”.
 One command this policy gives is to shut down all offline extracurricular institutions that offer test-oriented K-12 courses. While it did alleviate educational anxiety and promote educational equity to some extent, the higher-class people from the urban area can still have access to those resources online, if they are willing to pay more. This has formed a black market.
