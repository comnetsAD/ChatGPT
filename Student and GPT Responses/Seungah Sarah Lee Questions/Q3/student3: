Due to the consequences they have on the nations and countries in which they would be implemented, educational reform is unquestionably one of the most sophisticated and divisive concerns in the field of education. I believe we should look at how the educational process has been collaborating with economic, political, and sociocultural factors in order to understand and analyze educational reform as either imperative that we need to improve the life chances of children and ensure the future of society or educational reform as improbable.
 
The ultimate goal of schooling is the social, political, and economic results desired by society. The ability to sustain both production and consumption depends on a sufficient number of people who have received the necessary training and upbringing. To contribute to a political system that works well, adults must be politically acculturated. To preserve a stable social order from one generation to the next, social and cultural traditions must be recognized. In this regard, education plays a significant part in preparing people to take on their adult obligations in their entirety.
 
Typically, more uplifting statements are made about educational outcomes. As a result, it is widely believed that schools boost social mobility within the state and aid in the growth of the economy and politics. But in another aspect, this dynamic has led to social stratification that has affected the majority of the people. Conflict theory as a whole suggests that the organization's elite chooses its new members and important assistants from within its own status group and makes an attempt to hire lower-level staff  members who are at least instructed to appreciate the superiority of their status culture. Comparable to how the Functional theorists put it, the number of occupations requiring low skill is decreasing while the proportion requiring high skill is increasing, which causes inequality and raises the educational needs of jobs in industrial society.
 
Understanding the social hierarchy that the educational process has contributed to throughout the years, we understand that educational reform is necessary to enhance the lives of the future generation and ensure that inequality is eliminated.. However, it is very crucial to keep in mind Khanâ€™s statement that no society will ever be equal. Questions about inequality are not "ls there inequality?" but instead "How much inequality is there, and what is its character?" Inequality is more tolerable if its character is perceived as "fair." Even Since education is a mechanism of development for social progress, and educational reform is all about enhancing educational quality and ensuring educational equity for all people worldwide, this reform concept has always been in the government discourse of most countries and involves international institutions. When discussing educational reform, one refers to adjustments and changes made to the educational system that involve such elements as educational philosophy, student policies, curriculum, pedagogical knowledge, classroom work, institution, strategic planning, and financial management, as well as their relationships to inclusive growth. In this regard, who gains from the process will be greatly influenced by how and by whom reform is framed and implemented. For example, Modernization theorists drew on Parson's (1957) theories of structural differentiation to explain how institutions multiply and the simple structures of traditional society become more complex in response to changes in technology and/or values.
 
For most of these theorists, modernization was roughly equivalent to Westernization. In addition Bourdieu also mentioned that cultural capital consists of informal academic standards which are also class attributes of the dominant class. These standards and attributes are: informal knowledge about the school, traditional humanist culture, linguistic competence and specific attitudes, or personal style (e.g., ease, naturalness, aloofness, creativity, distinction and "brilliance").
 
We demonstrate how educational reform is required to build a single system that eliminates inequality between affluent and poor pupils using the Modernization theory and Bourdieu notion as a framework. Nonetheless, it is more complicated than we thought, and reformation could bring about much more global chaos. According to the lecture in week 5, the globe is concentrating on constructing mass schools and delivering education globally rather than educational reform, and this result has a favorable effect on economic development. But it's also important to consider how much greater education might advance social equality. Collins emphasized that to the extent that this is true, increased worldwide emphasis on formal schooling may increase the tendency to use formal degrees as certification for those seeking jobs, thereby increasing individual returns to schooling without necessarily increasing individual productivity.
 
Economic interests have a growing influence in education generally, which might have the reverse effect of promoting greater equality. Significant ideological changes are taking place not only in the goal of education but also in the elements of curriculum and instruction that are within control. This has been supplemented by initiatives to make education an economic good on par with other goods, as well as to strengthen the influence of economic needs on schools.
 
Overall, I would say that even though schooling is extremely complex and intensely personal, it is conceptually possible to achieve educational reform and better the lives of future generations. In other words, it frequently matters more how reforms are implemented than whether they are implemented at all. Reforms with insufficient numbers of ardent supporters frequently fail, while those with a slender foundation of support may encounter political obstacles. Federal legislation and philanthropy can be helpful, but they can also act as a hindrance. They run the risk of weakening the formation of the alliances required to make reforms lasting.
