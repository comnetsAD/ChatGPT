Teachers, parents, human and cultural capital are factors that contribute and affect a child’s education. While teachers and parents can have an indirect effect on a child’s motivation, knowledge intake and career, human and cultural capital influences the quality of that education and future job opportunities. All these factors have been studied as improvements in the educational sector. However, they all also proved to be more problematic in terms of equity issues when it comes to reforming the educational system. I argue that a child that has enough support in his home – as in supportive parents – and highly qualified professional teachers can help himself improve in aspects of human and cultural capital. Hence, showing that motivation and support can be the factor that pushes children – who are influenced easily – to strive and achieve his best educational potential. Notwithstanding, having the resources only will not help in terms of improvement. In this argument, the following texts will be used to support my analysis of the argument: “Human Capital” by Gary S. Becker, “Cultural Capital: Allusions, Gaps, and “Glissandos in Recent Theoretical Developments” by Michèle Lamont and Annette Lareau, “Father Involvement and Education in the Middle East: Geography, Gender, and Generations” by Natasha Ridge and Soohyun Jeon and “Teacher Quality: Boarding and Deepening the Debate” by Greg Duncan James Spillane.
In the context of human capital – investments that influence future monetary and psychic income (Becker, 1975) – like, “schooling, on-the-job training and medical care” (Becker, 1975) can all affect a child’s future career path. On the other hand, cultural capital “consists of informal academic standards” (Lamont, 1988) which can include taste, preferences, and informal knowledge about school or “common knowledge.” Although it is argued that “it cannot constitute as an indicator of class position or power resource” (Lamont, 1988), I believe it can still affect the chances of a student getting into world top education systems and obtaining well-paying jobs. These high positions and good quality education are influenced by the way someone dresses, chooses their words, preferences, and the capacity of “general knowledge” that they know. Nonetheless, for a child to gain this knowledge and sense of formality in talking and dressing, they should be supported by their family and have teachers who care about their well-being and knowledge.
An example can be the GCC countries in this situation. As the results of Ridge and Jeon proved, the involvement of fathers in the GCC countries is lower than expected which can affect the child’s improvement in aspects like research and motivation to attend world top universities and get enrolled into international curriculums to improve their human and cultural capital. To prove this point, we notice that most male teenagers get into the military instead of aiming for higher education and that is because males in the Gulf families are not as encouraged to aim for higher education as females are (Ridge 2020). Additionally, teachers also play a huge part in this process. This is because a teacher with good teaching skills, that has enough human and cultural capital, has the ability to help students through their journey as well as the ability to influence them into becoming global students with critical thinking skills that can dress, speak, and talk professionally which enhances their chances of getting high positions in the future. Moreover, if the teacher’s credentials are high, it will help the students understand the importance of gaining human capital that has a direct effect on their future income. In terms of cultural capital, a supportive teacher can influence and help their students aim for international curriculums and further pursue higher education.
Although these conditions change from one household to another and from one school to another. For example, not all teachers have good credentials and not all households are supportive of their children’s education. In the Gulf, having an influence is an important factor in shaping the child’s flow of thoughts, which will eventually motivate them into improving as a developed individual with the “correct” manners and fundamentals to attend international schools and universities, which leads to well-paying jobs and positions in the future.
A conclusion to this argument is that support from parents and highly accredited teachers is an important factor in determining whether the child is able to enhance his human and cultural capital. Even though investments in human and cultural capital is already known as a method of improvement, the return on investment will only appear if the child is thoroughly supported by an environment that motivates him to grow as a global individual. Especially in the gulf, the lack of parent’s support proved that children need the correct motivation to continue growing and improving in order to enter global job markets and have the appropriate skills for a high position in society. It is important to note that this essay did not include how cultural capital revolves around a “dominant culture”, which can be another cause for why people in the Gulf are not adopting these “informal academic standards” (Lamont, 1988).
