These two perceptions of reality interact with each other in the sense that they reflect the ongoing debate about the effectiveness of educational reform. On one hand, there is a recognition that educational reform is necessary in order to improve the life chances of children and ensure the future of society. This perspective emphasizes the need for change and improvement in the education system in order to address issues such as the achievement gap, inadequate resources, and outdated teaching methods.

On the other hand, there is a perception that educational reform is improbable due to the complexities and challenges involved in implementing change. This perspective highlights the difficulties in navigating the political, bureaucratic, and economic structures that shape education systems, as well as the potential for unintended consequences of reform efforts.

These perceptions shape education, education systems, and processes in a number of ways. For example, the perception that educational reform is necessary can lead to a focus on accountability and assessment, as well as the development of policies and programs aimed at addressing specific issues such as the achievement gap. On the other hand, the perception that educational reform is improbable can lead to a more cautious approach to change, with a focus on incremental improvements and pilot programs rather than large-scale reform efforts.

Overall, these two perceptions of reality interact with each other in shaping education, education systems, and processes by highlighting the need for change and improvement while also acknowledging the challenges and complexities involved in implementing reform. This ongoing debate can inform the development of education policies and programs that are both ambitious and practical.
