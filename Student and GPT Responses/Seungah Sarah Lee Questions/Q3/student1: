Educational reform usually refers to the governmental effort to change the current public education system to realize educational goals and ideals. To analyze educational reform, an understanding of educational goals ("the ideals") and sociological theories ("the realities" as in ideal types) is essential. In this essay, I will first interpret and justify educational reforms and identify the possible problems that hinder the effectiveness of such reforms using the social theories and empirical studies drawn from class readings. As the importance of education is considered a consensus by most national governments and international organizations, the educational system is dynamically adjusted for changing ideologies. I argue that the outcomes of educational reform may uncouple from the goals as the prowess of public mass education may be overestimated, and the goals may not align with real needs.
 
The statement in question points out that educational reform aims to secure individuals' "life chances" and "the future of society." This claim is consistent with the three alternative educational goals proposed by Labaree (1997): social mobility, which corresponds to students' life chances, and democratic equality and social efficiency, which correspond to long-term societal benefits. In Development and Education, Chabbott & Ramirez (2006) also argue that the two main rationales for developing countries to strongly believe in the significance of education on development are seeing it as an effective investment in human capital and as a human right that enables access to equal life opportunities. Despite the validity of such beliefs, educational reform has been prioritized by policymakers globally, and the hopes are for maximizing social productivity and tackling inequalities.
 
However, the fact that people always call for educational reforms suggests that the goals are never met. One critical reason is that the power of public mass education may be misjudged. There are several problems that are almost impossible to be fully addressed through changes in public education alone. As Bourdieu (1985) proposed, cultural and social reproduction takes place across generations, while the school is only one of the many environments where this process occurs. The passing-on of cultural and social capital is extremely unlikely to be interrupted by educational reform. Despite government intervention, privileged students can still benefit from private tutoring (even from the black market), greater life chances with their social capital (e.g., family networking), and the more subtle concept of "habitus" (Bourdieu, 1977), as portrayed by Baker (2014) in The Schooled Society.
 
Furthermore, education's role in creating human capital and boosting productivity may be exaggerated. Oftentimes, schools act as selective institutions that equip students with credentials rather than skills, while employers lack specific criteria for candidates and value credentials over competencies as well (Parsons, 1964). Employers tend to appreciate Ivy League education over vocational education, as the former not only proves the individual's intellectual ability but also implicitly signifies their social status. As such, hiring selection based on credentials can be easier and more efficient for employers. This status quo exacerbates inequalities as underprivileged students have significantly lower chances of attending prestigious colleges. Its economic effect is also ambiguous. According to Ramirez (1997), while empirical studies confirm the positive correlation between educational attainment and wages, education's effects on social productivity remain unclear. As Parsons (1964) argued, education is exceptionally important, but this is more of a consequence of the workings of society rather than its own importance. Education reform, like any other type of policy, is unlikely to be sufficient to perfectly solve issues deeply embedded in modern society, like inequality.
 
Beyond only scratching the surface of social issues, educational reform may even undermine social progress and reinforce some problems. International development organizations rarely design educational policies based on current academic research; their policies are more likely to align with national development ideologies (Ramirez, 1997). One of the dangers of such practice is the time-lag issue, which is especially important regarding educational policies. Education does not have an immediate impact on either people or society: primary and secondary education usually takes 12 years to complete, and an important proportion of the population starts working after receiving higher education. This indicates that, while economies can fluctuate greatly within months and go through economic cycles every couple of years, educational policies always need significantly more time to effectuate. Without careful consideration for long-term educational policies, impatient changes made to the educational system may nurture future threats.
 
Education is often deemed the mythical, omnipotent solution to the most challenging social issues. This perception prompts continual efforts and a desire to reform the educational system. While such efforts are much needed, they need to be better directed. The uncoupling of reform goals and outcomes suggests the need for better planning and rethinking of educational systems, reforms, and goals.
