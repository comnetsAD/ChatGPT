These two perceptions of reality highlight the complex and nuanced nature of educational reform. On one hand, there is a recognition that educational reform is necessary in order to improve the life chances of children and ensure the future of society. This perspective emphasizes the importance of addressing issues such as the achievement gap, inadequate funding for schools, and lack of access to quality education for certain populations.

On the other hand, the perception that educational reform is improbable highlights the many challenges and obstacles that can arise when attempting to implement change in education systems. This perspective acknowledges that the education system is complex and multifaceted, and that efforts to reform it can often be hindered by bureaucratic obstacles, resistance from stakeholders, and a lack of political will.

These two perceptions of reality interact with each other in a number of ways. For example, the recognition of the need for reform can motivate individuals and groups to advocate for change and push for policies that address issues such as the achievement gap. However, the recognition of the obstacles and challenges that reform efforts can encounter can also lead to cynicism and a sense of resignation that meaningful change is not possible.

The way in which these two perceptions shape education, education systems and/or processes varies depending on the context. In some cases, the recognition of the need for reform can lead to significant progress, such as the implementation of policies that increase funding for schools and provide support for disadvantaged students. However, in other cases, the obstacles and challenges to reform can lead to stagnation and a lack of progress in addressing important issues. Overall, it is important to be aware of both the need for reform and the obstacles that can arise in efforts to implement change in the education system in order to create sustainable and effective solutions.
