Education has been a big factor in enhancing human and cultural capital in many ways such as having the skills to perform specific tasks and having the social assets that will help develop the skills of a higher class and more formal ways to build connections with individuals and promote social mobility. Education has not been offered for everyone, which is what created this inequality between the people in the higher class and the working class because the “culture” sees that having socials skills as well as a good education from a high-ranking institution is what makes an individual capable of working a high paying job or a role that needs leadership skills. Moreover, this education was only offered to the white people or the “elite” race which was unfair to the other races and made them inferior to them. In consequence, this has made the elites acquire higher education in world top institutions and getting the high roles in the hierarchy while the working-class families and other races can only afford to send their kids in a community college/institution (Becker, 1975).
      	Education and being able to receive an education can help remove the social inequality and help people gain human capital and cultural capital. In terms of human capital, individuals will gain knowledge and have the skills to be able to complete job specific tasks. On the other hand, cultural capital revolves around having the ability and social skills to promote social mobility such as education as well as skills to dress and speak appropriately. This inequality has been shrinking for the past years and this can be seen from the journal Privilege by Shamus Khan, who went to St. Paul’s high school thanks to his parents’ wealth. During his time there, he saw that most of the students were white, entitled, wealthy kids from the top 5% of the wealthiest American families. He graduated and returned as a faculty member and saw that a lot of racial diversity was present, which proves that the problem of inequality of being of a favored “culture” of race was not as big as it used to so, why do employees still look at which school the employer graduated from?
      	A lot of institutions nowadays try to diversify their student body but the problem that is being disregarded is that people from different races and backgrounds cannot afford these big institutions or a good quality of education which creates an inequality gap between the top wealthy people and the people from lower classes. Because of this, the top wealthy families in the country still hold the high positions and most of the assets while the working class still struggles to get out of the poverty cycle (Becker, 1975). An example can be that students that graduate from Ivy leagues are most probably getting high paying jobs while the students who graduate from a university outside of the US will likely be inferior to those with Ivy league degrees.
      	Education can reduce social inequality in society; however it cannot help the induvial from the working class achieve social mobility because the education that they received is not as culturally recognized as other global curriculums or institutions. This creates a big inequality between the people who can get into these institutions – sometimes even by donations and other financial means – and the people who have the ability to be in a world top university or secondary education but cannot afford it.
