After several discussions in class, it has become increasingly clear that educational institutions in the United States pave a path to high-paying jobs for members born into wealthy families in comparison to citizens born into low socioeconomic positions (Shamus Khan). While there are significant numbers of exceptions to this claim, the educational system continues to advantage wealthy citizens in a variety of ways. This essay seeks to explore the sociological and psychological explanation for this, as well as exploit the flaws of the system that help perpetuate these inequalities.
 
Human, social, and cultural capital all come into play when taking a closer look at the “hidden curriculum”. The hidden curriculum influences an individual's experience in their primary, secondary, and tertiary levels of education. The knowledge learned from this unofficial curriculum includes the standard expectation of how to act and what to know in behavioral contexts and academic contexts. It includes the “unofficial” social rules like dress code and behavior. If a person is familiar and actively partakes in it through the influence of human, social, and cultural capital, this can propel a person into high society (Gary S. Becker) (Michele Lamont and Annette Lareau). If a person is unaware or lacking in this knowledge, they can actively be discriminated against.
 
The attainment of knowledge in the hidden curriculum, specifically in the behavioral, social, and academic fields, is carried out through a variety of concepts studied and identified by behavioral psychology. Understanding these is vital so the distinction between a “high society” citizen with access to multiple opportunities compared to a disadvantaged citizen can be further understood. The concept that stands out the most is Social Identity Theory, Social cognitive theory, and the process of Enculturation. When an individual understands what social group they belong to they adapt their behavior to be similar to others in that group. They identify role models and recreate their behavior. A person born into a high socioeconomic status is going to believe they belong to this group and emulate/learn the behavior expected of them. A member of low socioeconomic status will learn and adapt to the behavior of people around them and emulate that behavior. Self-esteem and a sense of belonging play a role in the self-identification of that group.
When the behavior of an individual does not match that of a new target group, they will not be accepted or feel comfortable in that group since neither groups see eye to eye in the matching behavior. This is why it is difficult for citizens born into low socioeconomic status to naturally enter groups of high socioeconomic status since they did not grow up or learn the expected behavior nor do they identify with a sense of belonging in this group (this is where a sense of belonging and self-esteem come into play).
 
This is harmful since getting access to these groups when coming from a low economic status is already hard enough. Let’s follow through with this argument by following an example scenario of a student coming from a low-income household.
 
Immediately, they are enculturated and used to the lifestyle of a low-income lifestyle. This includes beliefs around money and “high society”, stereotypically low levels of cultural capital, and little access to good quality education meaning low human capital. However, hypothetically, this student gets access to a scholarship or the parents choose to invest and send the child to a private school where the majority of students are from a high socioeconomic status. Immediately, the child has access to increasing their cultural and human capital, as well as growing their connections and thereby social capital. This is when social identity and cognitive theory come into play. Despite having these opportunities, the student may still not identify with this group due to their intrinsic beliefs created by their upbringing.
 
In this situation, the child could acculturate themselves into this new society by emulating this new behavior with a lot of effort and break into the “high society” group. Another possibility is that they continue to carry through this new system with their identity of a student coming from a low socioeconomic position due to their set belief through the Social Identity Theory. In this hypothetical situation, the child has an opportunity to acculturate themselves into this “high society” to raise their human, social, and cultural capital in an effort to reach equity (Pierre, 1977). However, in “the real world” this is almost never the case. These groups are separated systematically and continue to create a further divide since funding across schools (primary and secondary as well as universities) does not work to reach equity.
 
Wealthy citizens have the money to pay for elite institutions that offer quality education and pave a path to good universities often leading to high income (again, not always the case but the most common case). They also have social capital through the network of others part of this high socioeconomic status. These relationships can further advance citizens to high-paying jobs due to intrinsic connections. Low-income citizens don't have the money to pay for elite institutions, cutting them off from high-quality education, a gateway to good universities and jobs, as well as creating connections that can land them a high-paying job. There are ways to get there (scholarships, financial aid programs, non-profit organizations…) but the American education system does not work in their favor thereby further creating a divide in the national income gap.
