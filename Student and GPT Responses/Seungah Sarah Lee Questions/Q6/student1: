Randall Collins explores Functional, Conflict and Institutional theories of educational stratification by breaking down the structure of schooling and the means through which educational institutions perpetuate existing social inequalities and inequities. Collins, in the chapter Functional and Conflict Theories of Educational Stratification, breaks down functional theory as one that dictates that particular occupational positions require specific skills which are theorized to be attainable through native ability or training within the educational system. Within the basis for this theory lies the main argument that demand for high skilled jobs has and continues to rise, increasing the need for educational requirements on the job market. Collins further highlights that theoretically, individuals with educational qualifications are highlighted as better performing employees. The criteria that dictates promotions possesses standards that inherently place educated individuals at an advantage, allowing them to thrive with fewer obstacles to the c-suite.
 
Within companies established by members of the elite, an elitist recognition system dictates the route to spaces of influence within the company, a system whose structure is taught rather earlier on in elite schools and universities. The author highlights that, “social origins have a direct impact on occupational success, even after the completion of education” (Collins 1971). I would argue that although there have been steps taken to improve the routes of low-income students and minorities into elitist spaces (scholarships, diversity initiatives etc.) these students are heavily encouraged to assimilate and integrate into the culture, perpetuating the dominating culture of the elite and essentially stifling and eventually erasing the cultures from which these students come. In primary and secondary local private schools in Zambia, students risk punishment by detention or physical labor for speaking any language other than English to their peers and their teachers. Not only does this teach students earlier on to erase their own cultural background in order to assimilate into one considered more acceptable, it perpetuates a colonial ideologies and narratives that were utilized to discriminate and stifle the progress of local Zambians for decades. Such principles are then carried on into upper secondary schools and universities, which inherently trickles into the work force. Ironically, public schools have classes for non-English speaking students. The curriculum is taught in Nyanja, Bemba and a list of other local Zambian languages. Therefore, students who attend public school have the freedom and flexibility to express their cultural backgrounds and ideologies, yet are disadvantaged compared to private school attendees who are instructed in English, the language utilized during national exams at grades 7, 9 and 12.
 
Collins further explains that, “case studies show that the operation of ethnic and class standards in employment is based not merely on skin color but on name, accent style of dress, manners and conversational abilities” (Noland and Bakke 1949; Turner 1952; Taeuber et al. 1996; Nosow 1956 qtd. Collins 1971), building on his argument that success in the workforce is outside pure technical skills theorized to have been obtained in the educational curriculum of elitist institutions. To contribute to Collins argument, yet offer a complementary train of thought, I’d like to highlight that the standards of employment in the “developed” world concretely set in elitism are quite different from the “developing” world in which elitism exists alongside severe structural and institutional damages. To elaborate, structural and institutional damages in this case refer to corruption (i.e. nepotism, fraud, etc.) that somewhat dictate the pace at which individuals rise up the ladder. Almost as a branch of Collins’s emphasis on the disproportionate amount of upper and middle-class family members in the American business elite circle (Collins 1971), members of the elite in countries with severe institutional and structural damage open doors for their counterparts or family members through corrupted promotions, opportunities and areas for career growth. For instance, individuals in members of parliament in Zambia have been found guilty of nepotism when hiring or appointing ministers, secretary generals and several other positions of political influence. These individuals belong to elite families, yet their positionality wasn’t necessarily created by the route of ‘elite school to elite university to elite job’. Most actually ceased their education at level 12 in secondary school. Yet, their names and wealthy backgrounds provided them with the social and financial capital to fund campaigns that led to their political position (or direct appointment without campaigning).
 
Lastly, I would like to highlight that very little is being done to address the subconscious biases that exist towards members of the non-elite groups. Diversity, equity and inclusion efforts tend to be quite performative in the sense that very few schools and companies take a critical look at their admission and recruitment process to highlight and erase potential requirements that exclude individuals of particular backgrounds. In addition, individuals of diverse backgrounds placed in elite institutions are pigeon holed into the role of diversity, equity and inclusion champions by their sense of responsibility to give back and bring more individuals of their background into these elite spaces. They are forced to speak of their experiences as members of their background, yet are still left to assimilate into the dominant work and school culture that perpetuates the very stratification that led to few members of them occupying that space. It’s quite evident that more work needs to be done on the side of the universities and companies that significantly contribute to the perpetuation of social stratification.
