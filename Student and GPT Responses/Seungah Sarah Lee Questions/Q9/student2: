Policies strive to create the arrangement in the social setting for reaching the best possible conditions for coexistence and further growth of the community. Educational policies with programs are not the exclusion from this principle, and they further have a lasting impact on the community and families’ lives. It is crucial to understand the role of family and community in supporting their children and these policies, while the same programs must encompass the cultural norms and values that will support this process.
Family and community have a determinative role in expanding or limiting educational access and outcomes for individuals. Recent studies prove the direct connection between the student’s performance and socio-cultural impact, and families with a local community can significantly affect their motivation to learn. The authors claim that: “school-aged children with involved fathers are higher academic achievers than those with absent fathers, they are more likely to get A’s, demonstrate better verbal and quantitative skills, achieve higher grade point averages, obtain higher scores on reading achievement, learn more in class, and tend to be better behaved at school” (Ridge & Jeon, 2020, p.727). This source signifies how the parents can influence their children’s inclination to become an excellent learners, though it also demonstrates their engagement as a decisive factor in the successful outcome. In turn, the community is a more complex social organization that tends to be not monolithic in terms of norms and cultural values, and it is necessary to maintain policies or programs to consolidate the families and other organizations in facilitating favorable conditions for education. 
Furthermore, policies and programs which focus on parental and community educational engagement are responsible for addressing issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion. Their role is to create the best conditions for facilitating and promoting these norms, and they further provide standards for reaching these outcomes. The study says: “The results suggest that collaborative partnerships between universities, their local communities and other stakeholders can lead to positive outcomes.” (Scull & Cuthill, 2010, p.72). It further suggests that policies, which address sociocultural issues, can significantly improve the students’ engagement in the educational process and create a supportive environment necessary for their success. Lack of these policies or awareness of the program can create problems for educational organizations that can lower learning outcomes. The document shares the following: “It is important to have school and district staff that understand (and where possible, reflect) the school community to help inclusive family engagement become standard practice” (Jacques & Villegas, 2018, p.6). This research highlights the importance of these policies in maintaining equity and inclusiveness in the featured setting. In turn, educators, as well as affected stakeholders, must understand them and follow the fundamental principles of these programs to reach the desired results.
Consequently, the featured discussion demonstrates the importance of policies in reaching the best educational outcomes, while families and communities must demonstrate awareness of the programs with their intentions. All these agents and factors create the whole system that strives to align different interests and goals by introducing specific guidelines. The stakeholders and organizations become responsible for the quality of these outcomes in regard to their commitment and engagement.
