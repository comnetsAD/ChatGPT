Family and community play a significant role in expanding or limiting educational access and outcomes for individuals. A child's family and community can provide support and resources that can help them succeed in school, such as access to books and educational materials, encouragement to pursue education, and financial support for college. On the other hand, a child's family and community can also present barriers to educational access and success, such as poverty, lack of access to quality schools, and discrimination.

Policies and programs that focus on parental and community educational engagement can help address issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion by providing support and resources to families and communities that may not have access to them otherwise. For example, programs that provide financial assistance for college, or that offer support and resources to help parents navigate the education system can help level the playing field for students from low-income families.

Additionally, programs that aim to increase parental and community engagement in education can also help to create a more inclusive and equitable educational environment. For example, programs that provide parent education and training on how to support their child's education can help to empower parents to advocate for their child's education and to become more involved in the education system.

Furthermore, community-based programs such as tutoring or mentoring can also help to improve educational outcomes for students from disadvantaged communities by providing additional support and resources that can help to close the achievement gap.

In summary, policies and programs that focus on parental and community educational engagement can play a key role in addressing issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion by providing support and resources to families and communities that may not have access to them otherwise, and by increasing parental and community engagement in education.
