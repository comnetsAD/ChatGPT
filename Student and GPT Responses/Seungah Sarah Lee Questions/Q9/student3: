How did Hancock school â€œbeat the odds'' while Alexander school failed to do so? are two examples of case studies that demonstrate how family and community involvement in learning can boost student achievement, lower absenteeism, and regain parents' faith in their children' education. Students with involved parents or family members perform better academically and on tests, have stronger social skills, and exhibit improved behavior which is something that all our community and the rest of the world need because it would significantly help to lower crime and poverty too. In particular, I'll argue the point that community participation is vital to the success of educational initiatives. Furthermore, I contend that effective communication between communities and schools promotes closer working relationships between parents and teachers, which improves access, lowers dropout rates, and boosts student registration. This communication also helps schools expand and improve the quality of their instruction. I'll also look at how concerns of fairness, diversity, and inclusion might be addressed by policies and/or programs that emphasize parental and community involvement in education.
 
The foundation of engaging families within the networks of communities, schools, and families is placed in the Ecological systems theory (Bronfenbrenner, 1977). This theory of ecological systems showed how such a variety of layered structures, ranging from nearby microsystems like the family and school to more distant relations like policies, neighborhoods, laws, and societal stereotypes, support and integrate early childhood development. According to the hypothesis, these models are specifically established in children's recent experiences (microsystems). In the interaction with the surrounding, cultural, and political framework (macrosystem) the importance of engaged partnerships between families and schools is thus represented in the basic support that a child's microsystems would contribute for their development and quality of education. It is crucial to use the ecological system of theory to show how family and community involvement positively affects both the evaluation of educational quality and the growth of it. The findings of the Maryellen research, Higher Education Research & Development, also underline and encourage the possibility of fruitful collaborations between universities, their surrounding communities, and other stakeholders. We will also discuss how strong parent-community-school ties contributed significantly to Hancock School's success. The resources available for teaching and improving the learning environment increase when parents and people of the community are involved in school activities. Teachers and principals can create a shared vision for school reform and collaborate to
accomplish the essential changes in the school when they establish trust with one another and with parents. Additionally, a network of interconnected adult connections among parents, teachers, and service providers can create a holistic environment in which kids are brought up to have a consistent set of expectations and behaviors. Communities can also provide the budgetary support systems, as well as the social and cultural values that schools and the students who attend them need to succeed and survive in modern society. However Strong school community relations have never been simple to achieve and keep up. One of the reasons was that there was no effective policy or program that involved schools, parents, students, community members, and the nearby organizations in the effective education of children and their families. An absence in support for school improvement, increased public involvement in and support of educational endeavors, and strengthened families and communities was caused mainly by the lack of effective policies and leadership. Alexander school is a good illustration of this. When we looked into why Alexander School failed, we discovered that no successful programs had been implemented to bring parents, community members, and school personnel together, whereas in Hancock, there had been breakfast gatherings held once a month to discuss various topics. Each school should aim to create and execute policies and programs that emphasize parental and community educational engagement and address issues of fairness, diversity, and inclusion for the advancement of education since doing so offers an opportunity to solve these challenges.
 
Family engagement strives for community. An example with parents about their children's academic progress and mutually supporting their learning; equitable family engagement refers to situations in which all kinds of families actively participate in their children's education. This frequently entails making sure that family interaction respects and meets the social, cultural, and language norms and requirements of families and students while also being equitable, inclusive, accessible, and culturally acceptable. Schools and communities that struggle with productively involving particular types of families particularly those from diverse ethnic or cultural origins and low socioeconomic status can try to solve family engagement disparities by taking into account the requirements of their local communities. When a school undergoes curriculum development or reform, policies and programs that emphasize parental and community educational engagement should also voice concerns of equality, diversity, and inclusiveness.
