Schools are increasingly emphasizing a multi-dimensional effort that brings the various stakeholders together in order for a successful education for the students. Families and communities, making up the microsystem, or the innermost circle of Bronfebrenner’s Ecological Systems Theory that immediately surrounds and directly shapes a student’s development, are more and more understood as pivotal actors outside the classroom who heavily influence educational access and outcomes of students. Byrk et al.’s (2010) five-part model of school reform, for example, has parent-community-school ties as one of the five subsystems. This essay explores the roles of family and community, and specifically how schools could engage communities to aid any deficiency in the role of family for educational access and outcomes.
 
One common way the role of family in their children’s education can be understood is through a class-differential framework. Lareau’s (2002) seminal work on social class and child rearing practices suggests that middle-class and working-class families have different styles of socializing their children, especially regarding the organization of daily life, the use of language, and the social connections the children acquire (p. 753). Educational circumstances such as access to extracurricular activities and level of parental interventions at the school could thus differ by socioeconomic status (SES) of the family. Calarco (2018)’s ethnographic study of mixed-class classrooms builds on this idea to reveal that such familial socialization carries over into the classroom and expands or limits educational experiences. For instance, middle-class students were “successful in using their requests to secure the support they desire” (pp. 94-95). They were often encouraged by their parents to actively ask for help from their teachers, and confident and insistent on asking for clarification on instructions and seeking help in doing academic tasks in the classroom. Working-class students, on the other hand, were hesitant to seek the teacher’s attention, to appear impolite by demanding for help when the teacher was occupied, or to ask multiple follow-up questions even if their initial question was not resolved. This pattern of less proactive assistance-seeking behavior resulted in working-class students receiving “less immediate attention and less complete information, (...) [and] faced greater challenges in completing their work accurately and on time” (p. 96).
 
In consideration of such class-based strategies and capacities in securing educational resources, studies suggest ways in which community support and resources can help alleviate the SES-based gaps. Lee and Zhou (2015), explains the “immigrant paradox”—or the exceptionally high intergenerational mobility of 1.5- and 2nd-generation immigrant children—specifically among Asian Americans, by pointing out that families of various Asian ethnic subgroups form a wider ethnic community in the U.S. context and establish the wealthier subgroups’ class advantage in the children’s education as shared “ethnic capital” (p. 9). For example, the authors found that working-class Vietnamese families benefit from the cultural capital of middle-class Chinese families, such as information about private tutoring and experiences with the school system, by being in the same “Asian American” ethnic community. However, Feliciano and Lanuza (2017) discuss that the “immigrant paradox” narrative itself is overstated because it does not take into account the pre-migration education level and social status of migrant parents which U.S. census data often fails to capture. Furthermore, there is a need for even further data disaggregation for Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) subgroups, as this ethnic category is highly economically diverse and even a loosely defined ethnic community does not include the most vulnerable minority subgroups.
 
A more concrete and institutional case of successfully leveraging community engagement to aid the lack of parent involvement and support in education can be found in the Raza Studies, a Mexican American ethnic studies program that was developed in a high school in Tuscon, Arizona, of which its story is well-archived in the critically acclaimed 2011 documentary film Precious Knowledge. This revolutionary ethnic studies curriculum, that significantly boosted attendance, GPAs, and college admissions statistics in this historically underfunded and underperforming, majority Mexican American school, finds its core values in culturally centered education, critical thinking, and importantly, affection and solidarity for the community (Anderson, 2016). In fact, their model of community engagement successfully fulfills the core components of establishing strong parent-community-school ties as Byrk et al. (2010) elaborates.
 
When the documentary feature a bustling event where teachers are going around the room hugging and welcoming parents and families of their students, chatting about their child’s progress and aspirations, and referring to people in the room as a family, it shows the school’s commitment to supporting parents to support their children’s learning by actively inviting them to be engaged, communicating in accessible language about education, and creating a solidarity between the school’s families (Palos, 2011, 21:39). The program also stems from a locally motivated and developed assessment of the community, in which they recognize that previous generations of the neighborhood were chronically undereducated due to a perceived disconnect between school curriculum and their cultural realities, as well as problematize the mainstream American narrative of poor Mexican American students as “lazy” and “disengaged” in school (6:30). The teachers thus understand the culture and community of the families, and their curricular dedication to critically engaging the students with real life issues of equity and inclusion faced by their communities emphasize strong partnership between community initiatives and the students (26:46).
