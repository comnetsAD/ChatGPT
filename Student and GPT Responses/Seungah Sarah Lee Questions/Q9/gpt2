Family and community play a significant role in expanding or limiting educational access and outcomes for individuals. Families, especially parents, have a direct impact on their children's educational experiences and outcomes. For example, parental involvement in a child's education, such as reading to them at home, monitoring their homework, and being involved in their school, has been linked to better academic performance and educational outcomes. Families also shape children's attitudes and expectations towards education, and they provide emotional, social and financial support to the child.

On the other hand, families and communities that experience poverty, discrimination, or other forms of marginalization may have limited resources and opportunities to support their children's education, which can negatively affect their educational outcomes.

Policies and programs that focus on parental and community educational engagement can address issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion by providing support and resources for families and communities to become more involved in their children's education. These can include programs that provide access to information, resources, and training for parents and families to better understand the education system and how to support their children's learning. Community programs that support families, such as after-school programs and adult education programs, can also help to improve educational outcomes for children and youth.

Additionally, policies and programs that focus on parental and community engagement can help to break down barriers and create more inclusive and equitable educational environments. This can be done by involving families and communities in decision-making processes, and creating opportunities for them to provide feedback and input on educational policies and programs. By involving families and communities in the education system, and providing them with the resources and support they need to be successful, it can help to create more equitable and inclusive educational opportunities for all students.
