If Conch Republic loses sales on other models because of the introduction of the new model, it would negatively affect the analysis. The expected sales figures for the new smartphone may not be as high as originally estimated, and the company may not be able to recoup the costs associated with developing and marketing the new model. Additionally, the fixed costs associated with the operation may be higher than anticipated if the company is not able to generate enough revenue from the new model to offset these costs. Furthermore, the depreciation schedule for the equipment and the net working capital would also be affected, resulting in a lower net present value and a higher payback period. Overall, the introduction of the new smartphone model would be less profitable for the company and may not be a viable investment.
