If Conch Republic loses sales on other models because of the introduction of the new model, it would negatively impact the financial analysis of the new smartphone. The estimated sales volumes used in the analysis would likely decrease, which would decrease the projected revenue and increase the projected costs. This would likely result in a decrease in the net present value of the new smartphone and potentially make the project less profitable or unprofitable. Additionally, it could also decrease the payback period and increase the internal rate of return. Overall, the loss of sales on other models would need to be considered and accounted for in the financial analysis of the new smartphone in order to make an accurate assessment of its profitability and potential success.
