If the introduction of the new model means that Conch Republic loses sales on other models, we should adjust the future cash flow to be lower than the current model to make up for the loss in sales of other models. If the loss in sales causes a large decrease in future cash flow, it will potentially make the NPV negative, but we would need more information to analyze this scenario to decide.
