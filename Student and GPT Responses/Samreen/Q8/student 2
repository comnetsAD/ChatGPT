In this case, we have an erosion where the acceptance of a new project is having side effects on reducing sales and cash flows of existing projects. These costs are incremental. We also need to take into consideration the opportunity costs, which is what we are losing and giving up in making this decision. This could be added to variable costs of the projects. So another sensitivity analysis on changing VC could be helpful in making an analysis. In this way, we could see how the return of the project change as we increase the VC.
