If Conch Republic loses sales on other models because of the introduction of the new model, it would have a negative impact on the analysis. This is because the projected sales figures for the new smartphone would likely be lower than the original estimates, which would result in lower revenue and potentially lower profits for the company. Additionally, the fixed costs for the operation would remain the same, which would increase the cost per unit for the new smartphone and further decrease profitability. The company would need to re-evaluate the expected sales figures and adjust the financial projections accordingly. They would also need to consider the costs associated with the lost sales on other models and the potential revenue impact that this would have on the company's bottom line.
