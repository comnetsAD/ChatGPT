1. First, the NPV is positive at more than $75 million which means that there is a net cash inflow or gain in shareholders' wealth, so we should accept the project.
2. Second, the IRR is 15.17% which is higher than the required rate of return at 12%, so we should also accept the project if we use IRR as a criteria to evaluate this project.
3. So far, two criterias agree with each other. We can look at the payback period for some more insights. The duration of the project is 9 years, but the payback period which means that time taken to recover the intial cost of the project is 4.05 years. At that point, the project breaks even and for the rest of the duration of the project, Bullck Gold Mining can reaps profit. 
4. Another criteria is the modified IRR calculated using the combination method which returns 13.29% as the MIRR. This is still higher than the required rate of return at 12%, so assuming reinvestment at opportunity cost = WACC, the project still returns higher rate than the goal.
5. Moreover, the profitability index is bigger than 1 which means for every $1 of investment, we create an addition of $0.1 in value. 
In conclusion, all of the criterias agree with each other that the company should open the mine.
