Yes, the company should open the mine. First and most importantly, the project has a positive NPV, suggesting that it will bring positive earnings and thus add value to the company. Secondly, we can see from the Profitability Index that for every 1 dollar of investment, the mine is expected to receive a 1.11 dollar of profit. 
The payback period gives us some indication that it is expected to take 4.05 years for the mine to recover its inital costs. However, it is worth noting that the project is expected to have a negative cash flow on the 9th year. This unconventional cash flow projection is in agreement to the prediction that after 8 years the mine will be completely mined. So ideally, the mine should open and be closed after 8 years, though needing close monitor of when exactly to close the mine.
