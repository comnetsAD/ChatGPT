Based on the analysis, it would be difficult to say whether the company should open the mine without having access to the spreadsheet. The spreadsheet would give us the payback period, internal rate of return, modified internal rate of return, and net present value of the proposed mine. These calculations would give us a better idea of the financial feasibility of the mine, and help us make a decision on whether to open it or not. However, it is worth noting that the company's required return is 12%, if the IRR or MIRR is higher than that, then the mine is a good investment.
