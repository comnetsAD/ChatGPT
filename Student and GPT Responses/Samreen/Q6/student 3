Based on my analysis, the company should open the mine. The project's life is 8 years, after which all the gold will be mined, and the payback period is less than that at 4.05 years. Additionally, the net present value is greater than zero and both the internal rate of return and MIRR are greater than 12%, the required return rate, which means that the returns from the project outweigh the costs of implementing it. Finally, the profitability index is greater than one at 1.11, which is another reason to open the mine since it means that for every dollar of investment in the project, the company benefits an additional $ 0.11.
