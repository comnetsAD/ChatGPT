Based on the analysis of the payback period, internal rate of return, modified internal rate of return, and net present value of the proposed mine, we can make a recommendation on whether the company should open the mine.
If the payback period is shorter than the expected life of the mine, it can be considered as a good investment.
If the IRR is higher than the required return rate of 12%, it can be considered as a good investment.
If the MIRR is higher than the required return rate of 12%, it can be considered as a good investment.
If the NPV is positive, it can be considered as a good investment.

Based on these calculations, if the payback period is less than 4 years, the IRR is greater than 12%, the MIRR is greater than 12%, and the NPV is positive, it can be considered as a good investment and the company should open the mine.
