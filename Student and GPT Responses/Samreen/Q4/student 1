1. Short-term solvency:
Both current ratio and quick ratio of S&S Air are higher than the median of the industry which means that the company has more short-term liquidity than industry. Its cash ratio is slightly lower than the median but higher than the lower quartile. All of the ratios are hovering around the median. This can be viewed positively relative to the industry as it shows that S&S Air is better at managing accounts or have more access to short-term borrowing than 50% of the industry, but can be viewed negatively because it shows that S&S Air has less very short-term liquidity than 50% of the companies in the industry and can lead to liquidity problems if it does not have enough assets to pay off the short term obligations.
2. Long-term solvency:
The turnover ratios are higher than the industry median, all the three turnovers are above the upper quartile which means that S&S Air is more efficient at generating revenues from its assets than 75% industry. This is very understandable since S&S Air builds aircraft to order and takes only 5 weeks to build one compared to the industry where it takes 1.5 year to build a commercial airplane. The financial leverage ratios (total debt ratio, debt-equity ratio, equity multiplier, times interest earned, cash coverage ratio), which show how much capital is coming in the form of debt, are less than the industry median. The lower financial leverage ratios are, the better it is for the company to secure debt in the future because it means that the company has lower financial risk than industry. The lower financial leverage ratios indicate that S&S Air is a financially responsible business with less debt and steady revenue."		3. Profitability:
Profit margin, ROA, and ROE are all less than industry median but higher than the lower quartile. Low profitability ratios are undesirable because it means that the company is bringing in inadequate revenue or has higher operating cost with the level of assets that it owns. Profit margin could be lower because they invest more into making their products better which have received reviews that they are safer and more reliable. Right now the profitability ratios can be viewed negatively because they are less profitable than the industry, but can be viewed positively that they have many areas to improve and lower cost to achieve higher profit margin, ROA and ROE.

If there is an inventory ratio, S&S Air's ratio would be also around the industry median or more likely slightly lower than the industry median. Since both current and quick ratio are slightly higher than the median, but the cash ratio is lower than the median and inventory is the least liquid current asset, the inventory ratio proposed would be lower than the median.
Overall, S&S Air seems to be doing well financially. While the short-term liquidity ratios are slightly lower than the industry's median which will require more investigation, the turnover ratios are higher than the industry's median (more efficient) and the financial leverage ratios are lower than the industry median (less financial risk). Moreover, the lower profitability ratios means that the company has potential to improve their profit margin significantly and raise their profit.
