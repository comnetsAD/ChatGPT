If I were to create a inventory ratio of (inventory/current liabilities), it would be slightly higher than the industry median. This is because current ratio = (CA/CL) and quick ratio =(CA-inventory)/CL, so the inventory ratio would be the difference between the current ratio and the quick ratio. Since S&S Air has slightly higher than median in both these two ratios, we could predict that the inventory ratio would also be slightly higher than median of the industry or at least somewhere around the industry median.
