Comparing S&S Air's performance to the industry, we can see that the company's current ratio is lower than the lower quartile of the industry, indicating that the company may not have enough current assets to cover its short-term liabilities. The quick ratio, cash ratio, and total debt ratio are also lower than the lower quartile of the industry, indicating that the company may have difficulty meeting its short-term obligations. On the other hand, the inventory turnover and receivables turnover ratios are higher than the upper quartile of the industry, indicating that the company is efficiently managing its inventory and collecting on its accounts receivable. The return on assets and return on equity are also higher than the upper quartile of the industry, indicating that the company is generating a high return on its assets and equity.

If we calculate the ratio of inventory to current liabilities, S&S Air's ratio would be relatively low compared to the industry average. This would suggest that the company has a relatively low level of liquidity and may not have enough current assets to cover its short-term liabilities.
