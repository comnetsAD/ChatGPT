S&S Air has a current ratio that is higher than that of the industry, which is a positive thing as it shows that it has a higher short-term liquidity than the industry. It also has a quick ratio that is higher that the industry median, which is also a positive thing because it means that the company is more able to cover its short-term liabilities using only cash or near-cash assets, not including inventory. However, a negative finding is that its cash ratio is below the median of the industry, showing that it has a lower short-term liquidity in terms of only cash than the industry average. The company is doing well in terms of total asset turnover, inventory turnover, and receivables turnover, all of which are higher than the upper quartile of the industry. That signifies that its company assets are much more efficient at generating sales, that it sold off its inventory more often than other companies in the industry, and recovered payment on sales more often. Its total debt and debt-to-equity ratios are below the industry median, however, showing that the company is less leveraged than others in the industry on average and that the company's assets are less financed by debt. Because the ratios are still above the lower quartile, though, this isn't necessarily a negative thing since companies being more leveraged puts them at a greater risk of default. The company's equity multiplier is also less than the industry median but above the lower quartile, showing that the portion of the company's assets financed by equity is lower than the industry average. Given the fact that the company already has a less than average amount of debt to finance its assets, this finding is negative because the company would need to finance more, not less assets, through equity than the industry average to compete with others. S&S Air is able to cover its interest payments less times with its pre-tax earnings than the industry on average as seen by how both its Times Interest earned ratio and cash coverage ratio are lower than the industry median and higher than its lower quartile, an undoubtedly negative finding. Its profit margin is also lower than the industry average, which is a negative thing because it means that it is generating less profit per dollar in sales than the industry average. The same negative finding can be said about its profit generated per dollar of assets since its return on assets is lower than the industry average. Lastly, its return on equity is lower than the industry average. This is a negative thing because it means that its profit generated per dollar of equity is lower than the industry average, which could decentivize investors from buying shares in the company.
