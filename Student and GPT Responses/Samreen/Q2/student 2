The expansion plan could be risky as it requires a significant investment. We saw from the Cash Flow analysis that the company has a positive OCF ($207,460), but this is money going into daily operations and business activities, which could not be used for expansion. This can be seen from the change in Net Capital Spending of $121,747, suggesting the company is already investing a lot of OCF to fuel its day to day business. This could be an area of interest for investors to see where the capital spending is investing in.
Tad is planning to finance the investment with a combination of additional funds drom outsider and money borrowed from banks. We saw in 2022, the company is already paying back more of its long term debts than it is borrowing new ones. This could be a promising sign for new creditors and investors. New borrowings are also needed in terms of growth, so without the expansion plan the company could find it harder to achieve growth.
