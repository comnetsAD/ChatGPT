I believe the expansion plans are within reach for the company, seeing as how its operations are generating enough cash to cover their repayments to both creditors and investors, which would incentivize banks and investors to give it loans. The significant investments on fixed assets show that the company may have enough fixed assets to manufacture the additional surfboards needed during the expansion as well.
