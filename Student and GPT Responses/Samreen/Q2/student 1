Tad's expansion plan can be divided into two operations: opening a new location and wholesaling his boards to other sellers. Sunset has a positive cash flow which is considered healthy as the business has cash to react and adapt to the market. However, with Tad's expansion plan, Sunset would be entering a new market (wholesaling surfboards) and setting up a new location would require a large amount of fixed cost which Tad intended to finance with debt from the bank. Significant new equity needs to be raised and with the increasing fixed cost, Sunset would not be able to have such a high dividend payout ratio. Sunset's set of competitors also become larger as they would need to compete with both retail and wholesale surfboard businesses. For the wholesale venture to be successful, Tad needs to make sure that as he increases the volume of surfboards produced, the COGS or cost of each board has to go down significantly, else he would be trading off profit margin for more volumes. We need more information regarding the cost of manufacturing to decide if wholesaling is a feasible expansion plan. Moreover, he would also need to consider if he needs to buy more equipments, machines (increasing fixed cost) and have the capacity to produce more boards. The wholesaling venture is more risky and has more factors to consider than expanding to a new location. Since his brand already has the reputation among the professional surfers, if he chooses the right location with the same demographics and ideally the same geographical features, Sunset would benefit more ie. increasing both the value of intangible asset (brand name) and the volume of sales.
