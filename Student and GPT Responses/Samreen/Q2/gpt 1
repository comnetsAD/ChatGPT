Without a detailed analysis of the company's financial statements and cash flows, it is difficult to fully evaluate the feasibility of Tad's expansion plans. However, some potential concerns that may arise include:

The company's lack of financial record keeping and organization may make it difficult to secure funding from new investors or banks.
The company's current profitability and cash flow may not be sufficient to support the expansion plans.
The company's ability to manage the additional costs and responsibilities associated with opening a new store and supplying surfboards to other sellers may also be a concern.
It would be important for Tad and Jameson to carefully consider these and other potential risks before moving forward with the expansion plans.
