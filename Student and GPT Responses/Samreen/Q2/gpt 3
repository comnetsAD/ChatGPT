In light of the information provided, it appears that Sunset Boards' financial situation is stable, and the company has a positive cash flow. However, without more detailed financial information, it's difficult to accurately assess the company's overall financial health, and it's hard to make a conclusion about the expansion plans. I would recommend that Jameson, the financial analyst, conducts a more detailed analysis of the company's financials before making any recommendations to Tad regarding the expansion plans. It's important to consider the company's liquidity, profitability, and solvency, as well as the market conditions, competition, and the company's capacity to expand.
