The internal growth rate is the rate of growth that a company can achieve through the reinvestment of its earnings without the need to raise additional capital. It is calculated as the return on equity multiplied by the retention ratio. The sustainable growth rate is the maximum rate of growth that a company can achieve without having to raise additional capital. It is calculated as the return on equity multiplied by the retention ratio and subtracted by the dividend payout ratio.
