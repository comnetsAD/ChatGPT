I would not choose Boeing as an aspirant company, because it cannot provide a good indication on S&S Air's performance. S&S Air is a small company and its has only 2 model of airplanes that it is currently selling. Whereas, Boeing is amongst the top 2 aircraft manufacturers in the industry. The difference in size means that the nature of the two business are very different and their financial statements would look very different although they belong to the same industry. Boeing also has advantages such as economies of scale, and longer pay periods that S&S Air would not be able to enjoy. 
S&S Air is manufacturing light, small airplaines and selling them directly to personal owerners. This is very different to commercial aircrafts that Boeing is selling, just the manufacturing time differ between 5 weeks to 1-2 years between the two type of aircrafts. The nature of products differ meaning that S&S Air and Boeing would have very different components of current assets, liabilities and working capital. In addition, Boeing participates in rockets, satellites and telecommunications, and also provides leasing services. These products also differ to purely aircraft. Thus Boeing is not suitable for neither comparison nor a target to work to.

A better aspirant company would be Cirrus Aircraft, which is a US company that designs and manufactures personal light aircrafts. The company is still larger in size and has a well established brand comparing to S&S Air, which needs to be taken into consideration.
