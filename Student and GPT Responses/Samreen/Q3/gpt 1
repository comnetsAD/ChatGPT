Whether or not to choose Boeing as an aspirant company depends on the specific goals and objectives of S&S Air. While Boeing is a well-known and reputable company in the aerospace industry, it may not be the best comparison for a small niche company like S&S Air that specializes in light airplanes for individual customers. A more appropriate aspirant company would likely be a similar sized company in the light airplane manufacturing industry.
