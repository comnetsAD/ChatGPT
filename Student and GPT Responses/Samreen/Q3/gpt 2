It would not be appropriate to choose Boeing as an aspirant company for S&S Air because Boeing is a commercial aircraft company, while S&S Air is a niche market light airplane manufacturer. The operations and financials of the two companies are vastly different, and comparing them would not provide a meaningful measure of S&S Air's performance.
