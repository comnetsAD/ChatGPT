I would not choose Boeing as an aspirant company, because an aspirant company should be operationally comparable to S&S Air in order to have its financial statements and ratios be comparable as well. Boeing is larger than S&S Air, so it would only be rational for its sales, net income, assets, equity, and debt be larger than S&S Air as well. Bearing that in mind, comparing the two companies would show S&S Air as inferior even though that might not be the case. Additionally, S&S Air produces small planes for individual-use while Boeing manufactures larger aircrafts for commercial and defense purposes, which puts the two companies in different markets despite being in the small industry, thus making their financial ratios less comparable.
