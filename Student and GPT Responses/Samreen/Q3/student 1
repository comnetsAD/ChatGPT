I would not choose Boeing as the aspirant company for S&S Air. While both in the same airplane manufacturing industry, they have different customer demographics and very different products. S&S Air builds small aircraft and sells to a niche market where its customers own and fly their own airplanes, while Boeing is a commerical aircraft company who produces large airplanes and sells in bulk to airlines and government. These are very different markets and the nature and size of two businesses are not similar at all, so comparing Boeing's ratio with S&S Air is not a good analysis on S&S Air's performance.
