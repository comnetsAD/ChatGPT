It is a bit concerning for the operating cash flow of the company to have declined from 2021 to 2022 since it means that there is less readily available cash for company operations. The company has a good balance between the repayment of funding from creditors and funding from stockholders, who finance the purchase of assets, as seen by how the cash outflows to creditors and stockholders are close in value. The cash generated from the company's activities amounts to 68,792, or the cash flow from assets, which is equivalent to the sum of the cash used to pay creditors, 31,992, and that paid out to the owners of the firm, 36,801, or the cash flow to stockholders. There is significant spending on fixed assets as the capital spending is 121,747. Finally, the company has a net investment of 16,921 in net working capital for the year 2022.
