Sunset Boards' cash flow from assets are positive which indicates that a company's liquid assets are increasing, enabling it to cover other obligations, reinvest, pay expenses, and even pay back to its stockholders. The majority of Sunset Boards's cash flow comes from operating activities, so we know that the core business of manufacturing and selling surfboards is doing very well and generating most of the cash for the business. We can see that Sunset's cash flow to creditors are positive which means they managed to pay off some of their debts to bondholders, and the positive cash flow to debitors means that its stockholders are receiving a lot of dividends and the business paid their stockholders. In 2022, we see that there is new equity of $14511 raised and their capital spending is almost half of the operating cash flow which is relatively high as most of the S&P 500 companies have their capital expenditure around 21% of their revenue. However, this is not very alarming or bad, since all of their cash flows are positive which means the business is viable and has potential to make more profit in the future.
