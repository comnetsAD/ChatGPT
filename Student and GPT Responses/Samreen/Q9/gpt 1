Based on the information provided, it would be recommended that the company issue debt to finance the land purchase in order to maximize its total market value. Kim Weyand, the company's new CFO, has determined that the company's current cost of capital is 12.5 percent and believes that the company would be more valuable if it included debt in its capital structure. Additionally, it has been stated that the company can issue bonds at par value with a coupon rate of 8 percent and a capital structure in the range of 70 percent equity/30 percent debt would be optimal.

Furthermore, the purchase of the land is expected to increase the company's annual pretax earnings by $14 million in perpetuity, which will lead to a positive impact on the company's market value. By issuing debt, the company can take advantage of the tax benefit of interest payments, which will be deductible from the company's income, leading to a reduction in the overall tax liability.

It's important to note that the company should not go beyond 30 percent debt, as that would lead to a lower bond rating and much higher coupon rate, which could lead to financial distress and associated costs.
