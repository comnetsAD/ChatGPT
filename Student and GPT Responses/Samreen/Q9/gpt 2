It would be beneficial for Stephenson Real Estate to issue debt to finance the land purchase in order to maximize its total market value.

There are a few reasons for this recommendation:

	The company's current cost of capital is 12.5 percent, which is higher than the coupon rate of 8 percent that Kim Weyand believes the company can issue bonds at. By issuing debt, the company would be able to lower its cost of capital, which would increase its net present value and therefore its market value.

	Kim Weyand believes that a capital structure in the range of 70 percent equity/30 percent debt would be optimal for the company. By issuing debt, the company would be able to move closer to this optimal capital structure, which would increase its market value.

	The company has a 21 percent corporate tax rate. By issuing debt, the company would be able to take advantage of the tax deductibility of interest payments, which would reduce its effective cost of capital and increase its market value.

It's important to note that this decision should be made only after careful evaluation of the company's ability to service the debt and the overall risk profile of the company. Additionally, the company should consider the potential impact on its credit rating and the associated costs of issuing debt. Overall, if the company can service the debt and the overall risk profile of the company is not affected negatively, it would be beneficial for Stephenson Real Estate to issue debt to finance the land purchase in order to maximize its total market value.
