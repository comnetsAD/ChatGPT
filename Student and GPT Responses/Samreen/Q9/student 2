I would recommend Stephenson to issue debt to finance the land purchase. This is because debt is not always harmful to the company. Interest payment is tax deductable, meaning that debt is only taxed once while equity is double taxed. If Stephenson introduce some debt as the company's capital structure, this would decrease the company's tax payments. This is also referred to as creating a tax shield, which increases after-tax net income and the total value of the company. Thus, it is favourable to introduce debt and finance the land purchase through debt.
