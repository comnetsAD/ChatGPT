It would be recommended for Stephenson to issue debt to finance the land purchase. This is because issuing debt would result in a lower cost of capital than issuing equity.

The cost of capital for equity is calculated as the return shareholders expect to receive on their investment, which is the company's expected rate of return. In this case, Kim Weyand has determined that the company's current cost of capital is 12.5 percent.

The cost of capital for debt, on the other hand, is the coupon rate on the bonds, which is 8 percent. This is lower than the company's cost of capital for equity, making it more favorable to issue debt.

Additionally, Kim Weyand believes that a capital structure of 70 percent equity/30 percent debt would be optimal for the company. This means that the company would have a lower risk of financial distress and the associated costs, which would also make it more favorable to issue debt.

However, it should be noted that the company would need to pay interest on the debt and would also be subject to the corporate tax rate of 21 percent, which would lower the net income and return on investment. Therefore, the company should carefully evaluate the trade-offs before making a decision.
