Stephenson should finance the land purchase with debt financing because of 3 reasons:
     * Interest payments are tax deductible and thereby decrease the taxable income. 
     * Debt in capital structure provides a tax shield which will increase the value of the firm. 
    * With equity financing, the earnings would have to be divided amongst more number of shareholders which will decrease the value of the firm.
