To maximize the per-share stock price of Stephenson's equity, the company should issue debt to entirely finance the project and maintain a capital structure of 70 percent equity/30 percent debt.

Kim Weyand's analysis shows that the company's cost of capital is 12.5 percent, which is higher than the 8 percent coupon rate that the company can get from issuing bonds. By issuing debt, the company can take advantage of the lower cost of borrowing to increase its earnings and ultimately, its stock price.

Furthermore, maintaining a capital structure of 70 percent equity/30 percent debt is optimal as it balances the risk of financial distress with the potential increase in earnings. A higher percentage of debt would increase the risk of financial distress and result in a lower bond rating and higher coupon rate.

Finally, by issuing debt and maintaining a 70/30 capital structure, the company can also take advantage of the corporate tax rate to further increase its earnings and ultimately, its stock price.
