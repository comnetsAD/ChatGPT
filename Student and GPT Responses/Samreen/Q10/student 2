Financing through debt maximized the per-share stock price of Stephenson's equity. This can be seen in the calculations done in part 3 and 4. Part 3 shows that if Stephenson finances through equity, the share price remains the same at $49.20 comparing to before. Whereas, in part 4, we see that financing through debt increases the share price from $49.20 to $50.77. Therefore, financing through debt maximizes the company's stock price per share.
