Debt Financing because of these 3 reasons:
     * The current capital structure (100% equity financing) is not optimal as the optimal debt weight is 30%, so as long as debt has not exceeded 30% in the capital structure, more debt financing will increase the stock price. The optimal capital structure minimizes cost of equity, cost of debt, and WACC and simultaneously maximizes stock price. In Question 3, if we use equity financing, the stock price is $49.20, but if we use debt financing, the stock price increases to $50.77 in Question 4
    * Debt financing also allows the company more freedom to take control of their destiny
   * The interest payments from debt financing are tax-deductible, so the company can and will try to apply for a loan that has more favorable terms.
