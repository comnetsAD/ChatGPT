To determine which method of financing maximizes the per-share stock price of Stephenson’s equity, we need to calculate the incremental increase in the company's value from each method of financing and compare them.

	Financing the project with equity only: The purchase of the land is expected to increase Stephenson’s annual pretax earnings by $14 million in perpetuity. The company's cost of capital is 12.5%, so the present value of the expected earnings is $14 million / 0.125 = $112 million. Since the company has 8.7 million shares of common stock outstanding, the per-share stock price increase would be $112 million / 8.7 million = $12.80 per share.

	Financing the project with debt: The company can issue bonds at par value with a coupon rate of 8%. The company's cost of capital is 12.5%, so the present value of the expected earnings is $14 million / 0.125 = $112 million. The company would need to raise $65 million in debt to finance the project, and the annual interest payments would be $65 million x 0.08 = $5.2 million. The company's pretax earnings would be reduced by the interest payments, but it would also benefit from the tax shield from the interest payments (21% x $5.2 million = $1.092 million). The net increase in the company's value would be $112 million - $5.2 million + $1.092 million = $108.292 million. Since the company has 8.7 million shares of common stock outstanding, the per-share stock price increase would be $108.292 million / 8.7 million = $12.487 per share.

From the calculations above, it can be seen that financing the project with equity only maximizes the per-share stock price of Stephenson’s equity. The per-share stock price increase would be $12.80 per share, compared to $12.487 per share if the project is financed with debt.
