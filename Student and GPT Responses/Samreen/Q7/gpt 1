To determine whether Conch Republic should produce the new smartphone, a financial analysis should be conducted to evaluate the potential profitability of the project. This analysis would include estimating the net present value (NPV) of the project, which compares the present value of the cash flows generated by the project to the initial investment. Other factors to consider would be the payback period, internal rate of return (IRR) and profitability index.

In this case, Conch Republic will need to invest $41.5 million for the necessary equipment, and will have to spend $5.4 million in fixed costs per year. The estimated sales figures for the new smartphone are 67,000, 108,000, 93,000, 86,000, and 55,000 per year for each of the next five years, respectively. With these inputs, the NPV of the project can be calculated and compared to the required return of 12 percent. If the NPV is positive, it would indicate that the project is profitable and should be pursued.
