Yes, Conch Republic should produce the new smartphone. We can see that the project has a positive NPV of $22,566,864. So it is predicted to add value to the company and have a positive return. The profitability index is 1.544, suggesting that for every 1 dollar of investment the project is estimated to earn 1.544 dollar of profit. These numbers are good and showing that the manager should accept the project. The payback period is 2.675, so it is predicted that in 2.675 years the initial cost will be covered. 
Moreover, from the sensitivity analysis we see that the project is more sensitive to a change in 1 unit of price than in 1 unit of sales. If we want to predict for the worst case scenario where sales is low in the future years, we are able to know that with 1 unit decrease in sales, the NPV is predicted to decrease by $851, and if sales are 100 units lower every year, the NPV is still positive and high ($22,652,016). This is not a very significant change from the base case. So the project's return is not very sensitive to future changes, and thus risk is not very high.
