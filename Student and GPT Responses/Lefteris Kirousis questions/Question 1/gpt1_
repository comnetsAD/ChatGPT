It is possible for there to exist a set of men and women with preference lists such that every perfect matching has a strong instability.
For example, consider the case where there are 2 men and 2 women and both men and women have the same preference list, where they both have a tie between the two members of the opposite gender as their first preference, and the other member as their last preference.
In this case, the perfect matching of (m1,w1) and (m2,w2) would have strong instability, as both men would prefer the other woman, and both women would prefer the other man.
On the other hand, the Gale-Shapley algorithm is guaranteed to find a perfect matching with no strong instability. The algorithm proceeds by having the men propose to their top choice, and if a woman receives more than one proposal, she chooses the man she prefers the most and rejects the others. The rejected men then move on to their next choice, and the process repeats until every man and woman is matched with someone. This algorithm is guaranteed to find a stable matching because it ensures that no man or woman can be matched with someone they strictly prefer over their current match.
