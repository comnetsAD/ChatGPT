The Stable Matching Problem with ties is known as the Stable Roommates Problem (SRP). It is known that the SRP does not always have a solution with no strong instability. One example of a set of men and women with preference lists that has no perfect matching with no strong instability is the following:
Men: m1, m2, m3
Women: w1, w2, w3
m1: w1 > w2 > w3
m2: w2 > w3 > w1
m3: w3 > w1 > w2
w1: m1 > m2 > m3
w2: m2 > m3 > m1
w3: m3 > m1 > m2
In this case, every perfect matching has a strong instability, as each man and woman prefers their partner's partner to themselves.
However, if the preferences are acyclic there exists an algorithm called Top Trading Cycles algorithm, which is guaranteed to find a perfect matching with no strong instability. The algorithm repeatedly finds a cycle of men and women who would prefer to be matched with each other, and then "trades" them so that each person gets their first choice. It can be proven that the algorithm terminates with a stable matching, and that the matching produced is always stable.
