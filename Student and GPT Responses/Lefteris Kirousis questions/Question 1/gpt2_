It is not guaranteed that a perfect matching with no strong instability will always exist when ties are allowed in the ranking. An example of a set of men and women with preference lists for which every perfect matching has a strong instability is if there are 2 men and 2 women and both men and women have the same preference list where they both have a tie between the two members of the opposite gender as their first preference, and the other member as their last preference. In this case, any perfect matching will have strong instability as both men would prefer the other woman, and both women would prefer the other man.
However, the algorithm "Top Trading Cycles algorithm (TTC)" is guaranteed to find a perfect matching with no strong instability in the case of ties. The algorithm proceeds by finding cycles of mismatched pairs (m,w) such that m prefers w over his current match and w prefers m over her current match. And then, each pair in the cycle is matched with their top choice from the cycle. This algorithm terminates in finite time and guarantees no strong instability.
