The algorithm I would propose for this problem is a linear time prune and search algorithm that uses a divide and conquer approach. The basic idea behind the algorithm is to pair the cards in an arbitrary way and then use the equivalence tester to determine if the two cards in each pair are equivalent. If they are, we keep one of the cards and discard the other. If they are not, we discard both cards. We repeat this process until we have a small number of cards remaining.
The first step of the algorithm is to divide the collection of n cards into pairs. If n is odd, we can simply pair the first n-1 cards and leave the last card un-paired.
Next, we use the equivalence tester to determine if the two cards in each pair are equivalent. If they are, we keep one of the cards and discard the other. If they are not, we discard both cards. We repeat this process until we have a small number of cards remaining.
At this point, we have a small number of cards remaining, and we can use the equivalence tester to check if all of these cards are equivalent. If they are, we have found a set of more than n/2 cards that are equivalent to one another. If they are not, we can conclude that there is no set of more than n/2 cards that are equivalent to one another.
To prove that this algorithm works, we can use a proof by contradiction. Suppose that the majority of cards are equivalent, but the algorithm does not find a set of more than n/2 cards that are equivalent to one another. This would imply that the majority of the cards were discarded during the pruning process, which is a contradiction. Therefore, if the majority of cards are equivalent, the algorithm will find a set of more than n/2 cards that are equivalent to one another.
To handle the case when n is odd, we simply pair the first n-1 cards and leave the last card un-paired. After pruning the cards, if we have an odd number of cards remaining, we can simply check if the last card is equivalent to the majority of the remaining cards.
Overall, this algorithm is linear in time because we are only pairing and testing the cards once, and the number of remaining cards after pruning decreases with each iteration. Additionally, this algorithm is guaranteed to find a representative of the majority of equivalent cards, if it exists, due to the divide and conquer approach and the proof by contradiction.
