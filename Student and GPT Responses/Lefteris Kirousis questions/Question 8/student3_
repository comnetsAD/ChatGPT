Assuming we have n cards across the pairs, and a majority of equivalent cards, we must have at least n/2 + 1 equivalent cards. If we pair n cards into n/2 pairs, then necessarily at least one pair must contain both cards that are equivalent to the majority, by the Pigeonhole Principle. Consider the case where at least one card in each pair is equivalent to the majority card. From each pair that contains an equivalent card, we prune away at most 1 equivalent card. Since there are n/2 pairs, we can get rid of at most n/2 equivalent cards through the pruning. Thus, we must be left with at least 1 equivalent card in the worst case, if all other cards get pruned, and 1 is a majority out of 1 total card.  If we are left with more than one card, all the remaining cards will be the majority card.
Aside from the worst case, where we assume the majority card is part of every pair, we know the majority card has to be in more than half of the pairs. If we have n/2 pairs, then at least floor(n/4) +1 pairs must contain the majority card. Assume all majority cards are paired together, in the worst case, and there are m majority cards. There are at most m/2 pairs where both are majority cards, and at most 1 majority card can be pruned from each pair, so we are left with at least m/2 majority cards. Since we know that m is greater than half of the starting number of cards, we know that m/2 is greater than half of the remaining number of cards, since each pair of cards must prune off at least 1 card.
Therefore, if there was a majority of equivalent cards in the beginning pairs, there will be a majority of equivalent cards in the remaining part, and the majority of equivalent cards in the remaining part will be equivalent to the majority of equivalent cards at the beginning.
 
                    	In the even case, the algorithm would recursively prune to either arrive at 1 remaining card, or no remaining cards. If one card is left, that card should be compared to the other remaining cards to see if it is equal to at least half of them. If so, it should be returned as the majority. If not, the algorithm should return that there is no majority card. If there are no cards left, return no majority.
                    	In the odd case, one card should be taken out and remain unmatched, so the remaining even number of cards can be paired and pruned. If the pruning returns a majority card according to the process above, this card should be checked against the other remaining cards, and returned as the majority if it is equivalent to at least half. If not, the unmatched card should be checked to see if it is equal to at least half the remaining cards, and returned as the majority if so. Otherwise, it should return no majority.
                    	The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n). The pairing and pruning at each level has a cost proportional to the number of cards at that level, with each level having at most half the number of cards as the previous. So, the worst-case total cost of pairing and pruning across all levels is proportional to n + n/2 + n/4 + … = 2n, which is O(n). In the worst case, the potential linear searches at each level to check the remainder card against the other cards would also have total summed cost of n + n/2 + n/4 + … = 2n. So, the total cost of the algorithm is worst case proportional to 2n + 2n = 4n, which is O(n).
