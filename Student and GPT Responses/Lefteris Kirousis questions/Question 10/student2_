For instance, the graph which locates within (v1, v5) and the graph edges starts with v1 then v2 so, (v1, v2), (v1, v3), (v2, v5), (v3, v4), and (v4, v5). The algorithm gets back the path of edges (v1, v2) and (v2, v5) with value of 2 whereas the optimum is 3 for the path (v1, v3), (v3, v4), and (v4, v5).
