No, it is not possible to have an optimal scheduling of jobs that minimizes lateness yet contains an inversion.
An optimal schedule is one that minimizes the lateness of jobs while also adhering to the constraints of the problem, such as deadlines and processing times. Inverting the order of two jobs on a machine means that the job that should be finished first according to their deadlines is actually finished after the other job, which would cause lateness.
Therefore, an optimal schedule should not contain any inversions, as it would result in increased lateness and violate the constraints of the problem. While it's possible to schedule jobs in a way that contains inversions, it would not be considered optimal as it would not minimize lateness and violates the problem constraints.
