Consider the graph with five nodes: 1,2,3,4,5,6 and edges: 1->2, 2->5, 1->3, 3->4 and 4->5.
Using this graph, the algorithm will output L = 2 since it chooses the following path: 1− > 2− > 5. However, the value L output by the algorithm on this graph is wrong since by observing the graph above we can clearly say that the longest path has length= 3 and is the path 1− > 3− > 4− > 5.
