To find the shortest paths from s to any other node t after the lengths of the edges are replaced by 2le + 1, one approach would be to use Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm with a small modification. Instead of relaxing the edges by subtracting the weight of an edge from the tentative distance of the destination vertex, we would relax the edges by dividing the weight of an edge by the tentative distance of the destination vertex. This would ensure that the shortest paths are found even after the lengths of the edges are replaced by 2le + 1.
