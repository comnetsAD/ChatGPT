To find the shortest paths from s to any other node t, assuming the lengths of the edges are replaced by 2le + 1, we would use a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm. The modification would be in the way we calculate the "key" of a vertex in the priority queue. Instead of using the distance from the source vertex s, we would use (2le + 1) times the distance from the source vertex s. This would ensure that the algorithm takes into account the new weights on the edges when determining the shortest paths. The rest of the algorithm would remain the same, we will repeatedly select the vertex v from the priority queue with the smallest key, and update the key of all vertices adjacent to v, by relaxing the edge(v,u).
