Although a strong form of Whorf’s idea, that language determines the way we think, is too extreme, language does influence the way we think. Words define our mental categories, drive our thoughts, and influence how we think about the scene. One typical research example is that although it used to be taught that in English when you are writing in the singular, just use the word “he”, people always picture a male when hearing the generic “he”. Similarly, language influences our thinking about numbers, colors, and even different senses of self and our social world. Besides, as different languages embody different ways of thinking, immersion in bilingual education can enhance thinking.
