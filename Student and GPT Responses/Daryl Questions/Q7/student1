German and Spanish speakers have gender for nouns. Native German and Spanish speakers were brought into a lab and ask to describe the words key and bridge. The word key is masculine in German and feminine in Spanish. German speakers described the key as heavy, hard, metal, jagged, and useful while Spanish speakers described it as gold, shiny, tiny, lovely, and intricate.

German speakers described the bridge as beautiful, elegant, and fragile. Spanish speakers described the bridge as big, dangerous, long, and strong.
