Based on the idea of the Whorf hypothesis, which states that language influences thought, we may have unconscious assumptions when speaking and thinking based on the structure and rules of our languages. For example, the gender of a noun in a person's native tongue would influence the way they describe that noun. The word "key" is masculine in German, but feminine in Spanish. German speakers would be more likely to describe a key using words that are associated with masculinity, such as "hard" and "jagged" while Spanish speakers would likely say words that channel femininity, such as "lovely" and "tiny" to describe a key even when the prompts were in English. For other words, where the German word was feminine and the Spanish masculine like for “bridge”, then the phenomenon worked inversely.
