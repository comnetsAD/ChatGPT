Experiment: The effect of breakfast on attention during morning lectures

Independent variable: Whether or not the student eats breakfast before the lecture

Condition 1: The student eats breakfast before the lecture
Condition 2: The student does not eat breakfast before the lecture
Dependent variable: Attention during the lecture

Operationalized as: The number of distractions during the lecture, as recorded by the student using a distraction log.

Hypothesis: Eating breakfast before the lecture will result in fewer distractions during the lecture, indicating better attention.

Experimental Design:
Recruit a sample of students who are willing to participate in the study
Randomly divide the students into two groups: one group that will eat breakfast before the lecture, and one group that will not eat breakfast before the lecture.
Provide all students with a distraction log and instruct them to record any distractions they experience during the lecture.
Conduct the same lecture for both groups of students on the same day at the same time.
Collect the distraction logs from both groups of students.
Analyze the data by comparing the mean number of distractions for the group that ate breakfast with the mean number of distractions for the group that did not eat breakfast.

This experimental design allows us to test the effect of breakfast on attention during morning lectures by manipulating the independent variable and measuring the dependent variable. The randomization of the students into two groups ensures that any other factors that may influence attention during the lecture are evenly distributed between the two groups.
