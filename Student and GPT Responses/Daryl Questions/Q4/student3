The independent variable I will test in my experiment is the amount of breakfast students have before the morning lectures. The students in the experimental group will have breakfast before the morning lecture, while the students in the control group wonâ€™t have breakfast. In order to measure the extent to which students pay attention in the morning classes, I will have them finish a small quiz in 30 minutes, containing 10 multiple choice questions about the lecture contents they have just learned, 1 point for each. The dependent variable will be the score they get in the memory test after the lecture. By recording and analyzing the scores students get, I can see how much content they memorized from the class, which can reflect their concentration level in class. For the score, 0 means that the student memorized few contents and has paid little attention in class, and 10 means that the student memorized most of the contents and maintained a high attention level through the whole lecture. Based on my independent variable and dependent variable, my hypothesis for the experiment would be that having breakfast prior to taking a morning lecture will help students memorize more lecture contents, compared with not having breakfast.
