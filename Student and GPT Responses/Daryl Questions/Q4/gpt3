To determine if eating breakfast helps students pay attention better in morning lectures, the professor can conduct an experiment by randomly assigning students to one of two groups: an experimental group and a control group.

Independent variable: The independent variable in this experiment is whether or not the students eat breakfast before the lecture. The students in the experimental group will eat breakfast before the lecture, while the students in the control group will not eat breakfast.

Dependent variable: The dependent variable in this experiment is the students' attention during the lecture. The professor will measure the students' attention by using a standardized attention test, such as the Digit Span task, which measures the ability to repeat a sequence of numbers in the correct order. The professor will administer the test before and after the lecture.

Operationalization: Eating breakfast before the lecture is operationalized as consuming at least 400 calories within one hour before the lecture. The students in the experimental group will be provided with a standardized breakfast of 400 calories, while the students in the control group will not eat any breakfast before the lecture.

Hypothesis: The hypothesis for this experiment is that students who eat breakfast before the lecture will have better attention during the lecture than students who do not eat breakfast.

This experimental design allows the professor to test the effect of eating breakfast on attention while controlling for other factors that may affect attention, such as sleep, stress, and time of day. The professor could also include additional measures to control for other factors such as sleep and stress, such as measuring the sleep quality and stress levels of the students before the lecture.
