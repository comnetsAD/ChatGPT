In our study, the independent variable is eating breakfast (some or none) and the dependent variable is level of attention or concentration. Having breakfast in this experiment is defined as anything consumed by the student from the time they wake up till the time they enter their morning lectures. So let’s say a grilled cheese sandwich is our operational definition for breakfast. Attention is defined as the ability of the student to concentrate for a set amount of time on a task, understanding class materials, with filtering out distractions including background noise, visual distractions, and their intrusive thoughts. Therefore, we can say that the operational definition for attention is doing well on an attention test such as the Toulouse-Piéron Cancelation Test, a test used to assess attention. The conditions for the independent  variable as noted above is some or none, so we’d have two groups: those who had breakfast and those who did not. A potential hypothesis could be that having a grilled cheese sandwich before a morning class will increase students’ scores on the Toulouse-Piéron Cancelation Test.
