In an experiment based on this theory, a suitable independent variable, which we can manipulate, would be whether a student had breakfast before coming to the morning class. Half the students should be given breakfast before coming to class and the other half should not eat breakfast.
The dependent variable, which we want to measure would be how much the students can pay attention to the class material. This can be operationalized by taking end-of-class quizzes on materials discussed that day and comparing the number of correctly answered questions between the two groups.
Based on our theory, a logical null-hypothesis would be that there is no relationship between whether a student had breakfast before a morning class and how much they could pay attention to the class, therefore there will be no difference in the number of questions answered correctly during the quizzes. Springing from this my alternative hypothesis is, that students who had breakfast before their morning classes were able to pay more attention to the class material, so they will have more correct answers on the end-of-class quizzes.
