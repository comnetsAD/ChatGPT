Experiment Design:
-Independent Variable: Eating breakfast
-Dependent Variable: Attention during morning lectures

Operationalization of variables:
-Independent Variable (Eating breakfast):
-Condition 1: Eating a typical breakfast (cereal, milk, and fruit)
-Condition 2: Not eating breakfast (abstinence)
-Dependent Variable (Attention during morning lectures):
-Attention will be measured by using a standardized attention test (e.g. Digit Span Test, Continuous Performance Test) before and after the morning lecture.
-Attention will also be measured by the number of times students are caught not paying attention during the lecture as reported by the instructor.

Hypothesis:
Eating breakfast will lead to better attention during morning lectures compared to not eating breakfast.

Procedure:
Participants: A sample of college students who attend morning lectures
Randomly assign students to either the breakfast or no breakfast condition.
Before the morning lecture, administer the attention test and record the results.
During the lecture, the instructor will record the number of times students are caught not paying attention.
After the lecture, administer the attention test again and record the results.
Compare the attention test scores and the number of times students were caught not paying attention between the two conditions.
This experimental design will help determine the effect of eating breakfast on attention during morning lectures by comparing the attention scores and the number of times students were caught not paying attention between the two conditions.
