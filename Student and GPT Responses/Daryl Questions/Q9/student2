According to CAT, a person may come to experience emotions based on their evaluation of a situation or event. When an individual encounters a situation or event, they engage in cognitive appraisal, where they consciously or unconsciously evaluate the situation or event. Based on this evaluation, the individual may come to experience different emotions. A situation appraised as detrimental that is also perceived as wilful, unjustified and avoidable, like somebody eating our food even when they know itâ€™s ours and we did not give our consent may prompt us to feel anger. Rather than the situation itself, our emotion, anger, comes from our appraisal of the event.
