Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT) proposes that emotions are the result of an individual's cognitive evaluation or appraisal of a particular situation. According to this theory, a person's emotional response to a particular situation is determined by the individual's cognitive appraisal of the situation, specifically in terms of the situation's relevance to their well-being and the resources they have available to cope with the situation.

In the case of anger, a person may experience this emotion when they perceive a situation as threatening or unjust, and they have the belief that they can do something to change it.

CAT proposes that there are two types of appraisals that can lead to the experience of anger. The first type is called primary appraisal, which involves the evaluation of a situation in terms of its relevance to the individual's well-being. For example, if a person perceives a situation as a threat or a challenge to their goals, this will activate the emotion of anger.

The second type of appraisal is called secondary appraisal, which involves the evaluation of the resources available to cope with the situation. If a person perceives that they have the ability to change or control the situation, this can lead to the experience of anger. However, if a person perceives that they have no control over the situation, this can lead to feelings of helplessness and frustration.

To illustrate, imagine that John is driving to work and he is cut off by another driver. He perceives the situation as a threat to his safety and his goal of arriving at work on time. This activates his primary appraisal of the situation. He then evaluates his coping resources, and he believes that he could honk his horn and signal the other driver to let him know that he is not happy with their behavior, this activates his secondary appraisal.

Overall, CAT proposes that the experience of anger is the result of a person's cognitive appraisal of a situation as relevant to their well-being, and as something that they have the ability to change or control. This can activate the emotion of anger as a response to the perceived threat or challenge.
