Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT) is a theory that explains how individuals come to experience different emotions based on their cognitive evaluations of a particular situation or event. According to CAT, emotions are the result of an individual's appraisals of the significance or personal relevance of a particular event or situation.

When it comes to anger, CAT proposes that this emotion is triggered by an individual's appraisal of a situation as being one in which their goals or needs are being thwarted or blocked in some way. A person may come to experience anger when they perceive a situation as unfair, unjust or as a threat to their personal well-being.

For example, imagine a person is driving on the highway and a car cuts them off, causing them to brake suddenly. If the person perceives the situation as a threat to their personal safety, they will likely experience anger. Their appraisal of the situation as a threat, activates the brain's threat response, releasing stress hormones and leading to feelings of anger.

Additionally, the person might also appraise the situation as an injustice, because the other driver's actions are selfish and not considerate of other drivers on the road. This appraisal of injustice activates a different neural network and leads to a sense of moral outrage, and reinforces the feeling of anger.

In summary, CAT proposes that anger is triggered by an individual's appraisal of a situation as being one in which their goals or needs are being thwarted or blocked in some way. The person's appraisal that the situation is a threat to their personal well-being, or an injustice activates the brain's threat response and leads to feelings of anger.
