According to CAT, we face a situation, we make sense out of it (cognitive appraisal), we experience an emotion, and then we have the behavior. In some situations when we experience an emotion we go back to cognitive appraisal and that might intensify our emotions and behavior. When you are driving, and someone keeps honking at you for being slow when you are not you would go through cognitive appraisal someone is honking at me for no reason this gets you angry. Your behavior would be to go slower and give them a reason to honk.
