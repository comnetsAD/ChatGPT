Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT) is a theory that explains how emotions are generated in response to the interpretation of an event or situation. According to CAT, people's emotional responses are based on their cognitive appraisal of the event or situation.

When it comes to experiencing anger, CAT suggests that a person may come to experience this emotion when they perceive a threat or injustice. The process begins with an individual perceiving an event or situation that they evaluate as a potential threat or injustice to their well-being or goals. They then make a cognitive appraisal of the event or situation, evaluating whether it is harmful or negative, and whether it is relevant to their goals or concerns.

If the individual perceives the event or situation as harmful or negative, and it is relevant to their goals or concerns, they will then experience the emotion of anger. The individual will then respond to the event or situation with an action tendency, such as aggression or assertiveness.

For example, if an individual is passed over for a promotion they believed they deserved, they may perceive this event as a threat to their career goals. They may then make a cognitive appraisal of the event, evaluating it as harmful and relevant to their goals. As a result, they will experience anger and may respond with assertiveness by speaking to their manager to express their dissatisfaction.

In summary, CAT suggests that a person may come to experience anger when they perceive a threat or injustice, make a cognitive appraisal of the event as harmful and relevant to their goals or concerns, and respond with an action tendency such as aggression or assertiveness.
