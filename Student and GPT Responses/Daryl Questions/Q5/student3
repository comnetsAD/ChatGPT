I think Sara may be suffering from a psychological disorder, and she may be suffering from General Anxiety Disorder (GAD). This is because Sara has frequently felt stressed and anxious about leaving the house to go shopping, to do exercise, or to see friends or family since about seven months ago to the extent that she has stopped all these social and physical activities, which not only meets the criterion A for GAD, “Excessive anxiety and worry, occurring more days than not for at least 6 months, about a number of events or activities,” but also meets the criterion D, “The anxiety, worry, or physical symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.” This is also because Sara has started to have trouble sleeping, feels irritable, feels on edge most of the time, and finds it difficult to concentrate when working from home, and these four symptoms appearing together meet the criterion C for GAD.
