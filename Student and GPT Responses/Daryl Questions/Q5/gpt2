Based on the conversation with Sara, it is possible that she is suffering from a psychological disorder. The symptoms she describes, such as intense anxiety, avoidance of social situations, difficulty sleeping, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and excessive worry about contamination, are consistent with the criteria for a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

OCD is a mental disorder characterized by persistent and recurring thoughts, feelings, ideas, sensations, or behaviors that are experienced as intrusive, unwanted and uncontrollable.

Three criteria that Sara may meet for a diagnosis of OCD are:
Obsessions: Sara described having intense and persistent worries about contamination and the fear of catching COVID-19 from fast food. These worries are consistent with the criteria for obsessions, which are defined as recurrent, persistent, and unwanted thoughts, impulses, or images that cause anxiety or distress.
Compulsions: Sara described avoiding going out to see friends or family, and avoiding going shopping or doing exercise. This avoidance behavior is consistent with the criteria for compulsions, which are defined as repetitive behaviors or mental acts that a person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly.
Impairment: Sara reported difficulty sleeping, irritability, and difficulty concentrating, which can also be seen as a form of impairment in social, occupational, or other important areas of functioning.

It is worth noting that, a professional evaluation by a mental health professional is needed to confirm a diagnosis of OCD, as well as to rule out other possibilities, such as generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, or major depressive disorder.
