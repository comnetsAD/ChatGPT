Based on the conversation with Sara, it is possible that she may be suffering from Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). The DSM-V criteria for GAD that we can examine in Saraâ€™s behaviour include excessive and persistent worry and anxiety about a range of different events or activities (pandemic, shopping or exercise) for more than six months, which is interfering with her daily functioning (she has stopped leaving the house for any occasion) and has symptoms like difficulty sleeping or concentrating, irritability and feeling on edge. As far as we know the effects cannot be attributed to substance abuse or to other medical conditions (hyperthyroidism) either. Because of the excessive worry over infectious diseases she also may experience Illness Anxiety Disorder.
