Based on the information provided, it is possible that Sara may be suffering from a psychological disorder. The symptoms she describes, such as excessive anxiety, avoidance of activities and places, difficulty sleeping, irritability, difficulty concentrating, and worry about infection, are consistent with the criteria for a diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD).

GAD is a disorder characterized by excessive and uncontrollable worry about a variety of events or activities. To meet the criteria for a diagnosis of GAD, an individual must exhibit at least 3 of the following symptoms:
Restlessness or feeling keyed up or on edge
Being easily fatigued
Difficulty concentrating or mind going blank
Irritability
Muscle tension
Sleep disturbance

In Sara's case, she describes feeling irritable, keyed up or on edge, having difficulty sleeping, and difficulty concentrating. Additionally, her avoidance of activities and places and worries about infection also fall under GAD criteria.

It is important to note that a diagnosis of GAD or any other disorder should be made by a licensed mental health professional after a thorough evaluation. Additionally, it is also worth noting that the COVID-19 pandemic has a huge impact on people's mental health, and it's understandable that Sara's symptoms may have been exacerbated by the pandemic.
