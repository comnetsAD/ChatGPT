Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT) posits that emotions are the result of an individual's evaluation or appraisal of a specific event or situation. According to CAT, an individual's emotional response is determined by two factors: their primary appraisal, which assesses whether a situation is relevant or insignificant, and their secondary appraisal, which evaluates whether they have the resources to cope with the situation.

In the first example, an individual may experience sudden anxiety and fear when they hear a gunshot nearby in a strange city at night. This is an example of a situation that would be considered high in threat, and thus, would trigger a primary appraisal of danger. Given that the situation is unexpected, the individual may also evaluate that they have limited resources to cope with the situation, leading to a secondary appraisal of helplessness. As a result, the individual may experience anxiety and fear.

In contrast, in the second example, an individual may experience anxiety and fear over an extended period of time when they are about to take a driving test. This is an example of a situation that would be considered high in relevance, but low in threat. The individual may evaluate that they have the resources to cope with the situation, but their performance is important to them and that there is a possibility of failure. This leads to a secondary appraisal of stress. Therefore, the individual may experience anxiety and fear over an extended period of time leading up to the test, as they anticipate and prepare for it.

In summary, the different ways of experiencing anxiety/fear in these two examples is due to the fact that cognitive appraisal theory suggests that emotional experiences are the result of an individual's evaluation or appraisal of a specific event or situation. In the first example, the individual's emotional response is triggered by a primary appraisal of danger and a secondary appraisal of helplessness, while in the second example, the individual's emotional response is triggered by a primary appraisal of relevance and a secondary appraisal of stress.
