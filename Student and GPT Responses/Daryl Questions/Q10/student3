There are these two different ways of experiencing anxiety/fear because our emotional responses can follow two different brain pathways: Some simple emotional responses (especially simple fears) take the speedy “low road” and involve no conscious appraisal. The individual thus automatically feels startled and anxious in the case of hearing a gunshot even before labeling the gunshot as a threat. On the other hand, some emotions (especially more complex feelings) travel a “high road.” A stimulus following this path would travel to the brain’s cortex; it would be analyzed and labeled there before the response command is sent out via the amygdala. These complex feelings are greatly affected by our conscious information processing. That’s why it takes an extended period of time for the individual to experience anxiety/fear when about to take a driving test.
