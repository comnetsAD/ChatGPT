Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT) explains that the experience of emotions is determined by the way an individual evaluates and interprets a situation. According to CAT, there are two types of appraisals that can lead to the experience of anxiety and fear: primary and secondary appraisals.

Primary appraisal refers to the initial evaluation of a situation in terms of its potential impact on an individual's well-being. In the case of suddenly hearing a gunshot nearby in a strange city at night, an individual's primary appraisal would likely be that the situation is dangerous and poses a threat to their safety. As a result, the individual may experience a sudden onset of anxiety and fear.

Secondary appraisal, on the other hand, refers to the evaluation of one's ability to cope with the situation. In the case of taking a driving test, an individual's secondary appraisal may be that they are not prepared or are inadequate in some way, that leads to fear of failure. This fear may be more prolonged and intense compared to the sudden fear experienced when hearing a gunshot.

In summary, the different ways of experiencing anxiety and fear are due to the way an individual appraises the situation. In the case of the gunshot, the primary appraisal is that the situation is dangerous and poses a threat, while in the case of the driving test, the secondary appraisal is that the individual may not be prepared or adequate enough to pass the test.
