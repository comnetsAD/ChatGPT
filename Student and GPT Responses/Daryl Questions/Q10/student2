When an individual experiences the sudden shock of the gunshot the information may travel through the “low-road” directly to the amygdala bypassing the cortex to create an instant emotional response (fear or stress) and prompt a reflex (fight-or-flight) and proper stress response, even before conscience. In the other case, we consciously appraise the test in our cortex to be beyond our capabilities and its uncertainty as a threat, so we may feel chronic fear or anxiety. This emotional reaction is slower but can be long-lasting and can also get the Additional Stress Response involved to prepare us for the “threat”.
