Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT) suggests that emotions are the result of an individual's interpretation or appraisal of a situation. In the case of the sudden experience of anxiety and fear upon hearing a gunshot nearby in a strange city at night, CAT would suggest that this emotional response is the result of an individual's appraisal of the situation as potentially dangerous. The individual's past experiences and current context, such as feeling vulnerable in an unfamiliar and potentially dangerous environment, would likely contribute to this appraisal.

In contrast, the experience of anxiety and fear over an extended period of time when an individual is about to take a driving test is the result of a different appraisal of the situation. In this case, the individual is likely to be appraising the situation as one in which there is a potential for negative evaluation or failure, which would be associated with an emotional response of anxiety and fear. The individual's past experiences with taking tests and their personal beliefs about their own driving abilities may contribute to this appraisal.

In summary, the two different ways of experiencing anxiety and fear are the result of different appraisals of the situation. The first is a sudden response to a perceived danger, and the second is an extended period of fear of negative evaluation or failure. The cognitive appraisal theory suggests that different emotions are the result of different interpretations or appraisals of a situation.
