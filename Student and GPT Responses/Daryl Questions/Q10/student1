When you are in a different city, alone, at night, and you hear gunshots the fear you experience according to Zajonc takes a neural short cut and goes straight to the amygdala. This emotional response involve no deliberate thinking and you go into fight or flight. However, when you are taking a driving test the anxiety you experience is more manageable and not life threatening. In this case, we have the exam then we have the appraisal which is we see it as a threat or something that we have to ace the emotion is then fear or anxiety. However, if we change our appraisal and think about it as an experience and if we fail, we can retake it then fear decreases and the emotion we end up with is excitement.
