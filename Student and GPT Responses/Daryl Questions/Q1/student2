Our need to belong, one of our fundamental psychological needs, refers to the desire to form and maintain social-connections with others, and to be accepted and valued by those around us, as it helps us to feel safe and supported, and can provide a sense of meaning and purpose in our lives. Social-media can feed this desire by putting you together with people who share the same values and opinions. However, it can create a group-polarization effect which can lead to radical ideas gaining momentum. It can also replace real-world human connections which may lead to reduced social-skills and isolation.
