We are social creatures who are motivated by strong need to belong, which is the need to build and maintain relationships and to feel part of a group. We are happy when we are in close meaningful relationships while social isolation can put us at risk for mental decline, ill health, and suicidal thinking. However, social media may be problematic in feeding peopleâ€™s need to belong since it leads people to compare their lives with others and triggers envy, anxiety, and depressed feelings, especially when seeing others being happier, more popular, or more successful. Besides, social media also rewards self-glamorizing photo posting and promotes narcissism.
