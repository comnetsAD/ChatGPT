According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the need to belong is a fundamental human need that includes the desire for social interaction, love, and a sense of connection with others. It is one of the basic human needs which must be fulfilled in order for an individual to feel fulfilled and satisfied in life.

However, social media can be problematic in feeding people's need to belong because it can create a false sense of connection and belonging. Social media allows people to present an idealized version of themselves, and people can be misled by this false persona. Social media can also create feelings of isolation, as people may feel that they are not living up to the ideals presented by others on social media. Additionally, social media can foster feelings of envy and inadequacy, as people may compare their own lives to the highlight reels of other people's lives.
