We're social beings who have thrived because we work in teams and rely on each other. By constructing a tight circle around ourselves, we support those inside and feel threatened by those outside that group or social circle. We're happy when others remember us and when we have tightly knit, meaningful relationships. Internet socializing is problematic because we seek false interaction with others, compare ourselves to others, and experience anxiety and depression.
