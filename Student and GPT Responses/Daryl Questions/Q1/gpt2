The "need to belong" is a concept proposed by Abraham Maslow in his hierarchy of needs. It refers to the human need to form and maintain close relationships with others, such as family, friends, and romantic partners. This need is considered to be a fundamental human motivation, and is believed to be necessary for emotional well-being.

Social media can be problematic in feeding people's need to belong in a number of ways. One issue is that social media use can lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation. Studies have shown that people who spend more time on social media tend to report higher levels of loneliness and depression. Additionally, social media can contribute to feelings of social comparison and inadequacy, as people are often presented with carefully curated and filtered versions of their peers' lives. Finally, social media can lead to the creation of "echo chambers", where people only interact with people who share their views, and may not be exposed to a diverse range of perspectives.
