The need to belong refers to the psychological drive to form and maintain social connections with others. According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the need to belong is considered a fundamental human need, along with physiological needs, safety, esteem, and self-actualization.

Social media can be problematic in feeding people's need to belong because it can create a false sense of connection. People may have many "friends" and followers on social media, but these connections may not be meaningful or genuine. Additionally, social media can also perpetuate feelings of isolation and loneliness by highlighting the social connections and experiences of others, leading to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem. Social comparison on social media is also one of the main factor that can lead to mental health issue.
