The behaviourist perspective by Skinner emphasized nurture and proposed that language development occurs through a process of reinforcement, where children learn to make specific sounds and use words by being rewarded for doing so. This means that language acquisition is solely facilitated by learning, through observation, modelling, and rewards. While these aspects influence language acquisition, many thought that the pace of it suggests that there is an underlying predisposition in us for languages. Here comes Chomskyâ€™s theory about the universal grammar which highlights the role of nature in language development. He suggests that all speakers have an innate predisposition to learn the grammatical rules of any human language. It provides the foundation for an individual's ability to learn and use language. It is not a specific set of rules or grammar structures, but rather a set of principles and constraints that guide the development of a person's language abilities. So, both nature and nurture appear to influence language acquisition, with nature providing the underlying ability to learn the language quickly and nurture providing the specific language experiences and reinforcement that help to shape the language a child ultimately acquires.
