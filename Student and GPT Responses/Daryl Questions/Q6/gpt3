Language development is a complex process that is influenced by both nature and nurture. The nature aspect refers to the innate, biological factors that contribute to language development, such as the presence of specific brain structures and neural connections that are necessary for language processing. The nurture aspect refers to the environmental factors that contribute to language development, such as exposure to language, language input, and social interactions.

Two theories that discuss the role of nature and nurture in language development are the Nativist theory and the Behavioral theory.

Nativist theory, proposed by Noam Chomsky, argues that humans have an innate capacity for language, which is based on a language-specific module in the brain. According to Chomsky, this innate capacity allows children to acquire language quickly and easily, regardless of the specific language they are exposed to. Nativist theory emphasizes the role of nature in language development, arguing that children are born with the ability to acquire language, and that this ability is not dependent on environmental factors.

Behavioral theory, proposed by B.F. Skinner, argues that language is learned through conditioning and reinforcement. According to Skinner, children learn language by imitating the speech of adults around them and by receiving positive reinforcement for producing language that is similar to adult speech. Behavioral theory emphasizes the role of nurture in language development, arguing that children learn language through exposure to language and social interactions.

In conclusion, language development is influenced by both nature and nurture. Nativist theory emphasizes the role of nature, arguing that children are born with an innate capacity for language, while Behavioral theory emphasizes the role of nurture, arguing that children learn language through exposure to language and social interactions. It's important to note that both theories have their own strengths and weaknesses and it's likely that the process of language development is influenced by a combination of both nature and nurture.
