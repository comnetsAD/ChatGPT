The nature vs. nurture debate in language development is a longstanding one, and it is generally accepted that both nature and nurture play a role in the development of language.

One theory that supports the role of nature in language development is the Nativism theory, which posits that the capacity to acquire language is innate and that humans are born with an innate language acquisition device (LAD) that allows them to acquire language. Nativists argue that the ability to acquire language is not something that is learned, but rather it is something that is innate and hardwired into the human brain.

Another theory that supports the role of nurture in language development is the Social Interactionist theory, which posits that the environment plays a crucial role in the development of language. Social interactionists argue that language development is not just about innate abilities, but also about the social interactions that children have with their caregivers and the linguistic input they receive. They believe that the quality and quantity of linguistic input that children receive, as well as the social interactions they have, are crucial for the development of language.

Therefore, it can be argued that both nature and nurture play a role in language development. On one hand, the innate capacity to acquire language plays a role in allowing individuals to learn a language, but on the other hand, the quality and quantity of linguistic input that individuals receive and the social interactions they have are crucial for the development of language.

In summary, while it is true that all typically developing individuals have the capacity to acquire and use language, this does not mean that language development is all nature and no nurture. Both nature and nurture play a role in language development, with nativism emphasizing the role of nature and social interactionism emphasizing the role of nurture.
