Language development is both about learning (nurture) and biological predispositions (nature) combined: Nature gives us hardware and operating systems while the exposure to language in a social context gives us our software. In class, we’ve seen that Skinner’s theory that language is acquired through the learning process is not true as children acquire language faster than they can learn it. Chomsky maintains that people are born with a built-in universal grammar that allows us to quickly acquire language automatically without learning it but there is also a critical period within which language learning must take place, which is supported by plenty of evidence including the fact that most errors made by young children mostly come from overgeneralization of grammar rules rather than mislearning and that children raised in extreme isolation probably never develop a language. Also, Universal Grammar and Critical Period can be easily reconciled but Critical Period and Skinner’s associationistic learning can hardly be reconciled, which makes Chomsky’s theory even more valid and Skinner’s theory less true.
