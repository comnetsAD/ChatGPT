Humans possess a biological mechanism within their minds that allows them to acquire and utilize language. We are able to communicate with one another using our own languages.  Languages are acquired by exposure, repetition, and instruction from those around. This would be an example of nurture. Ultimately, our ability to communicate with one another is influenced more by nature than it is by nurture. Two examples of that discussed in class are that infants being able to distinguish between different sounds before the age of one and the concept of universal grammar. According to Chomsky, language is a natural human characteristic that is distinct from other aspects of cognition. He proposed that preschoolers' ease in picking up language and their mastery of grammar is due in part to a tendency to acquire grammar rules quickly and with ease. Language is a combination of both nature and nurture and it is not purely one or the other. However, it is mostly nature in my opinion.
