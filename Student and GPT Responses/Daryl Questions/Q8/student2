Bees (but only forager-bees) can employ a dance move system to signal the location of food to other bees in the hive. This system can convey information about the distance, direction, and quality of the food supply (by changing elements of the dance like the style, orientation, and intensity of the dance) so it also has systematic rules and some reduced syntax. However, it cannot express abstract notions or generate new word combinations to produce innovative meanings. Another example is the vocalizations of male songbirds, which may produce various sounds. While they can arrange and rearrange sounds as repeated units it will not change the logical meaning of the combinations for them. They cannot construct complex sentences with various meanings. So the variety of signs or systematic, syntax-based communication is not unequalled in nature, but the level of intricacy (infinite means of self-expression by combining our finite words into infinite understandable sentences) of our language and its universality (every typically developing human can use it without the need of an explicit outside instruction) is unmatched.
