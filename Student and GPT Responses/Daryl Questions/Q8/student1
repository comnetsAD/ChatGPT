What we can learn from studying other animals is that each animal species has their own unique method of communication, and that language is not equal to communication by definition but is used to communicate ideas and thoughts. Language is only 1 form of communication that is specific to humans. Singing is for male songbirds as dancing is for forager bees. Language allows us to combine words to form new ideas while bees canâ€™t do that with their dances nor can song birds with their songs. What makes a language different with respect to other forms of communication is the use of finite or limited words to describe infinite meanings.
