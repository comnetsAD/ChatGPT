Studying the communication systems of other animals can provide insights into the evolution and development of human language. Research on bees and parrots, for example, has highlighted similarities and differences between their communication systems and human language.

One aspect that human language shares with the communication systems of other animals is the use of symbols or signs to represent objects or concepts. For example, bees use a dance language to communicate the location of food sources to other bees. The dance, which consists of specific movements and orientations, serves as a symbol or sign for the location of food. Similarly, parrots use a variety of vocalizations and gestures to communicate with other parrots, and some researchers have argued that these vocalizations and gestures can also be seen as symbols or signs.

Another aspect that human language shares with the communication systems of other animals is the use of combinatorial rules, which allow for the combination of different elements to create new meanings. For example, bees use a combination of different dance movements and orientations to convey information about the distance and direction of food sources. Similarly, human language uses a combination of different sounds or letters to create words and sentences.

However, there are also several key differences between the communication systems of other animals and human language. One of the most notable differences is that human language is a symbolic system that is based on arbitrary relationships between signs and meanings, whereas the communication systems of other animals are based on innate or learned associations between specific signs and specific meanings. Another difference is that human language is a generative system that allows for the creation of an infinite number of new combinations and expressions, whereas the communication systems of other animals are limited in the number of combinations they can create.

In summary, studying the communication systems of other animals can provide insights into the evolution and development of human language. There are similarities between human language and the communication systems of other animals, such as the use of symbols and combinatorial rules. However, there are also notable differences, such as human language's arbitrary relationship between signs and meanings and it's generative nature.
