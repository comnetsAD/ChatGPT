From studying other animals, we can learn that although some animals like pigeons display basic language processing and other animals like chimpanzees show impressive comprehension and communication, human language is a species-specific trait. Human language and those of other animals share the ability to exchange information and the use of sound in many cases. But human language is unique in its ability to combine a finite set of words into an infinite number of utterances compared with animals’ inability to recombine elements to express new ideas. Besides, while only forager bees “dance” and only male songbirds “sing”, all humans learn to speak and comprehend without explicit instruction. What’s more, only humans have a version of gene that helps enable the lip, tongue, and vocal cord movements of human speech.
