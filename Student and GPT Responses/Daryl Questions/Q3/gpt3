Perception is the process by which the brain interprets and makes sense of sensory information. The faculty's design of glasses that fools the brain into thinking objects are farther away than they are without changing how they appear on the retina, is likely to affect depth perception.

When wearing these glasses, the brain will interpret objects as farther away than they actually are. This change in perception is likely to affect the way that the brain processes the size, location, and distance of objects. For example, when looking at a nearby object, it may appear smaller and farther away. Similarly, when looking at a distant object, it may appear larger and closer.

Additionally, the glasses may affect how the brain processes relative motion and motion parallax. Motion parallax is the change in the relative position of objects in a scene as the observer's point of view changes. When the glasses make nearby objects appear farther away, it would reduce the amount of relative motion and change the perceived speed of objects in the scene.

Furthermore, the glasses may affect how the brain processes the relative size and location of objects in a scene. The brain uses the size and location of objects to determine the relative distance between objects. However, when the glasses make nearby objects appear farther away, it would cause a mismatch between the size and location of objects and their perceived distance, which could lead to confusion and disorientation.

Overall, the glasses are likely to disrupt the normal processing of sensory information by the brain, leading to a change in perception of the distance, size and location of objects.
