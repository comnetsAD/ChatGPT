In this case, although the image that appears on the retina doesn’t change, our perception of the stimuli is changed. When wearing the glasses, as our brains are fooled into thinking that the objects are farther away than they are, our brains will readjust to make the objects look larger. A similar condition discussed in the lecture is the moon illusion. The moon usually seems larger when it’s at the horizon rather than high up in the sky. That’s not because the moon at the horizon is actually closer to us. Instead, they are the same image in our retina. However, the cues make the moon seem further away when it is at the horizon, so our brains readjust to make the moon look larger.
