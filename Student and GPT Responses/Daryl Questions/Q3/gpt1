The perception of an object is determined by the size of the image that is projected onto the retina, as well as the distance of the object from the observer. The glasses that you have described change the distance of an object without changing the size of the image on the retina. This would cause the brain to perceive the object as being farther away than it actually is.

One way this could change perception while wearing the glasses is that the glasses would cause objects to appear smaller. This is because as the distance between an object and the observer increases, the size of the object on the retina decreases. In this case, the glasses would make objects appear smaller even though they are physically the same size.

Another way this could change perception while wearing the glasses is that the glasses would change the perceived depth of an image. Objects that are farther away would appear closer and objects that are closer would appear farther away. This could cause confusion and disorientation for the observer.

It could also cause changes in the way the brain processes and interprets the visual information, making it difficult to judge distances, and making it harder to perform activities that require depth perception such as driving or playing sports.

It's worth noting that these glasses might also have an impact on other cognitive processes like memory and spatial awareness, since the brain uses the information of the distance of objects in order to remember and recall information about the environment.
