To estimate the distance of close objects, we make use of binocular cues. Convergence, or the inward angle of the eyes when they are focused on a close object, is one such cue. Retinal disparity is still another. Our eyes are separated by space, so each retina receives a slightly distinct view of the outside world. Our brain can determine how close an object is to you by comparing these two images. The closer the item, the larger the difference between the two retinal pictures. We need monocular cues, cues for each eye individually, in order to determine the distances between things and how far apart they are. The size of an object provides information about its distance. An example of this is the moon illusion. Near the horizon, the Moon appears larger than when it is high in the sky. Monocular distance cues make the horizon Moon appear more distant. Our brain expects that if something is farther distant, it must be larger than the Moon in the night sky. One reason is that monocular distance cues make the horizon Moon appear more distant. That being said with those glasses we will have an issue in perceiving object depth as well as objectsâ€™ sizes.
