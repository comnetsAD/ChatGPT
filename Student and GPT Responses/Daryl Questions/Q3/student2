In this case, similarly to Moon illusion, while the retinal image of the objects does not change, based on the increase in their perceived distance they will appear to be larger. This can be deduced from the phenomenon of perceptual constancy, which refers to the fact that our perception of the colour, brightness, shape, and size of objects tends to be unchanging, even as the actual retinal image is changing. This illusion is just the opposite of this. When the context of objects changes (their perceived distance here) our perception of their size will change with it based on our expectations when there is no change in the retinal image. In other words, when two objects have the same retinal size, the object that seems to be further away will be perceived as bigger.
