If an NYUAD faculty has designed a special pair of glasses that fools the brain into thinking objects are farther away than they are, without changing how those objects appear on the retina, perception would change in several ways.

Firstly, the glasses would likely change the way people perceive size and distance, as the brain's perception of size and distance is closely linked to the perceived distance of objects. The brain uses the size of an object and its distance from the observer to perceive its size. So, if the glasses make objects appear farther away, the brain would perceive the objects as smaller.

Secondly, the glasses would likely change the way people perceive depth and 3D, as the brain uses the relative sizes and positions of objects in the visual field to perceive depth and 3D. If the glasses make objects appear farther away, the brain would perceive less depth and less 3D in the visual field.

Thirdly, the glasses would likely change the way people perceive movement and motion, as the brain uses the relative speeds and positions of objects in the visual field to perceive movement and motion. If the glasses make objects appear farther away, the brain would perceive less movement and less motion in the visual field.

Lastly, the glasses might change the way people perceive the relative importance of the objects in the visual field. The brain uses the perceived distance of objects to determine their relative importance. So, if the glasses make objects appear farther away, the brain would perceive less importance to them.

It's worth noting that this is a hypothetical scenario and it's not clear if such glasses exist or if such glasses would have the same effects on perception.
