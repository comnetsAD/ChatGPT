Behavioural addiction can be product of operant conditioning, in which an elective behaviour can be reinforced or diminished by consequential reward or punishment. For addiction, reinforcement is more relevant. It can be continuous; in which case, the desired behaviour is reinforced (followed by a reward) immediately every time it happens. This enables rapid learning, but quick extinction as well. Partial-reinforcement is more complex. It generally causes slower acquisition and extinction. The two variables that change are interval (reward is delayed after response) and ratio (reward comes after a certain number of responses). Both factors are either fixed/variable, meaning either the delay/the number of responses required is fixed or variable. Fixed-ratio schedule facilitates relatively fast acquisition but is not as addictive as a variable-ratio schedule, which is established more slowly, but its extinction is much harder due to unpredictable rewards. Mobile games, like Candy Crush, benefit from the thrill provided by unpredictable rewards since you may never know in which trial you may level up or receive a bonus. Fixed-interval produces a pattern where responses are only frequent around the expected time and therefore are slower and more controlled. Variable-interval schedule shows a more even growth in response, which is also somewhat even slower, than its fixed pair. It also benefits from unpredictability of reinforcement, making it highly addictive. Social media, like Facebook, works in a similar manner where we are conditioned to constantly check our phones so that we can see notifications that may come from our friends at any time.
