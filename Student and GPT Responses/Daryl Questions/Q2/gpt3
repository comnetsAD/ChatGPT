Reward schedules refer to the timing and frequency of rewards that are associated with a particular behavior. Different reward schedules can have a significant impact on behavior and the likelihood of addiction. The three most common reward schedules are:
Continuous schedule: This type of reward schedule provides rewards for every instance of a behavior. An example of this would be a slot machine, where a player is rewarded every time they pull the lever. This type of reward schedule is likely to be the most addictive, as the rewards are immediate and frequent.
Intermittent schedule: This type of reward schedule provides rewards at unpredictable intervals. An example of this would be a casino, where a player may win a jackpot on their first spin, or after several spins. This type of reward schedule can be addictive because the rewards are unpredictable and the anticipation of a reward can be highly motivating.
Ratio schedule: This type of reward schedule provides rewards based on a specific ratio of behavior. An example of this would be a loyalty program where customers receive a reward after a certain number of purchases. This type of reward schedule can be less addictive than the other two because the rewards are less frequent.

Two real-world examples of businesses that capitalize on these reward schedules are:
Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram use a continuous schedule of rewards, by providing likes and comments on every post, which can create an addiction to checking and posting on the platform.
Online gambling websites like PokerStars, Bet365 use an intermittent schedule of rewards, by providing large jackpots at unpredictable intervals, which creates an addiction to playing and anticipation of winning big.
