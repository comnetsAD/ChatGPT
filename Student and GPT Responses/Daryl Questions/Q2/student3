The four reward schedules are fixed-ratio, variable-ratio, fixed-interval, and variable-interval. In the fixed-ratio reward schedule, behaviors are reinforced by receiving rewards after a specific number of responses. The faster one responds, the more reward one will get. Therefore, it has the highest rate of responding, thus being the most addictive. Customer loyalty cards can be one example. Sometimes, customers get a loyalty card from the store, where they can get one point for each purchase. Once they’ve collected certain points, they can get a free product or coupons. The loyalty card incentivizes customers to come back and keep purchasing from a certain brand instead of its competitors. In the variable-ratio reward schedule, behaviors are reinforced by receiving rewards after an unpredictable number of responses. It has a relatively high rate of responding and the behaviors reinforced are hard to extinguish because of the unpredictability. The slot machine is an example. Not every time people play the slot machine can they get a reward. After some operations, in an unpredictable time, the player may win, which can reinforce people’s behavior of continuing to play the machine. In the fixed-interval reward schedule, responses are reinforced after a specific time has passed. In the variable-interval reward schedule, responses are reinforced after an unpredictable period of time.
