Behavioral addiction refers to the excessive engagement in a particular behavior despite the negative consequences. Different reward schedules, or patterns of reinforcement, can impact behavior and influence the level of addiction.

The three main types of reward schedules are:
Continuous reinforcement, which provides a reward every time the behavior is exhibited. This schedule is not considered to be particularly addictive because it does not create the anticipation and excitement associated with intermittent reinforcement.
Fixed interval reinforcement, which provides a reward at set intervals of time, regardless of the number of behaviors exhibited. This schedule is considered to be less addictive than variable interval reinforcement because it does not create the anticipation and excitement associated with intermittent reinforcement.
Variable interval reinforcement, which provides a reward at random intervals of time, regardless of the number of behaviors exhibited. This schedule is considered to be the most addictive, as it creates anticipation and excitement, making it more difficult for the individual to stop the behavior.

Real-world examples:
Many social media platforms use variable interval reinforcement to keep customers coming back. For instance, notifications, likes, comments, and new followers come at a random interval, which creates anticipation and excitement.
Gambling machines use variable interval reinforcement to keep customers coming back. Slot machines are designed to pay out at random intervals, regardless of how much money has been spent. This creates anticipation and excitement, making it more difficult for the individual to stop playing.
In general, variable interval reinforcement is considered to be the most addictive because it creates anticipation and excitement, making it more difficult for the individual to stop the behavior. Social media and Gambling are examples of how businesses or products capitalize on this type of reward schedule to keep customers coming back.
