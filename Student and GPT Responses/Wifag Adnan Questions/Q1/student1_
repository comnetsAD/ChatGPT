False. For example, if a demand curve is given by P=10-2Q, the elasticity between the two points (2,6) and (3,4) is different from the elasticity between the two points (3,4) and (4,2). The elasticity between the first two points is = ((2-3)/((2+3)/2))/((6-4)/((6+4)/2)) and the elasticity of the last two points is ((3-4)/((3+4)/2))/((4-2)/((2+4)/2)) = 0.43. As we can see, for the same linear demand curve, the elasticity of price is different. Therefore, the statement is false.
