False. The slope of a linear demand curve is constant, but the elasticity of a curve varies depending on the price, as it is the ratio of percentage change in quantity demanded to percentage change in price. A linear demand curve will have different elasticity at different prices because the percentage change in quantity demanded will not be the same at all prices, even though the slope is constant.
