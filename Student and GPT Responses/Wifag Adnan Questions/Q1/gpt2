False. A linear demand curve may have a constant slope, but it does not necessarily have the same elasticity at any price. Elasticity of demand is the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage change in price, and it can vary depending on the price level. Therefore, the elasticity of a linear demand curve will also vary depending on the price level.
