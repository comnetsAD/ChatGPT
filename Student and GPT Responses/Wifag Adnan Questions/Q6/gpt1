Since the movie theater can price discriminate between students and professors, it will charge the students $5 per ticket and charge the professors $10 per ticket. This way, the theater is able to capture the entire willingness to pay of both groups.

The students' willingness to pay is $5, so the theater will sell 900 tickets to students at a price of $5 each. The professors' willingness to pay is $10, so the theater will sell 100 tickets to professors at a price of $10 each.

The movie theater's profit can be calculated by subtracting the marginal cost from the revenue. The marginal cost per ticket is $3 and the movie theater will sell 900 tickets at $5 each and 100 tickets at $10 each, so the profit will be (900)($5 - $3) + (100)($10 - $3) = $3500

Consumer surplus is the difference between the maximum amount a consumer is willing to pay for a good and the actual price they pay. For the students, the consumer surplus is (900)($5 - $5) = $0, and for the professors, the consumer surplus is (100)($10 - $10) = $0.

Therefore, the movie theater will sell 900 tickets to students at $5 each, 100 tickets to professors at $10 each, make a profit of $3500 and the consumer surplus for both groups is $0.
