The movie theater can price discriminate between students and professors by charging different prices for movie tickets based on their willingness to pay. The theater can charge $5 for a movie ticket to students and $10 for a movie ticket to professors.

At the price of $5, all 900 students will buy a movie ticket because the price is equal to or less than their willingness to pay. At the price of $10, only 100 professors will buy a movie ticket because the price is equal to or less than their willingness to pay.

In total, the movie theater will sell 900 movie tickets to students and 100 movie tickets to professors for a total of 1000 tickets sold.

The movie theater's profit can be calculated by subtracting the marginal cost of $3 per ticket from the total revenue of $5 per student ticket and $10 per professor ticket. The profit will be: ($5 x 900) + ($10 x 100) - ($3 x 1000) = $4500.

The consumer surplus can be calculated by subtracting the price paid by the consumer from their willingness to pay. The consumer surplus for students will be: ($5 x 900) - ($5 x 900) = $0. The consumer surplus for professors will be: ($10 x 100) - ($10 x 100) = $0.

The movie theater is using price discrimination as a strategy to maximize its profit by charging different prices for the same product. The theater is selling all the tickets because the prices are equal or less than the willingness to pay of both students and professors. However, there is no consumer surplus for either students or professors, since they are paying the same as their willingness to pay.
