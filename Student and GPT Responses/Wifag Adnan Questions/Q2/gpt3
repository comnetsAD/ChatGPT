The statement is based on the assumption that the marginal utility associated with each good is constant, but in reality, it is likely that the marginal utility of a good will decrease as more of it is consumed. Thus, the statement that the consumption bundle consisting of 10 economics books and 50 cups of coffee per week maximizes the professor's utility and is his optimal consumption bundle might not be true.
