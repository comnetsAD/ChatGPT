False. The statement is false because it only considers the marginal utility of each good and not the total utility and budget constraint of the professor. The optimal consumption bundle can only be determined by considering the budget constraint and the marginal utility of the goods while also taking into account the law of diminishing marginal utility which states that as more units of a good are consumed, the marginal utility of that good will decrease.
