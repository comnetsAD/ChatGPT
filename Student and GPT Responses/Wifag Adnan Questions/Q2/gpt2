False. The fact that the marginal utility associated with each good is such that MU(E) = 75 and MU(C) = 3 at the consumption bundle of 10 economics books and 50 cups of coffee per week does not imply that this bundle maximizes the professor's utility and is his optimal consumption bundle. The marginal utility alone is not enough to determine the optimal bundle, one also needs to take into account the budget constraint and the consumer's preferences.
