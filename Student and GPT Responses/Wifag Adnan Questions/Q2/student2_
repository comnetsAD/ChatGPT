False. First of all, the bundle only adds up to $600 [$50X10+2X$50=$600], which shows the professor can buy more of either product to increase his utility and optimal consumption. Although (MU(E))/(P(E))= (MU(C))/(P(C))= 1.5, there must be another ideal bundle that optimizes his output using all $700.
