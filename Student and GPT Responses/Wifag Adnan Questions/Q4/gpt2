A price ceiling is a government-imposed price control that sets a legal maximum price for a good or service.

When a price ceiling is set at $2, the quantity demanded will be greater than the quantity supplied at that price.

Demand: QD = 10 - 2P
Supply: QS = 2P

The price ceiling of $2 results in a price of $2. Plugging this price into the demand equation, we can find the quantity demanded:
QD = 10 - 2P = 10 - 2(2) = 6

Plugging the price of $2 into the supply equation, we can find the quantity supplied:
QS = 2P = 2(2) = 4

The consumer surplus is the difference between the maximum amount consumers are willing to pay for a good or service and the price they actually pay.
At the price of $2, consumers are willing to pay $8 for the good and service, and so the consumer surplus is (8-2) * (6-4) = 24

The deadweight loss is the difference between the total surplus that would be generated by the market and the total surplus after the price ceiling. The deadweight loss is the loss of consumer surplus and producer surplus, and can be calculated as the area of the triangle between the market price, the price ceiling and the quantity supplied.

The deadweight loss is (1/2) * (6-4) * (2-2) = 0

In summary, the consumer surplus is 24 and the deadweight loss is 0.
