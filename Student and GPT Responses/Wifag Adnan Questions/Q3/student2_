3.) Accounting profit for running the bike store: 

Revenue $200,000
COGS       -100,000
Utilities    -  20,000
              AP= $80,000
Economic Profit for running the bike store:
AP      $80,000
Salary     -$40,000
Rent         -$50,000
              EP= -$10,000
As the economic profit for running the bike store is in the negatives, I should not continue to operate the bike store as I am better off working as an accountant, all things considered.
