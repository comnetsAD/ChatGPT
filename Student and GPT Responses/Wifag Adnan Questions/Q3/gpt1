The decision of whether to continue operating the bike store or to become an accountant and rent the store to the clothing retail chain depends on the relative profitability of the two options.

To evaluate the profitability of the bike store, we can calculate the net profit, which is the revenue minus the costs. The net profit of the bike store is 200,000 - 100,000 - 20,000 = $80,000 per year.

If you become an accountant, your salary is $40,000 per year and you don't need to pay the expenses of the store.

If you rent the store to the clothing retail chain, you would receive $50,000 per year in rent, which is more than the net profit of the bike store.

Therefore, if you want to maximize your revenue, it would be more profitable to rent the store to the retail chain, as it would give you a revenue of $50,000 per year.

In general, it's important to evaluate all the options and costs and revenue to make a good decision.
