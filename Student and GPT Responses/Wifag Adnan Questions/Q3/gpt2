To determine if you should continue to operate the bike store, you should compare the expected profits from running the bike store to the expected salary of an accountant and the rental income from renting the store.

The expected profits from running the bike store are:
Revenue - Costs = $200,000 - $100,000 - $20,000 = $80,000 per year

The expected salary of an accountant is $40,000 per year.

The expected rental income from renting the store is $50,000 per year.

Based on this information, it appears that operating the bike store would be more profitable than becoming an accountant or renting the store. The expected profit of $80,000 per year from running the bike store is higher than the expected salary of an accountant or the rental income. Therefore, it would be more beneficial for you to continue to operate the bike store.
