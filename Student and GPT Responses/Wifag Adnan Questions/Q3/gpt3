To determine whether you should continue to operate the bike store, you should compare the profits you would earn from the bike store to the profits you would earn if you became an accountant and rented out the store.

From the bike store, you earn a revenue of $200,000 per year and have costs of $100,000 for the bikes and $20,000 for electricity, taxes, and other expenses, for a total profit of $80,000 per year.

If you became an accountant and rented out the store, you would earn a salary of $40,000 per year and receive rental income of $50,000 per year, for a total profit of $90,000 per year.

Therefore, you should rent out the store and become an accountant, as it would lead to a higher profit of $90,000 per year compared to $80,000 per year from operating the bike store.
