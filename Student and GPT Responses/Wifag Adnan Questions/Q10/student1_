I do not expect it to last because the hairdresser is making a profit, it will attract new entrants to enter the market, more new entrants entering the market will shift the hairdresser’s demand curve to the left and decrease the price. It will cease to shift to the left when profit maximizing price=ATC and the hairdresser makes zero economic profit. Therefore, the hairdresser’s profit will not last long. In a perfectly competitive industry, when the individual firm is making a profit, it will attract new firms into the market, more new firms entering the market will shift the market supply curve to the right, then the output will increase and the price will decrease, the price will stop decrease till the price=ATC and the firms will make zero economic profit. Therefore, for the perfectly competitive industry, new entrants will make the market supply curve to the right and thus decrease the price but for the monopolistic competition, new entrants attracted by the profit will shift the individual’s demand curve to the left and thus, decrease the price.
