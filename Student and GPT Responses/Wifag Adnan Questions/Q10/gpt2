In a monopolistically competitive market, there are many firms that offer similar but differentiated products, and there are no significant barriers to entry. Under these market conditions, firms have some degree of market power, but it is not as strong as in a monopoly. This means that firms can earn positive economic profits in the short run but not in the long run. In the short run, firms can charge a higher price for their differentiated product, but in the long run, new firms will enter the market, and the existing firms will face increased competition, which will drive down prices and reduce profits.

Therefore, it is unlikely that your hairdresser's profit will last for five years or more. As new firms enter the market, the competition will increase, and the profit margin will decrease. Additionally, new firms will also start to copy your hairdresser's business model and offer similar services, which will also decrease your hairdresser's market power.

If the hairdressing industry was strongly competitive, your hairdresser would have to operate at the minimum average total cost and charge the market price, thus earning zero economic profit in the long run. The hairdresser's situation would be different, as the market would be much more price-sensitive, and the hairdresser would have to focus on keeping costs low and providing good service to attract and retain customers. The hairdresser would not be able to charge higher prices for differentiated services, and would not be able to retire in five years.
