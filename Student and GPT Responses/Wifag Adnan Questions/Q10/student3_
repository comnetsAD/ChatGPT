No. Demand will keep shifting to the left until it is tangent to ATC curve. Qd will eventually be tangent to ATC meaning zero economic profit in long-run. It will shift left since he is making a profit. More firms will enter, making him have less consumers. In competitive industry, it is at min ATC which is different from D tangent to ATC. Both will have zero economic profit in the long run.
