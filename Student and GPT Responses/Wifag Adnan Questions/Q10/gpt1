It is unlikely that a hairdresser in a monopolistically competitive market will be able to maintain a profit and retire in five years. Monopolistic competition is a market structure characterized by many firms offering slightly differentiated products, which means that there is a significant level of competition among firms. The hairdresser will face pressure from other hairdressers in the market who are also offering similar services and may be willing to lower their prices to attract customers.

In this market structure, there is a tendency for firms to earn only normal profits in the long run. The normal profit is the minimum amount of profit required to keep a firm in business, and it includes only the opportunity cost of the resources invested in the firm. Therefore, even if the hairdresser is making a profit, it may not be enough for them to retire in five years, as the profit may be just enough to cover the opportunity cost of the resources invested in the business, and not enough to allow the hairdresser to retire.

If the hairdressing industry was strongly competitive, the situation would be different. In a perfectly competitive market, firms are price takers and have no control over the market price. They can only earn normal profits in the long run, and they can't differentiate their product from others. Therefore, it would be even harder for a hairdresser in a perfectly competitive market to maintain a profit and retire in five years, as they would have to charge prices that are the same as their competitors and have no way of earning a higher profit by charging more.
