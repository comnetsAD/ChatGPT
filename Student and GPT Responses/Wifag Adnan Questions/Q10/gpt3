In a monopolistically competitive market, firms are able to earn economic profits in the short run, but not in the long run. The reason is that in the long run, new firms are able to enter the market, attracted by the high profits of existing firms, which causes an increase in the supply of hairdressing services and a decrease in the market price. As a result, the existing firms' profits decrease and eventually become zero. Therefore, it is unlikely that your hairdresser will be able to continue making a profit and retire in five years if the industry structure is monopolistic competition.

If the hairdressing industry was strongly competitive instead, the situation would be different. In a perfectly competitive market, firms are price takers and no single firm has the ability to influence the market price. The market price is determined by the intersection of the industry supply and demand. This means that firms are unable to make an economic profit in the long run as the market price will tend to equal the average total cost. In such a scenario, it would be difficult for your hairdresser to make a profit and retire in five years because the strong competition in the market will make it difficult to earn any profit above the normal return on the investment.
