The monopoly price is $6 and the output is 3 million because MR-MC is the highest at this point. Given Q=3 and P=6 and the firms divide the quantity demanded evenly, each firm will produce 1.5 million bottles, selling them at $6. Revenue =1.5*6=9 million. Each firm will profit=9-(1+1.5X2)=5 million.
