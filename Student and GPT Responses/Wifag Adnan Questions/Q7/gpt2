The monopoly price for the firms would be the highest point on the demand curve, which is â‚¬10 per bottle. The monopoly output would be the quantity demanded at that price, which is 0 million bottles. At this price and output level, the firms would not produce any bottles, and therefore, would not make any profits.

As for each firm's profit, the firms divide the total output produced evenly, and since the firms are not producing any bottles, their profit would be 0.
