The monopoly price is $6 and the output is 4 million because when Q=4, MR=3 million>MC=2 million but when Q=5 million, MR=1 million<MC=2 million. Each firm will produce 2 million and the revenue is 2X6=12 million. Each firm’s profit=each firm’s total revenue minus each firm’s total cost=12-(1+2X2)=7 million.
