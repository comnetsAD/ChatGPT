The Nash Equilibrium of this game is a situation where neither firm has an incentive to change its strategy given the other firm's strategy. In this case, the Nash Equilibrium is when both firms produce 2 million bottles of water each, as neither firm has an incentive to produce more than 2 million bottles. This is because if one firm produces 2.5 million bottles while the other firm produces 2 million bottles, the firm producing 2.5 million bottles will see a decrease in profit while the other firm will see an increase in profit.

At the Nash Equilibrium, the profit for each firm is 6 million (total revenue of 12 million minus total cost of 6 million).

In this case, the cooperative solution cannot be achieved if the firms only interact once. This is because the firms will not be able to sustain the cooperation for a long period of time. In other words, if the firms only interact once, the firms will have no way of ensuring that the other firm will stick to the cooperation agreement in the future. Therefore, each firm will have an incentive to cheat on the agreement and produce 2.5 million bottles of water each to maximize its own profit.
