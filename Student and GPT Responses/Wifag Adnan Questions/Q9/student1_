The Nash Equilibrium of the game is where both Perrier and Evian each produce 2.5 million bottles and earn a profit of 6.5 million. No cooperation cannot be achieved. Although both Perrier and Evian can cooperate to produce 2 million bottles and earn a higher profit of 7 million, both Perrier and Evian has incentive to cheat on the agreement so that they earn a higher profit of 7.75 million at the expense of others. Since they only interact once and will not repeat in the future, the cooperative solution cannot be achieved.
