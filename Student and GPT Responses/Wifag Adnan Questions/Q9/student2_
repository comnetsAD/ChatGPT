The Nash equilibrium is achieved when both Evian and Perrier produce 2.5 million bottles (i.e. at Q=(2.5, 2.5), Profit=(9m, 9m). The cooperative solution can be achieved as both firmâ€™s dominant strategy is to produce 2.5 million bottles. There is no benefit in producing 2 million bottles for either firm.
