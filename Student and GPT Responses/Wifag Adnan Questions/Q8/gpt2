In this matrix, each row represents a different scenario where one firm chooses to produce 2 million bottles and the other firm chooses to produce 2.5 million bottles.

In the first row, both firms choose to produce 2 million bottles. The market price (P) is determined by the total quantity supplied (Q) which is the sum of q_P and q_E, thus P = 10 - Q = 10 - (2 + 2) = 6. Given this price, the total revenue for each firm will be TR_P = P * q_P = 6 * 2 = 12 and TR_E = P * q_E = 6 * 2 = 12. The total cost for each firm is TC_P = 2 * q_P + 1 = 2 * 2 + 1 = 5 and TC_E = 2 * q_E + 1 = 2 * 2 + 1 = 5. Therefore, the profit for each firm is Profit_P = TR_P - TC_P = 12 - 5 = 7 and Profit_E = TR_E - TC_E = 12 - 5 = 7

Similarly, you can calculate the remaining rows by replacing the values of q_P and q_E for each scenario and using the formula for P, TR, TC and Profit.

In this scenario, each firm faces the same payoffs regardless of what the other firm chooses, but the price of water is affected by the total quantity supplied by both firms.
