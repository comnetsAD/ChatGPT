In the above table:
P = 10 - Q, where Q = q_P + q_E
TR_P = P * q_P and TR_E = P * q_E
TC_P = 2q_P + 1 and TC_E = 2q_E + 1
Profit_P = TR_P - TC_P and Profit_E = TR_E - TC_E

In each of the four scenarios, both firms have the same profit, which is 7.5 million when both firms produce 2.5 million bottles of water.
As you can see, the firms have an incentive to cheat on the cartel agreement, as the profit is higher if both firms produce more than 2 million bottles of water.
