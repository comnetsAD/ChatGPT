If the movie theater charges $5 per ticket, both students and professors will buy a ticket. The students' willingness to pay is $5, and the professors' willingness to pay is $10, so both groups are willing to pay $5 for a ticket.

Since the movie theater cannot price discriminate and charge different prices to different groups, it will sell 900 tickets to students and 100 tickets to professors.

The movie theater's profit can be calculated by subtracting the marginal cost from the revenue. The marginal cost per ticket is $3 and the movie theater will sell 1000 tickets at $5 each, so the profit will be (1000)($5 - $3) = $2000.

Consumer surplus is the difference between the maximum amount a consumer is willing to pay for a good and the actual price they pay. For the students, the consumer surplus is (900)($5 - $5) = $0, and for the professors, the consumer surplus is (100)($10 - $5) = $500.

Therefore, the movie theater will sell 1000 tickets, make a profit of $2000 and the consumer surplus for students is $0 and for the professors is $500.
