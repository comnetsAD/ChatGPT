The movie theater can't price discriminate and charge different prices to students and professors, so it will have to charge the same price for a movie ticket to both groups. If the movie theater charges $5 per ticket, the students are willing to pay more than the ticket price and the professors are also willing to pay more than the ticket price. So, both students and professors will buy the tickets.

The movie theater will sell 900 + 100 = 1000 tickets because there are 900 students and 100 professors in town and each person will only buy one ticket.

The movie theater's profit will be the revenue minus the costs. The revenue will be $5 x 1000 = $5000 and the costs will be $3 x 1000 = $3000, so the profit will be $5000 - $3000 = $2000.

Consumer surplus is the difference between what the consumer is willing to pay and what they actually pay. For the students, consumer surplus will be $5 - $5 = $0, and for the professors consumer surplus will be $10 - $5 = $5. The total consumer surplus will be $0 + $5 = $5.
