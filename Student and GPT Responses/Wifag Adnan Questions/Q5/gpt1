If the movie theater charges $5 per ticket, both students and professors will buy tickets. Each student's willingness to pay is $5 and each professor's willingness to pay is $10, which is greater than the price of $5. Since each person will only buy one ticket, 900 students and 100 professors will buy tickets for a total of 1000 tickets sold.

The movie theater's profit can be calculated by taking the revenue from ticket sales and subtracting the costs. The revenue from 1000 tickets sold at $5 each is $5000. Since the marginal cost per ticket is $3, the total cost is $3000. Therefore, the movie theater's profit is $5000 - $3000 = $2000.

Consumer surplus is the difference between the maximum price that consumers are willing to pay for a good and the actual price they pay. In this case, the students' consumer surplus is (9005) - (9005) = $0 and the professors' consumer surplus is (10010) - (1005) = $500.
