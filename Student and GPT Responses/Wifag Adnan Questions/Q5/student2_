Everyone will buy the tickets as the movie ticket price at $5 allows and fits everyone to buy movie tickets. Therefore, 1000 movie tickets will be sold. The profit is 1000*($5-$3)=$2,000. There is no consumer surplus for students as their willingness to pay is the same as the price of the movie ticket. The consumer surplus for teachers is $5 as their willingness to pay is at $10 and they only pay $5 (10-5=5). 100 tickets sold to teachers=100X$5=$500. Total consumer surplus=CS (students) +CS(teachers)=0+$500=$500.
