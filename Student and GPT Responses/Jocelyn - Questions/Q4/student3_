We have an evolutionary disposition to approach desirable objects such as food, and to avoid undesirable/harmful ones like poison. These tendencies are also reflected in our movements, for example, in the way in which we would pull or push toward or away from oneself. I would be quicker to pull closer things that I want and quicker to push away things I want to avoid. In the case of cake, the reaction is quicker to push it away. This is because cake is viewed as unhealthy and fatty, so people are quick to avoid it, whereas that reaction may not be as prominent, or would not elicit such a reaction, with a neutral word like window.
