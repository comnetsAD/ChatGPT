The push/pull technique is based on the evolutionary idea that humans have a faster and more efficient response to certain stimuli. Such stimuli are related to survival, like food or danger. This technique is based on the assumption that certain stimuli will elicit a stronger and faster reaction than neutral stimuli, as it was important for survival in our evolutionary history.
If people use the joystick to push the experimental word "cake" faster than the neutral word "window", it implies that they have a stronger positive association with the word "cake" than the word "window". This is because the faster reaction time is an indicator of a stronger emotional response to the experimental word, which could be due to its association with food. It could also indicate that the word "cake" is associated with more pleasure or reward than the neutral word "window".
