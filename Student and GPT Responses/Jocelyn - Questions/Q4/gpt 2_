The evolutionary rationale behind the push/pull technique is that humans have evolved to respond quickly and efficiently to certain stimuli in order to survive and thrive. The push/pull technique is based on the idea that certain stimuli, such as those associated with food or danger, will elicit a stronger and faster response than neutral stimuli. This is because in our evolutionary history, the ability to quickly respond to food and danger would have been important for survival.
If, using the joystick, people push the experimental word “cake” faster than the neutral word “window”, it suggests that they have a stronger positive association with the word "cake" than with the word "window". This is because the faster response time indicates a stronger emotional response to the experimental word, likely due to the positive association with food. It could also suggest that the word "cake" is associated with more pleasure or reward than the neutral word "window".
