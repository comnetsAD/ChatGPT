The push/pull technique is based on our evolutionary tendency to approach desirable/pleasant
things and avoid undesirable/unpleasant ones.
- The push/pull experiment is designed to measure the reaction time in milliseconds i.e the faster the response, the higher automaticity of the word displayed. In this case, the word “cake” has faster reaction time than the neutral word “window” meaning that the experimental word “cake” is a more ingrained desirable/pleasant word than the word “window”.
