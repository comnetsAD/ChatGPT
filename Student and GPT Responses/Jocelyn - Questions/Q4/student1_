(1) The evolutionary rationale is that we are wired to approach desirable things (food) and keep distance to undesirable things (dangerous animals/poison).
(2) It means that “window” is more desirable than “cake” to the participants in that particular experiment session due to whatever reasons. Because, if it takes longer for participants to push “window”, that means their instinct was (to some extent compared to cake) to “pull” the window, and “pushing” a desirable object takes more cognitive resources than “pushing” an relatively undesirable thing “cake”.
