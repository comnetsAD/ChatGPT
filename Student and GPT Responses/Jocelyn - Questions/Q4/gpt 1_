The push/pull technique is a method used in psychology to study the underlying motivations and desires that drive behavior. It is based on the idea that humans have evolved to have certain innate desires or motivations, such as the desire for food or safety. The push/pull technique is used to assess these desires by measuring how quickly an individual is willing to push or pull a joystick in response to different stimuli, such as images of food or images of danger.
If, using the joystick, people push the experimental word “cake” faster than the neutral word “window”, it means that the word "cake" evokes a stronger positive emotional reaction and a stronger motivation to approach it. It suggests that the word "cake" is associated with a desirable outcome, such as pleasure or satisfaction. The reaction of pushing faster towards the word "cake" indicates that it holds a higher value in terms of the individual's wants and desires.
