Notice the event: The lifeguard must first become aware that someone is in danger and that help is needed.
Interpret the event as an emergency: The lifeguard must recognize that the situation is critical and that immediate action is required.
Assume personal responsibility: The lifeguard must take ownership of the situation and understand that they are responsible for the outcome.
Know how to help: The lifeguard must have the necessary skills and knowledge to provide appropriate assistance.
Take action: The lifeguard must physically intervene to help the person in danger.
The common characteristic across all 5 stages that would prevent the lifeguard from helping that person is the lack of cognitive engagement, it means that the lifeguard is not paying attention, not recognizing the situation as an emergency, not assuming personal responsibility, not having the necessary skills or knowledge, or not being willing to take action.
It's worth to mention that a lifeguard should be trained in emergency response, and have a clear and well-established protocol to follow in such cases.
