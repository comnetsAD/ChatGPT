Helping other living beings can be done in 5 stages, but there are obstacles that can prevent the lifeguard from helping a person drowning, the most important one being the presence of third-party people around the scene. The first stage is to notice that something is going on, and the presence of distractions can hinder the lifeguard to notice an emergency, like stimulus overload or the presence of other people. Next would be to interpret the event as an emergency, this process can be hindered by ambiguity. Thirdly, assuming responsibility by the lifeguard to help in this event is integral, and thinking that someone else would tend to the drowning individual might cause the lifeguard to back down. Next, choosing a strategy, which can be impeded by a judgement of personal competence, where the lifeguard might not be confident that they are able to help in this situation or a cost-benefit analysis. Lastly comes the actual implementation of the strategy developed, a possible interference could be that the area is too crowded, and the lifeguard canâ€™t get to the drowning person in time, or even muscular build to carry that person to safety.
