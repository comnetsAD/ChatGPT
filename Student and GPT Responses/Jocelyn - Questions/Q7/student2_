 Depending on the situation, if it is in our school swimming pool, he/she will easily pass the 5 stages and will for sure help, but if it is a complex outdoor setting with trouble going through five stages, he/she might not.
The five stages: you must 1) notice the emergency; 2) interpret event as emergency; 3) assume responsibility for helping; 4) choose a strategy for helping; 5) be able to implement the strategy. The presence of others would prevent the lifeguard from helping that person, such as too many people cause distraction and misinterpretation of the SOS signal.
