Notice the emergency: The lifeguard must first become aware that someone is in danger and needs help. This may involve noticing the person in distress, hearing cries for help, or being alerted by another person.
Assess the situation: The lifeguard must then quickly assess the situation to determine the best course of action. This may involve evaluating the person's condition, assessing the risk to the lifeguard, and determining the appropriate rescue techniques.
Decide to act: Once the lifeguard has assessed the situation, they must then decide whether or not to act. This decision may be based on factors such as the severity of the emergency, the level of risk to the lifeguard, and the availability of other resources.
Implement the rescue: If the lifeguard decides to act, they must then implement the appropriate rescue techniques. This may involve entering the water, using rescue equipment, and providing first aid or CPR.
Evaluate the outcome: After the rescue is completed, the lifeguard must then evaluate the outcome and determine if additional medical or follow-up care is needed.
The common characteristic across all 5 stages that would prevent the lifeguard from helping that person is the lack of willingness or readiness to act, this could be due to a lack of confidence, fear or any other barrier that prevents the lifeguard from taking action.
