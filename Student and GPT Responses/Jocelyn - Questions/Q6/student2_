The first psychological strategy that has been shown effective to gain compliance when selling or buying items is the “foot in the door” strategy: where getting someone to agree to a small request increases their likelihood of agreeing to a second, larger request. The second strategy, “door in the face”, works by getting someone to refuse a large request, so they are more likely to comply to a smaller request later. The third strategy--the “low ball” strategy-- gets people to commit to a good deal that later becomes less desirable; it gains compliance because people are reluctant to break psychological commitments. The last psychological strategy to gain compliance is the “that’s not all” strategy, where a product is offered at its initial price then the deal is improved by lowering the price or adding a product with it.
Low-balling is the most effective strategy to selling an old clunker on Dubizzle.com for AED1000 because maintaining the pretense that someone is getting the best deal makes them more likely to commit to it, regardless of the quality of the product.
