 Compliance is when you change behavior when someone asks you to. The Low-Ball method is when someone commits to the offer and over time the deal gets less appealing. The Thatâ€™s Not All method is when the offer gets slightly sweeter after the recipient initially declines. The Foot in the Door Method is when you get someone to commit a small task first, and then later request something larger. The Door in the Face method is when someone refuses a large request at first and then accepts a smaller request later. The most effective method for selling an old car may be the lowball method because it uses commitment to get people to agree and makes them reluctant to break the agreement (in this case, it might be an online down payment).
