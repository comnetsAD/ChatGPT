4 Psychological Strategies: Have them complying with something small, then moving onto something larger will be easier (Foot in the Door), they deny something large so they will be more likely to comply to a smaller request (Door in the Face), getting someone to commit to a good deal that later goes bad (Low Ball), and finally, getting compliance by sweetening the deal (Thatâ€™s Not All). In a case of an old clunker, I would use the Low-Ball method. The deal may appear to be good at first, but at a closer inspection, the buyer would realize the car may not be that great after all and would be unable to back out due to the psychological process of commitment. People are reluctant to break agreements or commitments, which is what would happen in this situation.
