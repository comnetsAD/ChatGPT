Social proof: Using the actions or opinions of others to influence one's own behavior. This could be effective in selling an old clunker by highlighting the positive experiences of previous customers or providing testimonials. The psychological process associated with this strategy is normative social influence.
Scarcity: Creating a sense of urgency by highlighting the limited availability of a product or opportunity. This could be effective in selling an old clunker by emphasizing that there are only a few similar cars available at that price.

Authority: Using a credible or expert source to influence compliance. This could be effective in selling an old clunker by providing a professional inspection or certification. The psychological process associated with this strategy is the principle of authority.
