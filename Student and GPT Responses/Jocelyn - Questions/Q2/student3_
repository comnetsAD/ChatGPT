Mere exposure is the phenomena where people unconsciously tend to prefer things that they are exposed to more frequently, when they do not have a strong opinion about the issue/object in focus. This can be explained by psychological tendency to favor that which is familiar and hence associated with more comfort. It also depicts fluency, wherein things that are easier to process can generate more positive reactions- which means the more we are exposed to something the easier it can become for us to process or recognize and hence we tend to have a more positive response to it. This tells us that attitudes can be formed through learning even even more superficial affect-based and lesser cognitive processes where simply being exposed more to an entity can increase its perceived value. Moreover, people do not even have to be aware that they are being frequently exposed to this stimuli in order for the attitude to be formed, hence depicting that they can be formed subconsciously.
