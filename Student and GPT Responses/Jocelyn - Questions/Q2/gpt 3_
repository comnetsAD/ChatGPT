Mere exposure refers to the phenomenon where an individual's attitudes and preferences change in favor of stimuli that they have been repeatedly exposed to, even if the stimuli is neutral or ambiguous. This suggests that people tend to develop more positive attitudes towards familiar stimuli than unfamiliar stimuli.
The underlying psychological mechanism at work is called classical conditioning, where a neutral stimulus becomes associated with a positive or negative response through repeated exposure. This leads to familiar stimuli becoming associated with positive response and thus more appealing to the individual.
This phenomenon tells us that attitudes formation is not only based on rational thinking but also on the frequency and familiarity of exposure to a particular stimulus. It also implies that people tend to like familiar things and may develop positive attitudes towards things they are repeatedly exposed to, regardless of their actual quality.
