Mere exposure is a phenomenon in which individuals develop a preference for a stimulus (such as a person, object, or idea) simply because they have been exposed to it frequently. This can occur without any conscious evaluation or awareness of the stimulus.
The psychological mechanism at play is classical conditioning. When an individual is repeatedly exposed to a stimulus, it becomes associated with positive feelings or emotions. This leads to a positive evaluation of the stimulus, even if the individual is not aware of why they have this preference.
Mere exposure tells us that attitudes can be formed through repeated exposure, without conscious evaluation or awareness. This means that attitudes can be formed in a more automatic or unconscious way, rather than through deliberate or thoughtful consideration. This can have implications for how attitudes are formed in real-world situations, such as advertising or political campaigns, where repeated exposure to a particular message or candidate can influence attitudes without the individual being aware of it.
