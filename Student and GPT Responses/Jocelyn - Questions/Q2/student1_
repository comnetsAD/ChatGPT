The mere- exposure effect, also known as the familiarity principle, occurs when people tend to develop a preference for things we are exposed to frequently, which does not necessarily involve conscious exposure and does not depend on later recognition of these familiar things. The effect is the strongest in the absence of attitudes, i.e. neutral stimuli. Perceptual fluency is the major psychological mechanism behind this effect that refers to the idea that the easier it is to process something (e.g. with multiple exposures), the more positive affect/reaction we would have. In terms of the formation of attitudes, the mere- exposure effect suggests that attitudes develop from affect (primacy of affect) for which we would then create cognitions to explain why we have these attitudes.
