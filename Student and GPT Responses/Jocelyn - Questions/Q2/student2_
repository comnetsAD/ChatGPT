The mere-exposure effect shows that when individuals encounter a neutral or positive stimuli repeatedly, they develop a preference and liking to the stimuli due to its increasing familiarity. The psychological mechanism at play with the mere-exposure effect is perceptual fluency which produces “positive affect” and “increases pleasure”, and this affects consumers when it comes to choosing products since the products that feel dependable are remembered easier than unknown ones (Fiske, p.196). Mere-exposure effect reveals that people feel more comfortable choosing something they are familiar with and would not easily go for a choice completely unknown to them because human beings find trusting new things harder. It also shows that an individual’s attitude forms more positively around things they repeatedly encounter, and it is tough to change an attitude towards something they dislike already.
