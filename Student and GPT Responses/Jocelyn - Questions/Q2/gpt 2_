Mere exposure refers to the tendency for individuals to develop more positive attitudes towards things they are frequently exposed to, regardless of their prior knowledge or experience with it. This happens because of the psychological process of classical conditioning, where an individual associates a neutral stimulus with a positive feeling over time. It means that attitudes are not always formed through conscious thought or reasoning, but also can be formed through unconscious processes such as habituation and classical conditioning. This phenomenon has a significant impact on how we are influenced by advertising, media, and social interactions.
