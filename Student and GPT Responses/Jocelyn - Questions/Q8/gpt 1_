Catharsis is the release of pent-up emotional energy through the expression of strong feelings, such as anger or aggression. The concept of catharsis suggests that by expressing these feelings, individuals will feel better and be less likely to engage in negative behaviors.
Two explanations as to why catharsis behaviors often have the opposite intended effect are:
Reinforcement of aggressive behavior: Expressing anger or aggression can reinforce the behavior and make it more likely to occur in the future. This can lead to an increase in negative behavior rather than a decrease.
Displacement of aggression: Expressing anger or aggression towards a specific person or situation can lead to the displacement of that aggression onto other people or situations. This can also lead to an increase in negative behavior.
One reason why the idea of catharsis is still popular is that it provides a simple and understandable explanation for why people engage in negative behavior. It is an easy way to understand why people engage in aggressive behavior, which is something that can be difficult to understand from a psychological perspective. Additionally, people often have a sense of relief after expressing their emotions, which can make them believe that catharsis is effective.
