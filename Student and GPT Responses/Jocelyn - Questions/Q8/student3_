During Ancient Greek times, Aristotle came up with the notion of catharsis, which is defined as the safe release of built-up aggressive impulses that makes one less aggressive, meaning that people could be psychologically relieved from their desire to become violent if they are exposed to violence and are able to release the pressure of their frustration and anger. Catharsis can be achieved vicariously and directly, and, in both cases, there is little evidence for the effects of decreasing aggression, instead, it can actually increase it. If children vicariously achieve catharsis by watching violent TV, those who were not aggressive become aggressive in a period of 11 years, while those who were aggressive at 8 years old have no evidence of a decrease in their aggression at 19. When catharsis is achieved directly, for instance, when playing an aggressive sports game, there is evidence that it can as well increase later aggression. Thus, catharsis causes aggression because firstly, aggression can be cognitively primed, so individuals behave aggressively when they were exposed to aggression before; secondly, when people engage in aggressive behavior it is rewarded because of the good feeling of control. Even though catharsis does not work, it is still a mainstream idea because we feel good after releasing aggressive energy, however, this is only evidence for venting, which helps to reduce the arousal only temporally.
