Catharsis refers to the release of pent-up emotions through actions or behaviors, such as aggression or violence. It is the idea that expressing these emotions can relieve emotional tension and reduce feelings of aggression or anger.
Two explanations as to why catharsis behaviors often have the opposite intended effect are:
Reinforcement of aggressive behavior: Engaging in cathartic behaviors can reinforce and perpetuate aggressive behavior, making it more likely to occur in the future.
Arousal transfer: Expressing aggression in one situation can increase overall arousal levels, which can increase aggression in other situations.
One reason why the idea of catharsis is still popular is that it provides a seemingly simple and straightforward solution to the problem of aggression and anger. It is easy to understand, and it can be tempting to believe that venting emotions will automatically lead to a release of tension and a reduction in aggressive behavior. Additionally, it can be satisfying to express anger and aggression in a physical or verbal way, and this is often why people tend to think it's an effective solution.
