Catharsis is the safe release of built-up aggressive impulses that make one less aggressive. The idea was
originally used by Aristotle, but it was Freud who used the term as a therapeutic technique. There has been countless research to check the validity of the topic, and most of them have shown that is that there is little actual evidence that supports the claim that catharsis decreases aggression. In fact, the opposite may be true since the physical exertion that comes with aggression increases the arousal and anger rather than decrease it. Catharsis is popularized because we typically feel better after venting, but what is not taken into consideration, is that may be to other external factors (Such as anger naturally subsiding from body) that has nothing to do with catharsis.
