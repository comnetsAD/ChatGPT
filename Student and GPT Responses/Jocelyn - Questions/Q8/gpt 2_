Catharsis is the release of pent-up emotions, such as anger or frustration, through behavior or expression. It is the idea that expressing or releasing these emotions will lead to a sense of emotional relief or release.
Two explanations as to why catharsis behaviors often have the opposite intended effect are:
The cathartic behavior may be too intense or aggressive, leading to increased feelings of anger or frustration rather than relief.
Cathartic behavior may lead to a sense of empowerment or validation, which can lead to an increase in aggressive behavior.
One reason why the idea of catharsis is still so popular is that it is a simple, intuitive concept that is easy to understand and apply. Additionally, catharsis is often portrayed in the media and popular culture as a way to deal with negative emotions. This can lead people to believe that catharsis is an effective way to manage their emotions.
However, recent research suggests that catharsis may not be as effective as previously thought and that expressing emotions in a healthy and constructive way is more beneficial than catharsis.
