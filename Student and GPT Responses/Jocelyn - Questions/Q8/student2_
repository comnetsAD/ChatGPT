A catharsis is a safe emotional release of built-up and repressed aggressive impulses that makes a person feel less aggressive. An example of catharsis would be letting off steam by watching violence (shows, sport events, etc.) rather than engaging in it themselves. Aristotle claimed that viewing tragic plays purged negative emotions and is a psychologically cleansing experience for watchers, and Sigmund Freud popularized this idea for psychology (Lecture 15, 2022). According to Bushman et al. in Fiske’s Social Beings (pg. 336), there is no scientific evidence that supports the catharsis hypothesis that aggressive feelings could be expressed vicariously to diminish them. On the other hand, watching or playing aggressive video games for example, actually does the opposite of catharsis and increases aggression in individuals both short and long term. Catharsis is still mainstream because releasing aggressive emotions in cathartic ways only temporarily reduces those feelings, which makes people think it’s a coping mechanism that works.
