(1) Affective forecasting refers to people’s prediction of their affect (emotional state) or simply
about how they will feel in the future. 
(2) People are not good at it because studies have shown that although people predict that they will be much happier than they are if they win a lottery and will be much sadder than they are if they loose a leg, the levels of happiness reported by people who actually undergo the events are not different. More generally, I think people are not good at predicting their mental adaptability.
(3) When people are stuck in a unfavorable situation, they will develop a psychological immune
system to change their perception of the trauma and synthesize happiness to make them feel happier which proved by people’s testimonial of higher level of appreciation of life after tragedies.
