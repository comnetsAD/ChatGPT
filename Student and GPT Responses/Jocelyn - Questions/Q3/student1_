When introspecting their conscious thoughts and feelings, we engage in affective forecasting, which is predicting how events in the future will shape our emotions. We are not good in this strategy because we tend to overestimate and exaggerate our affects and duration of our reaction towards an event (durability bias): how intense and long positive events will make us happy and negative events will make us sad. As a result, we tend to believe that we would feel happy or sad forever. However, when we are stuck in a very negative situation, we are not aware of the strong unconscious ability of our psychological immune system to synthesize happiness that becomes stronger in unfavorable situations and helps us to overcome/psychologically survive the negative event (e.g. trauma, war, break-up).
