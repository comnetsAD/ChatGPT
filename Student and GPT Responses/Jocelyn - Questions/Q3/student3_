Affective forecasting is when people try to predict how future events will make them feel. While we are good at predicting that positive events will make us feel good, often overestimate how long we will feel bad after a negative event, showing that we are quite bad at it. When something bad happens, we engage in focalism which causes us to assume that the negative event will be the center of our lives and that nothing will make us feel better. And then when we feel better, we attribute it to external causes, rather than our own psychological immune system.
