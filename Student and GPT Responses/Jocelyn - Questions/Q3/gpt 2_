Affective forecasting is the ability to predict how we will feel in the future in response to a particular event or situation. It refers to the ability to anticipate one's emotional reactions to future events or outcomes.
Research suggests that we are not very good at affective forecasting. Studies have shown that people tend to overestimate the intensity and duration of their future emotional reactions. For example, people often think they will be happier or more satisfied with a new purchase than they actually are.
This is because people tend to focus on the potential positive aspects of a future event or situation and underestimate the potential negative aspects. Additionally, people tend to focus on the present moment and have a hard time imagining how their feelings might change in the future.
When we are stuck in a situation that is not favorable, our affective forecasting can be negatively impacted. People tend to overestimate the intensity and duration of negative emotions and underestimate the positive emotions, thus leading to more negative affective forecasting. In such a situation, people tend to have a more negative outlook, and this can lead to negative emotions that are harder to overcome, leading to a feeling of hopelessness.
