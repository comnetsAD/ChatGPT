Affective forecasting refers to the ability to predict how we will feel in the future in response to a particular event or situation. It is the process of predicting one's emotional state in the future and how it will affect their behavior.
Research suggests that we are not very good at affective forecasting, as we tend to overestimate the intensity and duration of our emotional response to future events. We also tend to underestimate how quickly we will adapt to new situations and return to a more neutral emotional state.
One of the reasons for this is known as the "impact bias", which refers to the tendency to overestimate the emotional impact of future events. This is due to the fact that we focus on the event itself and not on our ability to adapt and cope with it.
When we are stuck in a situation that is not favorable, affective forecasting can lead to feelings of disappointment, frustration and even despair. This can be particularly challenging if the situation is long-term, as we may find it hard to adapt and cope with the negative emotions associated with it.
