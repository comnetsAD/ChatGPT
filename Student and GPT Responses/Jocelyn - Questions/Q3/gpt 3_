Affective forecasting refers to the ability to predict one's emotional reactions to future events or outcomes. It is the ability to anticipate how we will feel in the future.
Research has shown that humans are not very accurate in affective forecasting, we tend to overestimate the intensity and duration of our future emotional reactions. For instance, we think we will be happier or more satisfied with a new purchase than we actually are.
This is because people tend to focus on the potential positive aspects of a future event or situation and overlook the potential negative aspects. Also, individuals tend to focus on the present moment and have a hard time imagining how their feelings might change in the future.
When individuals are stuck in an unfavourable situation, their affective forecasting can be negatively impacted. People tend to overestimate the intensity and duration of negative emotions and underestimate the positive emotions, leading to more negative affective forecasting. This can lead to negative emotions that are harder to overcome, resulting in a feeling of hopelessness.
