Two reasons that explain why people conform are:

Social influence: People conform to the opinions or behaviors of others in order to fit in and be accepted by a group.
Normative influence: People conform to the explicit or implicit rules or expectations of a group in order to meet social norms and avoid negative consequences.
Normative influence occurs regardless of information ambiguity.

Three factors that influence conformity are:

Group size: Larger groups tend to exert more social influence on individuals.
Group unanimity: When a group is in agreement, individuals are more likely to conform.
Group prestige: People are more likely to conform to the opinions or behaviors of a group that is perceived as high-status or respected.
