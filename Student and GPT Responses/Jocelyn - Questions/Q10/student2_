Conformity is driven by informational influence, meaning people change their behavior or opinion to conform to others who they believe have accurate information. People also conform due to normative influence, which is motivated by the need to belong and desire to gain acceptance. The first factor that influences conformity is (1) group size, where conformity increases as the size of a group increases but only to a certain extent (a group larger than 4 has diminishing returns). The second factor influencing conformity is (2) unanimity, where individuals are more likely to conform to group decisions when the rest of the group is fully in agreement to the same option. The third factor is (3) collectivistic cultures that focus more on conformity vs. individualistic cultures that focus on uniqueness (Kim & Markus, 1999). Ways to break the cycle of conformity is by sharing answers/opinions even if they might be different than othersâ€™, and by being self-confident and flexible when facing a group that does not agree with you.
