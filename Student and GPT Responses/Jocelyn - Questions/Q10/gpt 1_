Two reasons that explain why people conform are the desire for social acceptance and the belief that the group's opinions and behaviors are correct. The desire for social acceptance occurs regardless of information ambiguity.

Three factors that influence conformity are group size, unanimity, and the presence of a confident leader or authority figure. Group size refers to the number of people in the group, unanimity refers to the level of agreement among group members, and the presence of a confident leader or authority figure refers to the perceived expertise or status of the person leading the group.
