People conform due to 2 main reasons: being introduced to new information or arguments in a group discussion that may make you change your opinions or behaviors (Informational Influence) and being driven by a need to belong (Normative Influence). The 3 main things that influence conformity: group size (you are more likely to conform if there are more people), awareness of norms (you do not conform to norms if you do not know them â€“ this can also depend on the culture and the environment you are in), and finally other opinions (even if one person does not conform, then conformity would be less common among the group similar to the 12 angry men film we watched). To break conformity, then we just need to play on its influences, and going against what is expected. By following what our gut feeling is, regardless of the majority, we are encouraging other people to do the same and that makes it easier not to conform.
