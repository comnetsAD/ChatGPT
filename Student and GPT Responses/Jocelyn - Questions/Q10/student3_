Firstly, people can change their behavior and conform even though no direct request was made due to informational influences, where people are driven by motivations to be accurate and to understand the situation in which they are, meaning that they conform when information is ambiguous, and they seek certainty from others around them to make their own decision. However, people can also conform due to normative influences - when the task is very clear and unambiguous, people are driven by their willingness to belong and to fit into the social group and thus not feel isolated or excluded. One of the factors that influence conformity is a group size, where the larger the social group, the greater the conformity, which however doesnâ€™t go up as a function of group size when the group size goes beyond three or four people. Another factor that changes conformity is awareness of the norms of the social group, where cultural differences might play a role. For instance, when visiting public places in many countries it does not matter what you wear, however, in a Muslim country, when visiting public places such as mosques, people have to adhere to the conservative dress code and cover their shoulders and knees, otherwise not knowing these norms, they will not conform and violate the law. Lastly, conformity may be influenced if there are dissenters in the social group who can voice their disagreement and make other people more aware, and alert, which would likely change their behavior and break the cycle of conformity if the dissenter actually proposes valuable information.
