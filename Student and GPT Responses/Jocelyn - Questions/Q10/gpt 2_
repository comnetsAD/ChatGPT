One reason that people conform is due to the desire to fit in and be accepted by a group. People often conform to the beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors of a group in order to be perceived as a part of that group and to avoid rejection or social ostracism.

Another reason that people conform is due to the influence of authority figures. People often look to those in positions of power or authority as sources of information and guidance and may conform to their beliefs and behaviors in order to gain approval or avoid punishment.

The factor that occurs regardless of information ambiguity is the desire to fit in and be accepted by a group.

Group size: People tend to conform more when they are in a larger group, as the pressure to conform increases with the number of people in the group.

Unanimity: People tend to conform more when they perceive that others in the group are in agreement, as the pressure to conform increases when there is perceived consensus.

Public vs private responses: People tend to conform more when their responses are given publicly, as the pressure to conform increases when others can see or hear their responses.
