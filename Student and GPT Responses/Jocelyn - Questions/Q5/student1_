The fundamental attribution error is when an individual overestimates the influence of another’s personality while underestimating the influence of the environmental influences. This comes from 1) a dim awareness of another person’s environmental situation 2) categorizing situation-appropriate behavior as informative regarding an individual, and 3) our inclination to credit one’s personality and then not correcting this assumption to more equally consider the environmental factors. In other words, we automatically categorize the behavior, and then anchor that attribution error to the behavior without adjusting for the situation as a potential influence.
