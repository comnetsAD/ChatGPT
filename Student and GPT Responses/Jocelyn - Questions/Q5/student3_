Fundamental Attribution Error is the tendency to underestimate the influence of a situation on a person’s observed behavior and overestimate the influence of their personality traits. For example a person’s behavior is in a situation like being rude to a waiter is more often likened to a general trait like aggression rather than thinking that a particular situation, for example having a bad day. One reason this occurs is because we are not always aware of another’s person’s context or entire situation and can only see that particular behavior and make assumptions about that. Furthermore, the fundamental attribution error is a result of an automatic process and comes instinctually and naturally that requires time, effort and motivation to correct which people don’t often want to or have the ability to dedicate in order to correct their errors. Thirdly, attributing to character traits it is a form of self-protection, in negative situation. Because assuming that certain negative incidents occur due to the character traits of the person involved and not the situation itself, because if the situation is responsible them anyone can find themselves in that situation, including the person making the attribution. Culture can also play a role in that people from individualistic cultures tend to lay more emphasis on the individual and hence are more likely to attribute dispositional attribute rather than the large context of the situation.
