The fundamental attribution error refers to the tendency for people to explain the behavior of others in terms of internal dispositions or personality traits, while explaining their own behavior in terms of external factors or situational variables.
Three reasons why this phenomenon occurs:
Self-serving bias: People tend to view their own behavior as more influenced by situational factors, while viewing the behavior of others as more influenced by their inherent dispositions. This is because it is more self-serving to view one's own behavior as being influenced by external factors, as it absolves them of responsibility.
Limited information: People often have limited information about the context and situation surrounding the behavior of others, which can lead them to make assumptions about the person's inherent dispositions.
Confirmation bias: People tend to focus on information that confirms their existing beliefs and attitudes about others, which can lead them to view the behavior of others as a reflection of their inherent dispositions, rather than considering situational factors.
In summary, the fundamental attribution error refers to the tendency of people to attribute the behavior of others to internal dispositions, while explaining their own behavior in terms of external factors, this can be due to self-serving bias, limited information, and confirmation bias.
