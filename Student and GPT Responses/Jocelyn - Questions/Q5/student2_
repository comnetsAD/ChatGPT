Fundamental attribution error is the general tendency to overestimate the importance of personal or dispositional factors relative to environmental influences. It occurs because of:
• Dim awareness of another person's situational constraints, which are invisible and difficult to
construe properly;
• Categorizing situation‐appropriate behavior as nevertheless diagnostic about the actor; and
• People's propensity to start with the dispositional implications of behavior, but not to correct
adequately for the impact of the situation.
