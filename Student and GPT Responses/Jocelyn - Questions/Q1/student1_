The first pitfall in attitude measurement is the fatigue effect which is characterized by the decline of performance in a task that is demanding or too long. While completing the task, participants become tired and bored by the questions, so they start answering carelessly and this produces noisy and unreliable data. The second pitfall is the tendency of participants to produce desirable data by saying/doing things that are appropriate in a particular context of the task, which might contradict their true beliefs (usually occurs when participants understand the goal and/or hypothesis of the research task). The third pitfall in attitude measurement that creates inaccuracies in results is the double- barreled question that refers to the manner in which the questions are asked, in which there are two items included in the questions but participants have to give only one answer, not having an opportunity to indicate which of the items she/he answered.
