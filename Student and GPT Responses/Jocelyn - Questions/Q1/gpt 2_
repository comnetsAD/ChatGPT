Social desirability bias: This occurs when individuals respond to attitude surveys in a way that they believe is socially acceptable, rather than accurately reflecting their true attitudes. This can lead to inaccurate measurement of attitudes as individuals may not want to admit to certain views or behaviors.
Response bias: This occurs when individuals respond to attitude surveys in a way that is not reflective of their true attitudes due to the wording of the questions, the context of the survey, or the way the survey is administered. For example, if a survey is administered in a setting where individuals feel they are being watched or judged, they may be more likely to respond in a way that they think is expected of them.
Ambiguity of questions: This occurs when the questions in an attitude survey are not clear or specific enough, leading to confusion or misinterpretation among respondents. This can result in inaccurate measurement of attitudes as individuals may not understand exactly what the survey is asking.
