Response bias: This occurs when individuals respond to attitude measurement questions in a way that they believe is socially desirable, rather than providing an honest response. This can skew the results and lead to inaccurate conclusions about attitudes.
Question wording: The way a question is worded can greatly affect the response given. Questions that are vague or confusing can lead to inconsistent or unreliable responses. Additionally, leading questions that suggest a certain response can also bias the results.
Measurement error: This occurs when there is a discrepancy between an individual's true attitude and the response they provide. This can happen due to factors such as poor question design, lack of reliability, or lack of validity in the measurement instrument. This can lead to inaccurate conclusions about attitudes and can affect the overall reliability and validity of the study.
