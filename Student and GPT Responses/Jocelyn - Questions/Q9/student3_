There are three types of leadership: transactional(autocratic) transformational(democratic) and Laissez-faire.
In Laissez-faire, the leader is entirely hands-off, requiring the least amount of managerial oversight. Laissez-faire can be good or bad depending on the fir between the supervisor and the subordinate. For example, if there is a fit between the subordinate and the supervisor, where the subordinate is autonomous, it leads to better performance and motivation. However, if there is a misfit between the supervisor and subordinates, stress and lack of performance can occur.
With transactional(autocratic) leaders, they use harsh power tactics. Leaders and followers have a contractual relationship where they provide clear expectations concerning desired behaviors and outcomes. For example, transactional leaders coerce people into doing things and reward them for doing things right with a promotion. In contrast, subordinates who fail to do the tasks right would get a demotion, for instance.
 
A transformational(democratic) leader is inspirational with a clear vision, and noble motives and has a cause. They use soft power tactics. Transformational leaders engage in a lot of self-sacrifices, where they would use their salary for the benefit of the company, for instance. such leaders also have an idealized influence where they take a stand right on difficult issues, emphasizing the importance of commitment. Transformational leaders are also intellectually stimulating where when you work for transformational leaders, you will often be challenged with the tasks as they won't be monotonous. Transformational leaders become like coaches and mentors where they want to bring the best out of people and elevate them to a new standard.
Although the best approach to have a good workplace is a flexible leader, since it depends where the subordinates with a high need for closure favor harsh tactics whereas subordinates with a low need for closure favor soft tactics. With that being said, transactional leaders are more fit when it comes to increasing social capital. Transactional leaders can distribute resources the most effectively and receive resources in exchange from the subordinates. In addition, transactional leaders emphasize motives of control over resources and self‚Äêenhancement and rely on a shared understanding of and compliance with group norms.
