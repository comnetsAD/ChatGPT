The two categories include harsh and soft tactics. Power tactics that are considered harsh include: 1. Reward methods, this tactic is where a leader rewards subordinates for their compliance. 2. Coercive tactics, where a leader uses punishment to discourage the disobedience. However, for the soft category, 1. Experts, where the leader has superior skills. 2. Informational leaders that use persuasion to ensure compliance by subordinates. 3. Legitimate tactics where there is a belief that the leader has a formal right to make demands and expect subordinates to obey. 4. Referent, which is the influence based on connections to the leader or an attraction to them. Soft approaches, in my opinion, are the most influential ways to establish a trustworthy and healthy workplace environment where everyone is appreciated and actively involved in decision making instead of dreading being at work which can happen when harsh tactics are implemented.
