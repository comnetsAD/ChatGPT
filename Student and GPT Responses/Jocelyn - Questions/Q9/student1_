Two main categories of power are harsh (very direct) and soft (subtle, strategic, but not weak) power categories. The harsh category includes two power tactics (reward and coercion), in which leaders either use rewards to gain compliance from their subordinates or use coercion by making subordinates believe that they can be punished for noncompliance. The soft category includes four other power tactics: legitimate (having legitimate authority that creates a belief that a leader has a formal right to demand compliance and obedience from her/his subordinates), expert (power that comes from the perception of subordinates that a leader has superior knowledge or skills), referent (power that arises from the subordinates’ respect for or the identification with the leader, meaning that a leader acts as the role model to follow), and informational (power that results from actually having the knowledge and expertise to persuade others). Choosing which category of power is the most effective to build effective social capital in the workplace depends on the subordinates’ need for closure. People who are high on the need for closure benefit more when the leader uses tactics of the harsh category (transactional leader), gives clear-cut expectations, goals, and thus people can achieve certainty. However, people who are low on the need for closure do not benefit from transactional leaders, instead, they do not want certainty, and expect some autonomy in the work they do, so the soft power tactics are going to be better for the social capital of low on the need for closure workers.
