My colleague claims that free float is the length of time an activity may be postponed from its early start date without extending the project's conclusion date. What is meant by "free float" is the length of time one activity may be postponed without affecting the potential earliest start date of another activity. It is determined by subtracting the later completion date of one activity from the earlier beginning date of the subsequent action. It's a measure of how long a task may be postponed without having a domino effect on the rest of the project's timeline. Total Float, on the other hand, is the period by which a task may be postponed without negatively impacting the project's expected end date. The time lag is the period of time between the latest completion date of an activity and the final completion date of the project. To sum up, free float indicates how adaptable an activity is in comparison to its direct successors, while total float indicates how adaptable it is in reference to the overall project's completion. Free float and total float are crucial indicators of schedule performance and may assist detect possible schedule hazards, thus it's necessary for project schedule managers to have a firm grasp on them.
