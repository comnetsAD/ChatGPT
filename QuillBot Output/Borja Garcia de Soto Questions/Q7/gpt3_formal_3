My colleague's remark that "free float is the entire amount of time an activity may be postponed from its early start date without affecting the project's completion date" is not accurate. Because free float is the length of time an activity may be postponed without delaying the early start date of any dependent activities, this is the case. Free float is a measure of an activity's scheduling flexibility and is derived by subtracting the activity's latest ending time from the earliest start time of any dependent activity. It indicates the length of time an activity may be postponed without affecting the schedule of any dependent tasks. It is essential to grasp the distinction between free float and complete float, since they are distinct scheduling concepts. Total float is the amount of time an activity may be postponed without affecting the project's completion date. It is computed by subtracting the late start date from the early start date of an activity. Free float evaluates the flexibility of an activity within the network of activities, while total float reflects the flexibility of an activity in respect to the completion date of the project.
