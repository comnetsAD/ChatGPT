I disagree with my colleague that free float is the entire amount of time an activity may be postponed from its early start date without delaying the project's conclusion date. Free float is the time an activity may be postponed without delaying the early start date of any succeeding activity. It's the difference between the activity's latest end date and the following activity's early start date. It indicates how long an activity may be postponed without disrupting other project operations. Total Float is the amount of time an activity may be postponed without delaying the project. It's the difference between the activity's latest end date and the project's completion date. In conclusion, free float indicates an activity's flexibility relative to its immediate successors, while total float shows its flexibility relative to project completion. Free float and total float are significant indicators of schedule performance and may assist detect schedule hazards, therefore project managers must grasp them.
