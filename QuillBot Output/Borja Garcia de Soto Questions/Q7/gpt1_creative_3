My colleague claims that free float is the length of time an activity may be postponed from its early start date without extending the project's conclusion date. To put it another way, free float is the length of time an activity may be postponed without affecting the earliest possible start date of any other activities that rely on it. It is a measure of how much leeway an activity has in its timetable relative to the whole project timeline. It would be more appropriate to say that "free float" refers to the length of time that an activity may be postponed without affecting the earliest possible start date for any dependent activities. Because of the potential influence on the project timeline and the critical path, it is crucial that you fully grasp the distinction between free float and complete float. Any hiccups in the critical route will push back the project's completion date, therefore it's important to keep that timeline as accurate as possible. In conclusion, free float denotes the extent to which an activity's schedule may be moved about without influencing the schedules of its dependent activities or the completion date of the project.
