My colleague's assertion that "free float is the entire amount of time an activity may be postponed from its early start date without delaying the project's conclusion date" does not sit well with me. This is because free float is the length of time an activity may be postponed without causing any dependent actions to start later. Free float is a measure of an activity's scheduling flexibility that is computed by subtracting the most recent completion time of an activity from the earliest start time of any dependent activity. It denotes the length of time a certain task may be postponed without affecting the schedule of any dependent activities. It is critical to grasp the distinction between free float and total float since they are two distinct concepts in project scheduling. Total float is the amount of time an activity may be postponed without affecting the project's completion date, and it is computed by subtracting an activity's late start date from its early start date. In summary, free float evaluates an activity's flexibility within the network of activities, while total float measures an activity's flexibility in regard to the project's completion date.
