My colleague said that free float is the entire amount of time that an activity may be postponed from its early start date without delaying the project's conclusion date, however I disagree with that assertion. The length of time an activity may be postponed without causing any dependent activities' early start dates to be postponed is known as free float, sometimes known as total float. It shows how much flexibility in scheduling an activity has without influencing the overall timetable of the project. The phrase "free float" would be more appropriate since it would describe the length of time an activity may be postponed without affecting the early start dates of any dependent activities. Given that it may significantly affect the project timeline and the critical path, it is crucial to comprehend the distinction between free float and total float. The critical route is the order of tasks that defines the length of the project, and any delays in these tasks will push back the completion date. In conclusion, rather than the project completion date, free float refers to the degree of scheduling freedom that an activity has without compromising the schedule of the dependent activities.
