My colleague said that free float is the entire amount of time that an activity may be postponed from its early start date without delaying the project's conclusion date, however I disagree with that assertion. The length of time an activity may be postponed without affecting the early start date of any succeeding activities is known as free float. It is determined as the difference between the activity's most recent completion date and the activity's earliest start date. It shows the length of time an activity may be postponed without having an impact on any other project-related tasks. Total Float, on the other hand, is the length of time a task may be put off without pushing back the project's completion deadline. It is determined by subtracting the most recent completion date of the activity from the project's completion date. In conclusion, Total float reflects an activity's flexibility in respect to the completion of the whole project, while Free float shows an activity's flexibility in relation to its immediate successor activities. When managing a project schedule, it is crucial to have a firm grasp of the ideas of free float and total float since they serve as vital gauges of schedule performance and may be used to spot possible schedule hazards.
