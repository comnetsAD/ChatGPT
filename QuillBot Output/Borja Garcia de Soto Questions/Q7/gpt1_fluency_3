I disagree with my colleague's assertion that free float is the entire amount of time an activity may be postponed from its early start date without causing the project's completion date to be delayed. The length of time an activity may be postponed without postponing the early start date of any dependent activities is known as free float, sometimes known as complete float. It denotes the degree of scheduling flexibility that an activity has without influencing the overall timetable of the project. "Free float is the length of time an activity may be postponed without postponing the early start date of any dependent activities," a more correct description would be. The distinction between free float and complete float is vital because it may have a major influence on the project timeline and critical path. The critical route is the sequence of activities that defines the project's length, and any delay in the critical path activities will cause the project's completion date to be delayed. In summary, free float is the degree of scheduling freedom that an activity has without influencing the timetable of dependent activities and does not indicate the project completion date.
