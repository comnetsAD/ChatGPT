I disagree with my colleague's assertion that free float is the entire amount of time an activity may be postponed from its early start date without causing the project's completion date to be delayed. The length of time an activity may be postponed without postponing the start date of any following action is known as free float. It is determined as the difference between the activity's latest end date and the following activity's early start date. It shows the length of time an activity may be postponed without disrupting the rest of the project's operations. Total Float, on the other hand, is the length of time an activity may be postponed without affecting the project's completion deadline. It is measured as the difference between the latest end date of the activity and the project's completion date. In summary, Free float indicates an activity's flexibility in regard to its immediate successor activities, while Total float shows an activity's flexibility in reference to the completion of the whole project. When managing a project schedule, it is critical to grasp the concepts of free float and total float since they are crucial indicators of schedule performance and may assist detect possible schedule hazards.
