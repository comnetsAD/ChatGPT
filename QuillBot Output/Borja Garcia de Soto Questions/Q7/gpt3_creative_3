When my coworker says that "free float is the entire amount of time an activity may be postponed from its early start date without affecting the project's conclusion date," I disagree. Specifically, free float is the amount of time by which an activity may be postponed without affecting the earliest possible start date of any dependent activities. By deducting the latest completion time from the earliest start time of every dependent activity, we may determine the free float of an activity, which is a measure of its scheduling flexibility. It is a measure of how much time may pass before delaying one task would have a negative effect on the timeliness of other, related tasks. Free float and total float are two distinct concepts in project scheduling, and understanding the distinction between the two is crucial. By subtracting the late start date of an activity from its early start date, we may get the total float, or the amount of time an activity can be postponed without extending the project's completion date. To sum up, free float assesses an activity's adaptability within the context of the whole network of activities, whereas total float evaluates its adaptability in relation to the project's end date.
