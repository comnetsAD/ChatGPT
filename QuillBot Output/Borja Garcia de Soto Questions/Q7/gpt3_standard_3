The notion that "free float is the entire amount of time an activity may be postponed from its early start date without delaying the project's conclusion date" is one that my colleague made, but I disagree. This is so that any dependent activities' early start dates won't be postponed by the amount of free float that an activity may have. When determining an activity's scheduling flexibility, free float is derived by deducting the latest completion time from the earliest start time of any dependent activities. It shows the maximum amount of time an activity may be postponed without having an effect on the timing of any dependent activities. Given that free float and total float are two distinct concepts in project scheduling, it is crucial to comprehend the differences between them. Total float is derived by deducting an activity's late start date from its early start date. It is the maximum amount of time an activity may be postponed without pushing back the project's completion date. In essence, total float evaluates an activity's flexibility in regard to the project's completion date, whereas free float measures an activity's flexibility within the network of activities.
