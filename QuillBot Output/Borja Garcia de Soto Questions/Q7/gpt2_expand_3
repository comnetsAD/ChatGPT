My coworker has said that free float refers to the entire length of time that an activity may be postponed from its early start date without causing a delay in the project's conclusion date. I do not agree with this remark. The length of time that an activity may be postponed without causing the early start date of any succeeding action to be pushed back is referred to as free float. It is determined by subtracting the latest end date of the previous action from the earliest start date of the activity that will come after it. It indicates how much time an activity may be pushed back without influencing the timing of any other activities in the project timeline. Total Float, on the other hand, refers to the length of time that an activity may be postponed without causing the completion date of the project to be pushed back. It is determined by finding the time gap between the latest end date of the activity and the date when the project was ultimately finished. Therefore, to summarize, free float denotes the adaptability of an activity in connection to the activities that immediately follow it, while total float denotes the adaptability of an activity in respect to the overall completion of the project. When it comes to the management of a project's schedule, it is essential to have a thorough comprehension of the ideas of free float and total float. These are essential indications of how well the schedule is performing, and they may also assist in locating possible threats to the timetable.
