The remark made by one of my coworkers, which goes as follows: "free float is the entire amount of time an activity may be postponed from its early start date without delaying the project's conclusion date," is not one with which I agree. This is due to the fact that free float refers to the length of time that an activity's start date may be pushed back without affecting the start date of any dependent activities. Calculating an activity's free float, also known as its schedule flexibility, involves subtracting the latest completion time of an activity from the earliest start time of any dependent activity. Free float is a measure of the degree to which an activity may be rescheduled. It indicates the length of time that a certain activity may be postponed without having an effect on the schedule of any other activities that are reliant on it. Given that free float and total float are two distinct concepts in project scheduling, it is essential to have a solid understanding of the distinctions between the two. Calculating total float involves subtracting the late start date of an activity from its early start date. This allows one to determine the amount of time that an activity may be postponed without causing a delay in the completion date of the project. To summarize, free float evaluates how flexible an activity is in regard to the other activities in the network, whereas total float evaluates how flexible an activity is in relation to the date that the project is scheduled to be finished.
