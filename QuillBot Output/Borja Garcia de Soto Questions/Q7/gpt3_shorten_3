I disagree with my colleague's remark that "free float is the entire amount of time an activity may be postponed from its early start date without affecting the project's conclusion date." Free float is the time an activity may be postponed without delaying the early start date of any dependent activities. By subtracting the latest completion time of an activity from its earliest start time of each dependent activity, free float measures scheduling flexibility. It indicates how long an activity may be postponed without affecting other actions. Project scheduling involves free float and total float, which are distinct concepts. Total float is derived by subtracting an activity's late start date from its early start date. Free float assesses an activity's flexibility within the network of activities, whereas total float measures it relative to the project's completion date.
