To estimate the time required to install 70 tons of rebar for structural concrete components, we must compute the number of units and divide by the installation crew's production rate. First, we must convert 70 tons of rebar to units. Rebar weighs 2000 pounds per ton. 70 tons of rebar weighs 140,000 pounds. Thus, one rebar unit weighs 20 pounds. 140,000 pounds of rebar equals 7000 units. Divide the number of units by the installation crew's output rate. Installers produce 6.2 units each day. Installing 7000 rebar units takes. 1125.8 days = 7000 units/6.2 units/day. Thus, the project manager should bid 1126 days (1125.8 rounded up). This is an approximate estimate, as weather, site circumstances, and local labor rules may impact work time.
