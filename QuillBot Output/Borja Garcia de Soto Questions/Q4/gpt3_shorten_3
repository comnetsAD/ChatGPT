I would use this method to estimate the time needed to install 70 tons of structural concrete rebar: Duration (days) = Tons of work/Production rate (in tons per day) 70 tons of labor and 6.2 tons each day are the numbers here. 70 / 6.2 = 11.29 days for the work. I suggest the project manager bid 12 days for this assignment since it's best to round up. This estimate assumes the usual manpower and equipment configuration of a conventional installation team and an exact production rate of 6.2 units per day. Changing these assumptions might impact task length. The task's length may also be affected by weather or site-specific issues.
