We need to calculate how long the usual installation team (6.2 units per day) will take to install 70 tons of rebar for structural concrete parts. Crew output is 6.2 units/day. 70 tons of rebar weighs 154,000 pounds (2200*70=154000). The workforce can build 6.2 units each day, which is 24,677.42 pounds of rebar. 154000/24677.42 = 6.2 days. This is an estimate, because site circumstances, weather, and other variables may change the task's length. Schedules should include contingencies and safety margins. The project manager should bid 6â€“7 days for this assignment.
