Design-Bid-Build (DBB) and Design-Build (DB) are two typical construction project delivery methodologies. DBB has the following advantages: It is well-established and extensively utilized. Design and construction processes are separated, allowing for more design freedom and innovation. Allows for competitive bidding, which may result in cost savings. The owner maintains more control over the project. DBB disadvantages: longer project length The design and construction processes are not always perfectly coordinated, which may lead to delays and higher expenses. The process of design and building is less collaborative. The owner is unable to maximize value or decrease waste across all stages of the project. Benefits of DB: Reduced project duration Greater communication between design and construction teams, resulting in greater coordination and resource use. The design and construction processes are better integrated, which results in more value and less waste. More opportunities for cost reduction and innovation Disadvantages of DB include: less competitive bidding, which may result in greater costs. The owner has less influence over the project. I would pick the Design-Build (DB) project delivery approach if I wanted a collaborative strategy to maximize project outcomes, create value, and eliminate waste across all stages of the project. This is because the DB system promotes more cooperation between design and construction teams, resulting in better coordination and more effective resource use. Furthermore, the design and construction processes are more integrated, resulting in higher value and less waste. The DB system also allows for more opportunities for innovation and cost reductions.
