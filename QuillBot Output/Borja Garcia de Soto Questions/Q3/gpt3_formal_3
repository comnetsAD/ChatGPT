Design-bid-build (DBB) and design-build (DB) are two typical construction project delivery methods. Clarity of duties and obligations is one of the benefits of DBB. Competitive bidding may result in cost reductions. Design and construction are distinct processes, enabling design to be completed prior to the start of construction. Among the disadvantages of DBB are: Longer project timelines Increased probability of order modifications Limited cost-savings potential via value engineering The benefits of DB include: Reduced project durations Through value engineering, increased cooperation between design and construction teams may result in cost reductions. Single point of design and construction responsibility DB has a number of disadvantages, including the fact that a lack of competition might result in higher prices. Collaboration might result in conflicts within the design-build team. I would pick a design-build project delivery method if I want a collaborative approach to optimizing project outcomes, increasing value, and minimizing waste across all stages of the project. This is because the design-build method for more cooperation between design and construction teams, which may result in cost reductions via value engineering and a single point of accountability for design and construction.
