In the construction industry, two popular methods for delivering projects are known as design-bid-build (DBB) and design-build (DB). One of the many benefits of DBB is that it makes roles and duties quite clear. A procedure that encourages competition among bidders may result in cost reductions. Because design and construction are treated as two distinct processes, the design phase may be finished before the construction phase starts. The following is a list of DBB's drawbacks: Longer project timelines An increased propensity for the placement of change orders Value engineering offers a restricted window of opportunity for cost reductions. DB offers a number of benefits, including the following: Reduced total duration of the project Value engineering is one method that may result in cost reductions when there is more cooperation between the design and construction teams. One person is responsible for both the design and the building of the project. One of the drawbacks of DB is that there is less competition, which might result in higher prices. Conflicts may arise between members of the design-build team even when they collaborate. A design-build project delivery method is the one that I would go with if I wanted to have a collaborative manner to maximize project outcomes, create value, and eliminate waste across all stages of the project. This is due to the fact that the design-build method enables improved cooperation between the design teams and the construction teams, which may result in cost savings via value engineering and a single point of accountability for both the design and the building of the project.
