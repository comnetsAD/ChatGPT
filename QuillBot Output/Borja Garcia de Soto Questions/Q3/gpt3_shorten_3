Construction project delivery systems include DBB and DB. DBB offers clear roles and duties. Competitive bidding reduces costs. Design and construction are independent processes, enabling design to be finished before construction. DBB disadvantages: Project delays More change orders Value engineering savings are limited. DB benefits: Shorter project timelines Value engineering via design-construction cooperation may save costs. Single design-and-construction responsibility DB's drawbacks: Limited competition might raise prices. Collaboration may cause design-build disagreements. Design-build project delivery allows me to collaborate to improve project outcomes, create value, and decrease waste throughout the project. The design-build method enables design and construction teams to collaborate, which may save money via value engineering and provide a single point of accountability.
