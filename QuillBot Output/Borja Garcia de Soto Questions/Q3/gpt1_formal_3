Design-Bid-Build (DBB) and Design-Build (DB) are two typical construction industry project delivery strategies. Design-Bid-Build (DBB) is a conventional process in which the owner engages an architect or engineer to design the project and then solicits bids from contractors. The owner then chooses the contractor with the lowest proposal to construct the project. The owner has control over the design and may guarantee that it fulfills their own demands and specifications. The separation of design and construction may lessen the likelihood of disagreements between the designer and contractor. The owner is able to evaluate quotes and choose the contractor that provides the greatest value. As the design must be finalized before the project can be put out to bid, DBB may lengthen the duration of the design and construction process. Lack of coordination between the designer and the contractor may result in cost overruns and delays. The design and construction process might be less effective when the designer and contractor are unable to collaborate to optimize the project and minimize waste. Design-Build (DB) is a project delivery approach in which the owner employs a single firm to design and construct the project. This enables for more cooperation between the designer and builder, which may result in more efficient and cost-effective solutions. The design and construction process may be more efficient using DB since the designer and contractor collaborate from the beginning of the project. The design-builder is accountable for the whole project, which may result in improved collaboration and a reduced chance of delays or cost overruns. The design-builder is able to perform value engineering and optimize the project to decrease waste and maximize value. As the design-builder is responsible for both the design and building, the owner may have less influence on the design. The owner may not be able to compare quotes and choose the contractor that provides the greatest deal. There may be a lack of transparency, since the owner may not have access to the project's comprehensive cost information. I would pick the Design-Build (DB) project delivery method if I want a collaborative approach to optimizing project outcomes, increasing value, and minimizing waste across all stages of the project. This is due to the fact that the Design-Build (DB) approach permits more cooperation between the designer and contractor, which may result in more efficient and cost-effective solutions. In addition, the design-builder is accountable for the whole project, which might result in improved collaboration and a decreased likelihood of delays or cost overruns. Additionally, the design-builder may give value engineering and optimize the project to eliminate waste and boost value.
