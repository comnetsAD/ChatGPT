Construction project delivery systems include DBB and DB. Design-Bid-Build (DBB) is a classic process where the owner engages an architect or engineer to design the project and then solicits contractor bids. The owner then chooses the lowest bidder. DBB benefits: Owners may customize the design to match their needs. Separating design and construction reduces designer-contractor conflict. The owner may compare quotes and choose the best value contractor. DBB's drawbacks: The design must be finished before the project can be auctioned, which might delay construction. Designer-contractor miscommunication may cause cost overruns and delays. Designers and contractors may not collaborate to optimize the project and avoid waste, making the design and construction process less efficient. Design-Build (DB) is a project delivery approach where the owner contracts a design-builder to design and build the project. This improves designer-contractor cooperation and may save money. DB benefits: The designer and contractor work together from the start, making the design and building process more efficient. The design-builder coordinates the project, which reduces delays and cost overruns. Value engineering and optimization by the design-builder decrease waste and improve value. DB disadvantages: Since the design-builder handles both design and building, the owner may have less influence over the design. The owner may not be able to compare quotes and choose the most cost-effective contractor. The owner may not know project costs, which may reduce transparency. Design-Build (DB) project delivery allows me to collaborate to improve project outcomes, create value, and decrease waste throughout the project. Design-Build (DB) encourages designer-contractor cooperation, which may result in more efficient and cost-effective solutions. The design-builder manages the project, which improves collaboration and reduces delays and cost overruns. Value engineering and project optimization by the design-builder decrease waste and improve value.
