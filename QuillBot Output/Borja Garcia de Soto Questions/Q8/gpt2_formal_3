The assignment "concrete work in roof" requires us to calculate labor and material costs individually and then sum them together. First, labor cost: RSMeans crew code C-8 costs $3,027 day. This project requires one C-8 crew. Installing 3,800 concrete modules will cover 76,000 square feet of roof. 3,800 units / 6.2 (production rate) = 613.11 days (task time). Labor costs $1,857,622.37 ($3,027 x 613.11). Material costs are next: Materials cost 1.85 per installed unit. Materials cost $7,030 (1.85 x 3,800). We'll calculate the task's total cost by adding labor and material costs: $1,857,622.37 + $7,030 = $1,864,652.37 Thus, "concrete work in roof" costs $1,864,652.37 (labor and materials). This estimate is based on the assumptions given, but weather, site-specific problems, and unexpected changes to the scope of work might alter the final cost.
