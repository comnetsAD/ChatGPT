To determine the entire cost (labor and materials) for "roof concrete work," we must individually calculate the labor and material costs and then put them together. First, we will determine the labor cost: The daily rate for crew code C-8 at RSMeans is $3,027. We will only use one C-8 crew for this endeavor. The overall roof area is 76,000 square feet, thus 3,800 units of concrete will be required to cover it. 3,800 units multiplied by 6.2 (production rate) is 613.11 days. The entire cost of labor is $1,857,622.37 ($3,027 x 613.11) Next, we will determine the material costs: The cost of materials per installed unit is $1.85. The total cost of materials is $1,850 (1.85 x 3,800) Finally, we will include the labor and material costs to get the overall cost of the project: $1,857,622.37 + $7,030 = $1,864,652.37 Therefore, the total cost of "concrete work in roof" (labor and materials) is $1,864,652.37 It is crucial to note that this estimate is based on the stated assumptions and that additional variables, such as weather conditions, site-specific problems, and unanticipated changes to the work scope, might alter the final cost.
