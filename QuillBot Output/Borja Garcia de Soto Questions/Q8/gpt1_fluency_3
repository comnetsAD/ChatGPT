To calculate the overall cost (labor and materials) for the job "concrete work in roof," first determine the total number of installation units necessary, and then multiply that number by the cost of materials per installed unit. The labor cost is then calculated by multiplying the daily cost of the C-8 crew ($3,027) by the number of days necessary to perform the operation. Finally, we include the labor and material costs to get the overall cost of the job. Here's how it works: We must first establish the number of installation units necessary. We may utilize the roof area as a starting point for concrete construction. 76,000 square feet / 10 square feet = 7600 installation units The cost of materials is then calculated by multiplying the number of installation units by the cost per unit. 7600 x 1.85 = $14,040 We must now compute the labor cost. We'll utilize the C-8 crew's daily rate and anticipate the work will take 10 days to accomplish. 3,027 x 10 = $30,270 Finally, we include the labor and material costs to get the overall cost of the job. $30,270 + $14,040 = $44,310 So the total cost of the job "concrete work in roof" (labor and materials) is $44,310. This computation is based on the premise that the scope of work solely involves concrete work and the employment of a single C-8 crew with no modifications. It also assumes that no equipment leasing, supervision, or other indirect expenditures are required. In actuality, additional expenditures may need to be included in order to provide a more realistic estimate.
