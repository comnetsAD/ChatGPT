We must first determine the costs of labor and materials individually before adding them together to determine the total cost (labor and materials) for the job "concrete work in roof." We shall first determine the cost of labor: The daily price for RSMeans crew code C-8 is $3,027. Only one C-8 crew will be used for this project. A total of 3,800 units of concrete will be needed to build the 76,000 square feet of roof, or 76000/20. 3,800 units / 6.2 (production rate) = 613.11 days make up the task's length. $3,027 multiplied by 613.11 or $1,857,622.37 is the total cost of labor. The cost of the materials will then be determined: Each installed unit costs 1.85 in materials. Materials cost 1.85 x 3,800, which is $7,030. In order to determine the task's overall cost, we shall put the costs of labor and supplies together: $1,857,622.37 + $7,030 = $1,864,652.37 Consequently, $1,864,652.37 in labor and materials were used to complete the project "concrete work in roof." It's crucial to remember that this estimate is based on the stated assumptions and that other elements like weather, site-specific difficulties, and unanticipated changes to the scope of work might alter the final cost.
