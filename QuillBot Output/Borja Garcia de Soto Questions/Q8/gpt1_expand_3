To determine how much it will cost (in terms of both labor and materials) to complete the task known as "concrete work in roof," we must first determine the total number of installation units that will be required, and then we must multiply that figure by the price of materials for each installed unit. In order to calculate the cost of labor, we will first need to multiply the daily cost of C-8 crew ($3,027) by the number of days that will be necessary to do the task. The last step in calculating the overall cost of the project is to add up the amounts for the materials and the labor. The computation goes as follows: The first thing that has to be done is to calculate the needed quantity of installation units. We are able to utilize the surface area of the roof as a foundation for the concrete construction. 7600 installation units are equal to 76,000 square feet divided by ten square feet each. After that, we must determine the total cost of the materials by multiplying the total number of installation units by the cost of each individual unit. 7600 x 1.85 = $14,040 Right now, we have to figure out how much the labor will cost. We will calculate the cost of the work using the daily rate for a C-8 crew and will estimate that it will take 10 days to accomplish. 3,027 x 10 = $30,270 The last step in calculating the overall cost of the project is to add up the amounts for the materials and the labor. $30,270 + $14,040 = $44,310 Therefore, "concrete work in roof" comes in at a total price of $44,310, taking into account both labor and materials. It is important to point out that this estimate is predicated on the supposition that the scope of the job includes just the performance of concrete work and the use of a single C-8 crew with no alterations. Furthermore, it is assumed that there is no need for the leasing of equipment, supervision, or any other expenditures that are indirect in nature. To get a more precise estimate, it is necessary to take into account the possibility that there may be additional charges.
