It is necessary to calculate the cost of labor and materials individually before adding them together in order to arrive at an accurate estimate of the total cost (labor and materials) associated with the job of "concrete work in roof." To start, let's determine how much the labor is going to cost: The cost of operating with RSMeans crew code C-8 is $3,027 per day. For the whole of this project, we will only use a single C-8 crew. The whole surface of the roof is 76,000 square feet, which means that the installation will need 76,000/20, or 3,800 units, of concrete. The time necessary to complete the project is calculated as 3,800 units multiplied by 6.2 (the manufacturing rate), which is 613.11 days. The total cost of labor comes to $1,857,622.37 after multiplying $3,027 by 613.11. Next, we will determine how much it will cost for the materials: The price of the materials is $1.85 for each unit that is installed. 1.85 times 3,800 is equal to $7,030, which is the total cost of the materials. In the end, we will calculate the overall cost of the project by adding the cost of labor and the cost of materials together: $1,857,622.37 + $7,030 = $1,864,652.37 As a result, the sum of $1,864,652.37 is the entire cost (including labor and materials) for the activity known as "concrete work in roof." It is crucial to note that this estimate is based on the assumptions that were supplied, and that the final cost might be affected by additional variables such as weather conditions, site-specific obstacles, and unanticipated changes to the scope of the work.
