When estimating how much "concrete work in roof" will cost, it is necessary to first determine how much time and money will be spent on each component before adding them together. The labor cost will be determined first. The daily rate for crew code C-8 with RSMeans is $3,027. Only one C-8 crew will be used for this endeavor. There are a total of 76,000 square feet of roof space, which multiplied by 20 equates to 3,800 units of concrete. 3,800 x (production rate) / (units produced) = 613.11 days The sum of all labor expenses is $1,857,622.37 ($3,027 multiplied by 613.11). The cost of materials will be determined next: The price of materials for each unit after installation is $1.85. The whole price of supplies is calculated to be $7,030 (1.85 x 3,800) At last, the entire price tag will emerge after factoring in labor and material costs: $1,857,622.37 + $7,030 = $1,864,652.37 Concrete work in the roof has an estimated material and labor cost of $1,864,652.37. This estimate is based on the information supplied; however, the actual cost may vary due to a number of circumstances outside the control of the estimator, including but not limited to weather, obstacles unique to the project site, and changes to the scope of the work.
