The total labor and material cost for "concrete work in roof" is calculated by multiplying the total installation units by the cost of materials per unit. To calculate labor cost, multiply the daily cost of C-8 crew ($3,027) by the number of days needed to accomplish the task. The job cost is calculated by adding labor and material costs. Calculation: First, we must calculate installation units. Use the roof space for concrete work. 76,000 sq. ft./10 = 7600 installation units Next, multiply the number of installation units by the cost per unit to get materials costs. 7600 x 1.85 = $14,040 Calculate labor cost. We'll utilize C-8 staff daily cost and 10 days to finish. 3,027 x 10 = $30,270 The job cost is calculated by adding labor and material costs. $30,270 + $14,040 = $44,310 "Concrete work in roof" costs $44,310 (labor and materials). This estimate assumes just concrete work and a single C-8 crew without modifications. It also assumes no equipment leasing, supervision, or indirect expenditures. To generate a more precise estimate, further charges may be needed.
