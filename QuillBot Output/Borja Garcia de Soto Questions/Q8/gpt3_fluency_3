To determine the entire cost (labor and materials) for the job "concrete work in roof," we must first calculate the labor and materials costs individually, then add them together. First, we will compute the labor cost: The daily cost of RSMeans crew code C-8 is $3,027. For this project, we will only have one C-8 crew. The overall roof area is 76,000 square feet, which will need the installation of 76000/20 = 3,800 units of concrete. The task's duration is 3,800 units / 6.2 (production rate) = 613.11 days. The total labor cost is $3,027 x 613.11 = $1,857,622.37. Following that, we will compute the material cost: The material cost is $1.85 per installed unit. The total material cost is 1.85 x 3,800 = $7,030. Finally, we will include the labor and material costs to get the overall cost of the task: $1,857,622.37 + $7,030 = $1,864,652.37 As a result, the total cost of the job "concrete work in roof" (labor and materials) is $1,864,652.37. It's crucial to note that this estimate is based on the assumptions given, and that additional variables such as weather, site-specific obstacles, and unanticipated changes to the scope of work might impact the ultimate cost.
