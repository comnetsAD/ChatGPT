To calculate the total cost (labor and materials) for the job "concrete work in roof," we must first determine the number of installation units necessary, then multiply that number by the cost of materials per unit installed. The labor cost is calculated by multiplying the daily cost of C-8 crew ($3,027) by the number of days necessary to finish the project. Finally, the overall cost of the job is determined by adding the labor and material costs together. Following is the calculation: First, we must establish the needed quantity of installation units. As a foundation for concrete construction, we may utilize the roof's surface area. 76,000 square feet divided by 10 square feet yields 7,600 installation units. Next, multiply the number of installation units by the cost per unit to get the cost of materials. 7600 x 1.85 = $14,040 Now we must determine the labor cost. We will utilize the cost per day for a C-8 team and estimate the work will take 10 days to complete. 3,027 x 10 = $30,270 Finally, the overall cost of the job is determined by adding the labor and material costs together. $30,270 + $14,040 = $44,310 Therefore, the total cost of "concrete work in roof" (labor and materials) is $44,310. Notably, this figure is based on the assumption that the work scope comprises only concrete work and the utilization of a single C-8 crew with no changes. In addition, it assumes that no equipment leasing, supervision, or other indirect expenditures are required. In actuality, additional expenditures may need to be included for a more realistic assessment.
