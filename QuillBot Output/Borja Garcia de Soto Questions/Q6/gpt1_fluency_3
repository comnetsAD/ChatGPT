The painting operation will probably take less time if 4 painters work on it rather than just 1. The work will also demand less effort to finish. With 4 painters working, the job would take less than 4 days to complete since the work would be distributed among them, enabling them to do it faster. Without knowing more about the precise work at hand and the productivity of the four painters, it is difficult to determine the time with any degree of accuracy. The assignment will take less time to complete since 4 painters will be able to work on various portions of it concurrently. As a result, they will be able to work more productively and finish the job faster than they could if just one painter were there. It is important to note that this estimate is predicated on the assumption that all painters have comparable levels of expertise and that the workspace is sufficiently large to support everyone painting concurrently without interfering with one another's projects. For the task to be accomplished successfully and efficiently, good coordination and management of the workforce will also be crucial.
