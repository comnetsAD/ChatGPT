The time of the painting job will be shortened if four painters work on it. This is because more employees allow for more work to be completed in the same amount of time. However, it is vital to highlight that the task's effort will stay constant. We may use the following formula to compute the new length of the work with four painters: Original duration / number of employees Equals new duration In this example, the original length is four work days, and there are four painters. As a result, the new work length with four painters will be: four days / four painters = one day. It's vital to note that this estimate is based on the premise that all of the painters are equally talented and that the process doesn't need any more coordination or management with more painters on the job. Furthermore, the length of one day is based on an 8-hour work day. It's worth noting that, although the assignment's length has been lowered, the effort has not, and the task still requires four work days.
