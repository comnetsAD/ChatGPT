The time needed to complete the painting job may be cut in half if four painters are assigned to it. The reason for this is because having more people on the job allows for more work to be completed in the same period of time. It's worth noting, however, that the work involved in the assignment won't change. Following this approach, we may estimate how much longer the job will take with four painters. Resulting Time Period = Original Time Period Divided By Total Employees For this project, the initial plan was for four days of work time and four painters. Four painters will cut the time needed to complete the job in half. Keep in mind that this estimation presupposes that all of the painters are competent, and that the workload doesn't increase in complexity as a result of having more people working on it. Furthermore, an 8-hour workday is assumed for the 24-hour day. In spite of the job taking less time, it still requires 4 full days of labor to complete.
