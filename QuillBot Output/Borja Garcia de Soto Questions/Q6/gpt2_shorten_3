Painting takes less time with four artists. More employees mean more work in less time. The task's effort won't change. The following formula calculates the task's new duration with 4 painters: New duration = Original duration/Workers In this scenario, 4 painters worked 4 days. The revised work length with 4 painters is 4 days / 4 painters = 1 day. This estimate assumes the painters are equally competent and that extra painters don't need more coordination or administration. Additionally, one day equals eight hours of labor. Despite the task's shorter length, it still takes four workdays to complete.
