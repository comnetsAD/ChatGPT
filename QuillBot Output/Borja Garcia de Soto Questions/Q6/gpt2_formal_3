When four painters collaborate on a painting project, the time of the project is shortened. This is because more work may be completed in the same period of time with more personnel. However, it is essential to remember that the effort required to complete the activity will not change. To get the new length of the project with four painters, the following formula may be used: New duration equals Original duration divided by the number of employees. In this instance, the initial period is 4 days and the number of employees is 4. Therefore, the new length of the project with four painters will be: four days divided by four painters equals one day. It is crucial to highlight that this estimate is based on the assumption that the painters are equally talented and that adding more painters to the assignment does not need more coordination or management. In addition, the length of a day is based on an eight-hour workday. Notably, while the time of the activity has been shortened, the level of difficulty has not changed, and it still requires four days of labor.
