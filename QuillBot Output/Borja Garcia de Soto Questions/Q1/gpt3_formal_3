We may use the following method to get the EAC (Estimate At Completion) if it is not anticipated that the previous variances would occur again: EAC = (Original Budget) / (Progress Percentage) * 100 In this instance, the initial budget is $1,500 and the percentage of the project that has been completed is 40%. Inputting the following values into the formula: EAC = ($1,500) / (40%) * 100 EAC = $3,750 Consequently, the overall cost of the HVAC installation project is anticipated to be $3,750 assuming the variances seen so far do not reoccur. This is far more than the planned budget of $1,500 and the actual expenditures incurred to date of $900.
