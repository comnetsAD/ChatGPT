Estimate At Completion (EAC) is a forecast of the final price tag for a project based on its present status and expected outcomes. If you don't anticipate any more deviations from the historical average, you may use this formula to get the EAC: A project's Earned Asset Cost is calculated as follows: EAC = (Completion Budget) / (Percentage of Work Completed) x (Actual cost to date) There was an initial budget of $1,500, and so far, the project has cost an actual $900. The percentage of the total money that has been spent is 40%. Using these parameters, the formula yields: EAC = (1,500) / (40%) * (900) (900) EAC = 3750 EAC fees total $3,750. It would then be estimated to cost $3,750 to finish the project assuming the changes seen thus far were not to occur again.
