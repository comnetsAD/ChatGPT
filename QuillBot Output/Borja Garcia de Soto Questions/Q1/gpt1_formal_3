The EAC (Estimate at Completion) is a forecast of the project's total cost at completion, based on its present state and any known deviations from the original design. To compute the EAC if it is not anticipated that the previous variations would occur again, use the following formula: EAC = (Original budget) / (Work done percentage) x (Actual costs to date) Using the values provided in your question: EAC = (1,500) / (40%) x (900) = 1,500 / .4 x 900 = 3,750 Therefore, the EAC for this project is $3,750 assuming it is not anticipated that the variances seen so far would occur again. This indicates that assuming no more changes occur, the total cost of the project is anticipated to be $3,750.
