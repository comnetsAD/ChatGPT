We may use the following formula to determine the EAC (Estimate At Completion) if we assume that the changes that have occurred up to this point are not likely to occur again in the future. EAC is calculated by multiplying the "Original Budget" by "Percent Complete." In this particular scenario, the initial budget is set at $1,500, and the percentage of completion is now at 40%. After plugging in these values, the formula yields: EAC = ($1,500) / (40%) * 100 EAC = $3,750 This indicates that the overall cost of the HVAC installation project is anticipated to be $3,750, supposing that the deviations that have been seen up to this point are not anticipated to occur again. This is far more expensive than the initial budget of $1,500 and the actual expenditures incurred to this point, which total $900.
