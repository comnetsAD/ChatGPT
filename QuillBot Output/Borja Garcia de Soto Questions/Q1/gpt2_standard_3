Based on current performance, the EAC (Estimate At Completion) estimates the final cost of a project. You would use the following calculation to determine the EAC if the deviations encountered so far are not anticipated to occur again: EAC is calculated as (Budget at Completion) / (% of Work Completed) x. (Actual cost to date) In this instance, we are aware of the $1,500 initial budget, the 40% completion rate, and the $900 actual cost to date. Thus, using the following formula with these numbers: EAC = (1,500) / (40%) * (900) (900) EAC = 3750 There is a $3,750 EAC. This indicates that the project is anticipated to cost $3,750 to complete, assuming that the variances seen so far do not occur again.
