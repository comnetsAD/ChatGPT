EAC (Estimate At Completion) is an estimate of a project's total cost based on its present performance. To compute the EAC if it is not anticipated that the previous variations would occur again, you would use the following formula: EAC = (Budget at Completion) / (Percentage of Work Done) x (Actual cost to date) In this instance, the initial budget is $1,500, forty percent of the work has been performed, and the actual cost to date is $900. Consequently, entering these values into the formula: EAC = (1,500) / (40%) * (900) (900) EAC = 3750 EAC costs $3,750. This indicates that assuming the previous deviations do not occur again, completion of the project is anticipated to cost $3,750.
