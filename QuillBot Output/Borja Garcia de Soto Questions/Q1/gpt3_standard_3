We may use the following method to get the EAC (Estimate At Completion) if the variances seen so far are not anticipated to occur once more: EAC is equal to 100 times (Original Budget / Percent Complete). In this instance, the initial budget was $1,500, and 40% of it has been completed. Filling up the formula with these values: EAC = ($1,500) / (40%) * 100 EAC = $3,750 This indicates that the estimated final cost of the HVAC installation project is $3,750, assuming that the deviations encountered so far do not occur again. This is much more than the $1,500 initial budget and the $900 total expenditures to yet.
