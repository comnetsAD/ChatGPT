Estimate At Completion, or EAC for short, is an estimate of the final cost of a project based on the present performance of the project. You would use the following method to determine the EAC if it is assumed that the fluctuations that have been seen up to this point would not occur again: EAC is calculated as follows: EAC = (Budget at completion) / (Percentage of work finished) x (Actual cost to date) We are aware that the initial spending plan was for $1,500, that forty percent of the work has been finished, and that the cost that has actually been incurred up to this point is $900. Therefore, entering these values into the formula, we get: EAC = (1,500) / (40%) * (900) (900) EAC = 3750 The price of the EAC is $3,750. This indicates that the total cost of the project is projected to be $3,750 assuming the deviations that have been seen up to this point are not anticipated to occur again.
