If the fluctuations encountered so far are not predicted to occur again, we may use the following formula to determine the EAC (Estimate At Completion): (Original Budget) / (Percent Complete) * 100 = EAC In this scenario, the initial budget is $1,500, and the completion rate is 40%. Inputting the following values into the formula: EAC = ($1,500) / (40%) * 100 EAC = $3,750 This indicates that assuming the current deviations do not occur again, the total cost of the HVAC installation project is estimated to be $3,750. This is far more than the planned budget of $1,500 and the actual expenditures to date of $900.
