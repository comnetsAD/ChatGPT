Based on the project's present state and known deviations from the plan, the EAC predicts the project's total cost upon completion. If past fluctuations are unlikely to repeat, apply the following formula to compute the EAC: EAC = Original budget/Percentage of work accomplished x (Actual costs to date) Your question values: EAC = 1,500 / 40% x 900 = 3,750. If deviations don't occur again, this project's EAC is $3,750. If no changes occur, the project will cost $3,750.
