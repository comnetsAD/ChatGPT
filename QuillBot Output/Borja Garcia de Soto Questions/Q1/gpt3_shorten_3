If previous fluctuations are not predicted, we may use the following formula to determine the EAC (Estimate At Completion): EAC = Original Budget/Percent Complete * 100. This budget is $1,500 and 40% complete. This formula: EAC = ($1,500) / (40%) * 100 EAC = $3,750 If the past deviations don't repeat, the HVAC installation job will cost $3,750. This exceeds the $1,500 budget and $900 real expenditures.
