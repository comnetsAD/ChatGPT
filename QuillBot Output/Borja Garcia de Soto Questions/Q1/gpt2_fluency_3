The EAC (Estimate At Completion) is an estimate of a project's total cost based on current performance. To compute the EAC if the previous fluctuations are not likely to occur again, use the following formula: EAC = (completion budget) / (percentage of work finished) x (Actual cost to date) In this situation, we know that the initial budget was $1,500, the percentage of work finished was 40%, and the total cost to date is $900. So, putting these figures into the formula: EAC = (1,500) / (40%) * (900) (900) EAC = 3750 $3,750 is the EAC. This indicates that assuming the changes encountered so far do not occur again, the project will cost $3,750 to finish.
