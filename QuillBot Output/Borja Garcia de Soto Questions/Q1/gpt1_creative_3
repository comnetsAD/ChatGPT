The Estimate at Completion (EAC) is a projection of the final cost of the project based on the present state of the project and any known changes from the original design. If it is assumed that the observed fluctuations will not recur, then the following formula may be used to get the EAC: The Early Approval Cost is calculated as follows: EAC = (Original Budget) / (Percentage of Work Completed) x (Actual costs to date) Inputting the parameters from your inquiry: EAC = (1,500) / (40%) x (900) = 1,500 / .4 x 900 = 3,750 Consequently, if we assume that the changes we've seen so far are unlikely to recur, the EAC for this project is $3,750. If no further changes are made, the total cost of the project is estimated to be $3,750.
