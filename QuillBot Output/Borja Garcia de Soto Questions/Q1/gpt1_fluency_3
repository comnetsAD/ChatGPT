The EAC (Estimate at Completion) is a forecast of the overall cost of the project after it is finished, based on the project's present state and any known deviations from the original plan. To compute the EAC if the previous fluctuations are not likely to occur again, use the following formula: EAC = (original budget) / (work accomplished percentage) x (Actual costs to date) Inserting the values from your question: EAC = (1,500) / (40%) x (900) = 1,500 / .4 x 900 = 3,750 So, assuming the variances seen so far are not projected to occur again, the EAC for this project is $3,750. This indicates that assuming no more modifications occur, the project will cost $3,750 in total.
