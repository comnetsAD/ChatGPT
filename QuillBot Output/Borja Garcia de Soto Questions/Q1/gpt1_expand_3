The EAC, which stands for the Estimate at Completion, is a forecast of the total cost of the project after it is finished. This forecast is derived from the present state of the project as well as any known deviations from the initial plan. You may use the following method to compute the EAC if it is assumed that the fluctuations that have been seen up to this point would not occur again: EAC is calculated by multiplying the "original budget" by the "percentage of work done" (Actual costs to date) Taking into account the information provided in your question: EAC = (1,500) / (40%) x (900) = 1,500 / .4 x 900 = 3,750 Therefore, the EAC for this project is $3,750, assuming that the variances that have been encountered up to this point are not projected to occur again. This indicates that the entire cost of the project is anticipated to be $3,750, provided that there are no more modifications.
