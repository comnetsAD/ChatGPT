The following formula may be used to get the EAC (Estimate At Completion) if it is assumed that the changes seen so far will not occur again. Calculating EAC: (Original Budget) / (Percent Complete) * 100 The initial budget was $2,500, and we're already at 40% complete. Using the following data in the equation: EAC = ($1,500) / (40%) * 100 EAC = $3,750 Therefore, provided the changes seen so far are not anticipated to recur, the HVAC installation project is predicted to cost $3,750. This is far more than the planned $1,500 and the real $900 spent so far.
