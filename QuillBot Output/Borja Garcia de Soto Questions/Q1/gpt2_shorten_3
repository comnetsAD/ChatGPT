The EAC (Estimate At Completion) estimates a project's final cost based on current performance. If previous fluctuations are not predicted, apply the following formula to determine the EAC: EAC = (Budget at completion)/(% of work finished) x (Actual cost to date) The intended budget was $1,500, the proportion of work finished is 40%, and the actual cost to date is $900. Using these numbers: EAC = (1,500) / (40%) * (900) (900) EAC = 3750 EAC is $3,750. If no more deviations occur, the project should cost $3,750 to finish.
