Smoothing resources over time and leveling them out are two methods of resource management. Priorities and objectives are where the two diverge most sharply from one another. The goal of resource leveling is to keep the workload relatively constant throughout the duration of the project. It's purpose is to prevent wasteful over-allocation of resources and maximize the effectiveness of limited resources. When resources are limited on a project, resource leveling is used to distribute the workload evenly among the available personnel at each stage of the project. However, resource smoothing is an approach that attempts to even out resource use over time. It's purpose is to make resource allocation and utilization more regular and reliable throughout the course of a project's duration. The purpose of resource smoothing is to make resource utilization more predictable and consistent when there are no resource limitations on the project. I propose resource leveling if the project timeline cannot be extended. In order to prevent over-allocation of resources at any point in the project timeline, resource leveling might be used. Taking this course of action will assist eliminate the possibility of the project dragging out due to a lack of resources. While the goal of resource smoothing is to ensure that resources are used consistently and predictably, resource leveling is preferable in cases when the project timeline cannot be extended in order to guarantee timely completion.
