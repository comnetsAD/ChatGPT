Both resource leveling and resource smoothing are methods for managing resources in a project timeline. The approach of resource leveling is used to balance the workload of resources throughout the project timeline. It entails modifying task start and end dates to ensure that resources are neither over- or under-allocated at any point in the schedule. The purpose of resource leveling is to maintain the original project completion date while minimizing resource over-allocation. Resource smoothing, on the other hand, is a strategy used to reduce changes in resource burden over the project timetable. It entails altering job start and completion dates to ensure that resource burden is divided as equally as feasible throughout the project. The purpose of resource smoothing is to reduce changes in resource burden while retaining the original project completion date. If the project's length cannot be prolonged and the project's finish date cannot be pushed back, I would advocate resource leveling. This is due to the fact that resource leveling focuses on balancing the workload of resources throughout the project timeline, which may assist to guarantee that resources are not over-allocated at any point in the plan, which might result in delays. The goal of resource smoothing is to minimize variations in resource workload, which may not be as critical when the project period is constant. It is important to note that resource leveling and resource smoothing are not mutually exclusive, and they are often used in tandem as part of an overall resource management approach.
