While both resource leveling and resource smoothing are used to manage project resources, they do so in different ways and with distinct ends in mind. Adjusting the project timeline via resource leveling helps to maximize productivity and minimize waste. This process includes shifting the beginning and ending times of tasks to prevent wasteful overlap and underutilization of resources. When resources are leveled, their workloads are distributed evenly so that no one person, machine, or substance is overworked. However, resource smoothing is a method that attempts to equalize the stress on resources over time. Time-based scheduling shifts activity beginnings and endings to avoid overloading limited resources. The purpose of resource smoothing is to level off fluctuations in resource use and make it more steady and predictable. I suggest resource leveling if the project timeline cannot be extended. For this reason, resource leveling is utilized to fine-tune the project timeline and maximize resource use. It may be useful for preventing delays in project completion caused by a lack of available resources. Since we can't extend the project's deadline any more, we need to maximize our use of time and money to finish on schedule and meet our goals. In situations when the project timeline is malleable and the length may be extended, resource smoothing is an effective strategy; nevertheless, in this instance, the objective is to finish the project on time, and resource leveling is the best way to do it.
