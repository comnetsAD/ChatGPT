Although resource leveling and resource smoothing are both methods for managing resources in a project, their goals and strategies vary. To guarantee that resources are utilized effectively and efficiently, the project timeline must be leveled with resources. In order to prevent resource overallocation or underutilization, it entails changing the start and end dates of activities. The purpose of resource leveling is to prevent overloading of any resource, including people, machines, and materials, and to make sure that each resource is used to its fullest potential. On the other hand, resource smoothing is a method for balancing the burden of resources across time. In order to prevent resource saturation at any moment, it entails altering the start and end dates of operations. Resource smoothing aims to eliminate peaks and troughs in resource utilization, making resource usage more predictable and constant. I would advise resource leveling if you are unable to extend the project's timeline. Because resource leveling modifies the project timeline, resources are employed more effectively and efficiently. It may be useful to prevent delays brought on by a lack of resources. Since the project's completion date cannot be postponed, it is crucial to ensure that resources are utilized as efficiently as possible to meet the project's goals within the allotted time. However, in this scenario, the objective is to finish the project on time, and resource leveling is the ideal strategy to do this. Resource smoothing is a beneficial technique when the project timeline is flexible and the length may be extended.
