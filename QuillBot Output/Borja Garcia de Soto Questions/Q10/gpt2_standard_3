Two methods for managing resources in a project are resource leveling and resource smoothing. Their respective focuses and objectives are where the two diverge most. The goal of the resource leveling approach is to balance out the total resource utilization during the course of the project schedule. It is used to make ensuring that resources are utilised as effectively as feasible and are not ever over-allocated. When there are resource limitations on a project, resource leveling is often utilized to make sure that resources are utilised evenly across the project timeline. On the other hand, resource smoothing is a method that aims to even out resource utilization over time. In order to make sure that resources are utilized more predictably and consistently throughout the project timeline, this technique is implemented. When there are no resource limits on a project, resource smoothing is often used to increase resource utilization predictability and consistency. If there is no way to prolong the project's lifespan, I advise resource leveling. By balancing the usage of resources throughout the project timeline, you may prevent overallocation of resources at any particular period by using the resource leveling approach. This strategy will aid in ensuring that the project is finished on schedule and without delays brought on by a lack of resources. Resource leveling is the optimal strategy in cases when the project length cannot be prolonged since it is more crucial to guarantee that the project is finished on schedule. Resource smoothing seeks to make resource utilization more predictable and constant.
