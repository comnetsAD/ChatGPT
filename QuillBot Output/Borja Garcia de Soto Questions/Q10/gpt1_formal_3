Both resource leveling and resource smoothing are used to manage project resources, although their aims and procedures vary. Resource leveling is the practice of changing the project schedule to ensure efficient and effective use of resources. It includes altering the start and end dates of operations to prevent overallocation and underutilization of resources. The objective of resource leveling is to prevent overloading any resource, such as a person, machine, or material, and to optimize the usage of all resources. In contrast, resource smoothing is a method for balancing the burden of resources across time. It entails modifying the start and end dates of operations to avoid overloading resources at any one moment. The objective of resource smoothing is to make resource utilization more predictable and constant, hence reducing resource usage peaks and troughs. If you cannot prolong the term of the project, I would suggest resource leveling. The reason for this is that resource leveling modifies the project plan so that resources are used efficiently and effectively. It may aid in avoiding delays in completing operations owing to limited resources. Since the project's finish date cannot be pushed back, it is essential that the resources are used optimally to meet the project's goals within the allotted time limit. Resource smoothing is a good strategy when the project timeline is flexible and the length may be extended, but in this instance, the objective is to finish the project on time, and resource leveling is the most effective method for achieving this objective.
