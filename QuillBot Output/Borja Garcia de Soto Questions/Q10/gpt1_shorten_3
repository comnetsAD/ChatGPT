Resource leveling and resource smoothing both manage project resources, but they have distinct goals. Resource leveling adjusts the project timeline to optimize resource consumption. Adjusting activity start and end dates prevents resource overallocation and underutilization. Resource leveling prevents resource overload and optimizes resource utilization. Resource smoothing balances resource workloads throughout time. It includes rescheduling operations to avoid resource saturation. Resource smoothing eliminates resource utilization peaks and troughs. Resource leveling is a good alternative to project extension. Resource leveling changes project schedules to optimize resource consumption. It may prevent resource-related delays. To meet project goals on schedule, resources must be employed efficiently. When the project timetable is variable and the length may be extended, resource smoothing is important, but resource leveling is the best way to finish on time.
