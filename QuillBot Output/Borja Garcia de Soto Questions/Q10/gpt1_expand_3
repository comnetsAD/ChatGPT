Both resource leveling and resource smoothing are procedures that are used to manage resources in a project; nevertheless, the goals and methodologies of these two techniques are distinct from one another. The practice of altering the timeline of the project in order to guarantee that available resources are used in an effective and efficient way is referred to as resource leveling. Changing the beginning and ending times of activities is one of the steps involved in this process. The goal is to prevent resources from being underused or overcommitted. The purpose of resource leveling is to prevent any resource, whether it a person, machine, or material, from being overburdened, and to guarantee that every resource is used in the most effective manner possible. On the other side, resource smoothing is a method used to balance the burden of resources over time. It does this by spreading out the workload across time. It entails modifying the beginning and ending dates of operations to guarantee that resources are not taxed beyond their capacity at any particular point in time. The purpose of resource smoothing is to make the utilization of the resources more predictable and constant, with the intention of preventing spikes and dips in the usage of the resources. If you are unable to prolong the time of the project, I suggest increasing the available resources. Because of this, resource leveling causes adjustments to be made to the project schedule in order to guarantee that available resources are used in an effective and efficient way. It may be helpful in preventing delays in the completion of tasks that are caused by a lack of resources. Because the completion date of the project cannot be pushed back, it is essential to make certain that the available resources are utilized as effectively as possible in order to accomplish the project goals within the allotted amount of time. However, in this scenario, the objective is to finish the project on time, and the resource leveling strategy is the most effective way to accomplish this objective. Resource smoothing is a beneficial method when the project timeline is flexible and the length may be extended.
