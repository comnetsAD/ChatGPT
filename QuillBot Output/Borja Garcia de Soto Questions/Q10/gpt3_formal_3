Both resource leveling and resource smoothing are used to manage project schedule resources. Resource leveling is a method for balancing the workload of project resources over the duration of the project timeline. Adjusting the start and end dates of jobs to prevent over- or under-allocation of resources at any point in the schedule. The objective of resource leveling is to retain the original project completion date while minimizing resource over-allocation. On the other side, resource smoothing is a strategy used to reduce changes in the workload of resources across the project timeline. It entails modifying the start and end dates of tasks to ensure that the burden of the project's resources is allocated as equitably as feasible. The objective of resource smoothing is to reduce changes in resource burden while retaining the original project completion date. If the project time cannot be extended and the completion date cannot be pushed back, I would suggest implementing resource leveling. This is due to the fact that resource leveling focuses on balancing the workload of resources throughout the project timeline, which may assist guarantee that resources are not over-allocated at any point in the timetable, which might result in delays. Resource smoothing focuses on reducing variations in resource workload, which may not be as crucial when the project period is constant. Notably, resource leveling and resource smoothing are not mutually exclusive, and it is standard practice to use both as part of a comprehensive resource management approach.
