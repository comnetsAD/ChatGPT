The management of a project's resources may be accomplished using a few of different strategies, including resource leveling and resource smoothing. The primary distinction between the two may be seen in the focuses and objectives of each. The goal of the strategy known as resource leveling is to maintain a consistent level of total resource consumption over the duration of the project timeline. It serves the purpose of ensuring that resources are not over-allocated at any particular moment and that resources are utilized in the most effective manner that is feasible. It is crucial to ensure that resources are used in a balanced manner over the whole of the project timeline, which is why resource leveling is often utilized in situations in which there are resource limits on a project. On the other side, resource smoothing is a strategy that focuses on evening out the fluctuating resource use over the course of time. Its purpose is to guarantee that the project's resources are used in a way that is more predictable and constant over the course of the timetable. The purpose of resource smoothing is often to make use of resources more predictable and consistent across projects even when there are no resource limits imposed on the projects in question. In the event that the time of the project cannot be prolonged, I would suggest increasing the available resources. The method known as resource leveling enables you to maintain a consistent level of resource use over the duration of the project schedule. This method also helps to prevent resources from being overcommitted at any one point in time. Taking this method will make it more likely that the project will be finished on schedule and without any setbacks brought on by a lack of available resources. It is the goal of resource smoothing to make resource usage more predictable and consistent. However, in circumstances in which the duration of the project cannot be extended, it is of greater importance to ensure that the project is completed on time; consequently, resource leveling is the approach that will be the most effective.
