Both resource leveling and resource smoothing are strategies used to manage resources in a project, although they serve distinct purposes and have different methodologies. The practice of changing the project schedule to ensure that resources are utilised efficiently and effectively is known as resource leveling. It entails altering activity start and completion dates to ensure that resources are neither overallocated or underused. The purpose of resource leveling is to guarantee that no resource, such as a person, machine, or material, is overburdened, and that all resources are utilized optimally. Resource smoothing, on the other hand, is a strategy for balancing resource burden across time. It entails altering activity start and completion dates to ensure that resources are not overwhelmed at any one moment. The purpose of resource smoothing is to make resource utilization more predictable and constant, eliminating resource usage peaks and troughs. If you are unable to prolong the project term, I would suggest resource leveling. The reason for this is that resource leveling modifies the project schedule to guarantee that resources are utilised efficiently and effectively. It may assist to prevent resource limits that cause delays in completing tasks. Because the project's completion date cannot be postponed, it is critical to ensure that the resources are utilized optimally to meet the project goals within the time limit specified. When the project timeline is flexible and the length may be extended, resource smoothing is a valuable strategy; nevertheless, in this scenario, the aim is to finish the project on time, and resource leveling is the ideal way to do this.
