Resource leveling and resource smoothing manage project scheduling resources. Resource leveling balances resource workloads across project schedules. Adjusting task start and completion dates ensures that resources are never over- or under-allocated. Resource leveling reduces resource over-allocation while preserving project completion. Resource smoothing reduces resource workload changes over the project timeframe. It entails altering job start and completion dates to fairly balance resource burden throughout the project. Resource smoothing reduces resource burden changes while ensuring project completion. I advocate resource leveling if the project cannot be extended or postponed. Resource leveling balances resource workloads over the project timeline to avoid over-allocation, which may create delays. Resource smoothing reduces resource workload variations, which may not matter when the project length is constant. As part of a resource management approach, resource leveling and resource smoothing are often used simultaneously.
