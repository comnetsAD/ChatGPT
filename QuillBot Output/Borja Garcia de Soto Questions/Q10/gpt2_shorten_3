Resource leveling and resource smoothing manage project resources. Their priorities vary. Resource leveling balances resource utilization over the project timeframe. It prevents overallocation and maximizes resource consumption. When a project has resource limits, resource leveling is necessary to balance resource utilization across the schedule. Resource smoothing smooths resource utilization over time. It ensures constant resource consumption throughout the project timeframe. Resource smoothing is used to make resource utilization more predictable and consistent on projects without resource limitations. I advocate resource leveling if the project cannot be expanded. Resource leveling balances resource utilization across the project timeline to avoid overallocation. This method will assist finish the project on schedule without resource delays. Resource smoothing makes resource utilization more predictable and uniform, but when the project length cannot be prolonged, resource leveling is ideal to assure project completion on schedule.
