Resource leveling and resource smoothing are two approaches for managing project resources. The primary distinction between the two is their emphasis and aims. Resource leveling is a strategy for balancing total resource utilization over the project timeline. It is used to guarantee that resources are not over-allocated and that resources are utilized as effectively as feasible. When there are resource limits on a project, resource leveling is often utilized to guarantee that resources are utilised in a balanced manner across the project timetable. In contrast, resource smoothing is a strategy that focuses on smoothing out resource utilization over time. It is used to guarantee that resources are utilised in a more consistent and predictable way throughout the project timetable. When there are no resource limits on a project, resource smoothing is often used to make resource utilization more predictable and consistent. If the project cannot be expanded, I would suggest resource leveling. The approach of resource leveling enables you to balance the usage of resources across the project timeline, ensuring that resources are not over-allocated at any particular moment. This technique will assist to guarantee that the project is finished on schedule and without resource limitations. The goal of resource smoothing is to make resource utilization more predictable and constant, however when the project length cannot be prolonged, it is more necessary to guarantee that the project is finished on time, therefore resource leveling is the appropriate option.
