Resource smoothing and resource leveling are two approaches used to manage project resources. The primary distinction between the two is their emphasis and objectives. Resource leveling is a strategy that focuses on balancing the total resource consumption across the duration of the project schedule. It is used to guarantee that resources are not over-allocated and are used as effectively as possible. When there are resource limits on a project, resource leveling is often employed, and it is necessary to guarantee that resources are used in a balanced manner throughout the project timetable. Resource smoothing, on the other hand, is a strategy that aims to even out resource use over time. It is used to guarantee that resources are utilized in a more regular and predictable way over the duration of the project schedule. When there are no resource limits on a project, resource smoothing is often used to make resource utilization more predictable and consistent. If the term of the project cannot be prolonged, I would suggest resource leveling. Resource leveling is a strategy that helps you to ensure that resources are not over-allocated at any point in the project timeline. This strategy will assist guarantee that the project is finished on schedule and without resource-related delays. Resource smoothing seeks to make resource utilization more predictable and constant, however in instances when the project length cannot be prolonged, it is more necessary to finish the project on time, therefore resource leveling is the appropriate method.
