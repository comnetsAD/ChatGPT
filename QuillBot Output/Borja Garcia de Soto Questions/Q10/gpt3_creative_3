When planning a project, it is common practice to utilize resource leveling or resource smoothing to ensure that all necessary resources are allocated fairly and on time. Resource leveling is a method for distributing the burden of a project's resources evenly across time. To prevent over- or under-allocation of resources, task start and end times may need to be moved about. Resource leveling's purpose is to keep the project's due date while minimizing the overallocation of resources. On the other side, resource smoothing is a method for leveling off the burden of resources across the duration of a project. Task duration and initiation dates are adjusted so that resources are used efficiently and effectively throughout the project. Smoothing the burden of available resources helps keep projects on track to be completed by the allotted date while reducing the number of times resources are called into action. I propose resource leveling if the project timeline can't be stretched and the completion date can't be pushed back. This is due to the fact that resource leveling attempts to prevent over-allocation of resources at any one time in the project timeline, which may create delays if not addressed. When the lifetime of a project is set in stone, resource smoothing may not be as crucial as it would otherwise be because of its emphasis on reducing resource burden changes. It's important to keep in mind that resource smoothing and resource leveling may be used together; they are only two components of a larger resource management approach.
