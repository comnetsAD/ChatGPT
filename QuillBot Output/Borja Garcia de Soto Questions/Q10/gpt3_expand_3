Both resource leveling and resource smoothing are methods that may be used to manage resources within the context of a project timeline. The term "resource leveling" refers to a method that may be used to projects in order to distribute the burden of available resources evenly over the timeline of the endeavor. Adjusting the start and end dates of tasks is part of the process. This is done so that resources are neither over- or under-allocated at any point in the schedule. The objective of the resource leveling process is to reduce the over-allocation of resources while retaining the initial completion date of the project. On the other side, resource smoothing is a strategy that is used to reduce the variations in the workload of resources throughout the project timeline. This is accomplished by spreading out the burden as much as possible. It entails making changes to the dates on which tasks are scheduled to begin and end in order to guarantee that the burden of the resources is spread out as equally as feasible over the duration of the project. The objective of the resource smoothing technique is to keep the original completion date of the project in mind while minimizing the impact of changes in the workload of the resources. I would suggest resource leveling in the event that the length of the project cannot be extended and the completion date of the project cannot be postponed. This is due to the fact that resource leveling is focused on balancing the workload of resources throughout the project timeline. This may assist to ensure that resources are not over-allocated at any point in the plan, which might lead to delays in the project. When the period of the project is fixed, resource smoothing is focused on reducing variations in the burden of resources, which may not be as critical as it would otherwise be. It is important to note that resource leveling and resource smoothing are not alternatives to one another; rather, it is normal practice to utilize both of these methods simultaneously as part of an overall strategy for resource management.
