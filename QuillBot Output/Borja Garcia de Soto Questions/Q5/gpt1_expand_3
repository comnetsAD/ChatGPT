Liquidated damages, also known as LDs, refer to a pre-determined sum of money that has been agreed upon by the parties involved in a construction project. This sum of money is what the contractor will pay to the owner if they fail to finish the project on time or in accordance with the terms of the contract. Liquidated damages are intended to pay the owner for any losses or damages that have been suffered as a direct consequence of the contractor's delay in completing the work. LDs are essential to the success of construction projects because they provide the owner with a means to recoup damages sustained as a consequence of delays that were brought on by the contractor. In addition, they serve the purpose of motivating the contractor to finish the job on time by threatening them with financial penalties if they do not meet the deadline. LDs also give a method for establishing a transparent and objective measurement of delay, which helps to minimize disagreements about whether or not a delay happened, how much it cost, and who is liable for it. It is essential to point out that the amount of liquidated damages should not be seen as a punishment; rather, it should be regarded as a realistic estimate of the actual losses that the owner would suffer as a consequence of the delay in the completion of the work. It is possible that the agreement about the amount of liquidated damages will not be enforceable if the amount is either too high or too low. In addition, it is essential to be aware that liquidated damages are distinct from general damages. The latter are decided by the court and are connected to the actual losses that have been incurred by the owner; however, general damages are not stipulated in the contract. It is important to be aware of this distinction.
