The contractor must pay the owner liquidated damages (LDs) if they don't finish the job on time or according to the contract. Liquidated damages pay the owner for contractor delays. Construction projects use LDs to recover damages from contractor delays. They also encourage the contractor to finish on time by penalizing them financially. LDs also offer a clear and objective measure of delay, avoiding disagreements about whether a delay happened, how much it cost, and who was accountable. Liquidated losses should represent a realistic assessment of the owner's actual damages from the delay, not a penalty. Unenforceable liquidated damages may be excessively large or cheap. Liquidated damages are distinct from general damages, which are decided by the court and connected to the owner's real losses.
