Liquidated damages are a contract-stipulated quantity of money that the contractor must pay to the owner if they fail to achieve specific performance conditions, such as finishing the project on time or within budget. They are often included in building contracts to encourage the contractor to adhere to the agreed-upon timeline and budget. In building projects, liquidated damages are crucial for several reasons. They offer the contractor with a financial incentive to achieve the project's deadline: By prescribing a financial penalty for delays, liquidated damages incentivize the contractor to finish the job on time. They provide some recompense to the owner: If the contractor fails to meet the deadline, liquidated damages allow the owner to recover any extra expenses or lost income caused by the delay. They provide a transparent and objective measurement of delay: In the case of a disagreement, liquidated damages give a clear and objective measure of delay for determining the amount of damages to be paid. They may aid in risk mitigation: By including liquidated damages into the contract, both parties may more accurately estimate and prepare for the possible financial effect of delays. Importantly, liquidated damages should represent a realistic assessment of the actual losses that the owner would pay as a result of the delay, not a penalty. In addition, liquidated damages must be explicitly specified and mentioned in the contract, as well as examined and agreed upon by both parties prior to contract execution.
