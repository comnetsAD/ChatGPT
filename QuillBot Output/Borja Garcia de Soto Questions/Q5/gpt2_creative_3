In the event that one of the parties to a construction contract fails to fulfill its responsibilities, the other parties to the contract may seek compensation from that party in the form of liquidated damages (LD), which are agreed upon monetary amounts that serve as compensation for that party's breach. It is common for contracts to contain such a provision, the purpose of which is to reimburse the non-breaching party for any damages sustained as a consequence of the breaching party's delay or failure. Late fees are often expressed as a flat rate per calendar day, week, or month. They help parties to a building contract comprehend and quantify the possible financial penalties of not completing their contractual commitments, making them an essential tool. A party inclined to induce delays or defaults may be dissuaded by this. Furthermore, they may aid in providing the project's stakeholders with a feeling of certainty and predictability, which is useful for setting realistic expectations and establishing a budget. Liquidated Losses are not fines but rather a reasonable assessment of the real damages that the non-breaching party would suffer in the event of a breach. Thus, liquidated damages should be fair, not exorbitant, and equal to or greater than the actual losses that the non-breaching party would suffer as a result of the breach. Also, it's important to have a lawyer go through any Liquidated Damages provisions to make sure they're legal in the state or country where the project is being built and that the damages awarded are fair and not a punishment.
