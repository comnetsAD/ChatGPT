Liquidated damages (LDs) are a predetermined amount of money agreed upon by the parties engaged in a construction project, which the contractor will pay to the owner if they fail to finish the project on time or in line with the conditions of the contract. Liquidated damages are intended to recompense the owner for any losses or damages sustained as a consequence of the contractor's delay. LDs are significant in construction projects because they allow the owner to recoup damages stemming from contractor-caused delays. They also provide as an incentive for the contractor to finish the job on time, since they will be punished financially if they do not. LDs also give a method for establishing a clear and objective measure of delay, so preventing disagreements about whether a delay happened, how much it cost, and who is accountable. The amount of liquidated damages should be a realistic assessment of the actual losses incurred by the owner as a consequence of the delay, not a penalty. If the sum of liquidated damages is too large or low, it may not be enforceable. In addition, it is essential to understand that Liquidated damages are distinct from general damages, which are assessed by the court and are based on the actual losses incurred by the owner, but are not stipulated in the contract.
