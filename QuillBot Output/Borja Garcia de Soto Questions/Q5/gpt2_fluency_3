Liquidated damages (LD) are monetary sums agreed upon by the parties to a construction contract as a preset type of compensation for a party's failure to satisfy its contractual duties. This is usually incorporated as a provision in the contract and is designed to reimburse the non-breaching party for damages suffered as a consequence of the delay or default. They are often computed as a set financial sum per day, week, or month of lateness. They are crucial in construction projects because they give a clear and quantitative mechanism for the parties to comprehend and quantify the financial repercussions of failing to satisfy their contractual commitments. This may serve as a deterrent to those who may be inclined to create delays or defaults. Furthermore, they may serve to offer a feeling of certainty and predictability for the project's participants, which can be good for budgeting and planning reasons. It should be noted that Liquidated Losses are not considered penalties, but rather a reasonable assessment of the real damages that the non-breaching party would face. As a result, the amount of liquidated damages should be fair, not extravagant, and not less than the actual losses incurred by the non-breaching party. Furthermore, legal professionals should analyze Liquidated Damages provisions to verify that they conform with the rules of the country in which the project is situated, and that the amount is acceptable and not regarded a punishment.
