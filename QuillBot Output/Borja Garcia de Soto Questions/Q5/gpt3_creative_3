If the contractor fails to achieve the contract's performance conditions, such as finishing the project on schedule or within budget, the contractor may be liable to pay the owner liquidated damages. In construction contracts, they provide as an incentive for the contractor to complete the project on time and within the allotted budget. Multiple factors make liquidated damages an essential part of building projects: They provide the contractor financial motivation to stick to the established timeline: Liquidated damages provide financial incentive to the contractor to finish the job on schedule by outlining a financial penalty for delays. They're a kind of recompense to the owner: Liquidated damages allow the owner to recover some or all of the expenditures and income lost as a consequence of the contractor's failure to fulfill the timetable. They provide an unambiguous and unbiased way to quantify time lost: Liquidated damages give an easy-to-understand, measurable standard for calculating the amount of money that must be paid in the case of a dispute due to delay. They are useful for lowering danger: The parties may better prepare for the financial effect of delays by incorporating liquidated damages in the contract. Liquidated losses should not be seen as a punishment but rather as a fair assessment of the real damages the owner would suffer as a result of the delay. Liquidated damages should also be included in the contract, evaluated by both parties, and agreed upon before the contract is signed.
