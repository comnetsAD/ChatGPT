For construction projects, the parties may agree upon a quantity of money called "liquidated damages" (LDs) that the contractor will pay to the owner if they fail to finish the project on time or as agreed upon in the contract. Liquidated damages are meant to pay the owner for any losses or damages that may have occurred as a consequence of the contractor's delay. LDs play a crucial role in the construction industry since they allow the owner to recoup costs associated with the project's delay from the contractor. They also operate as a financial deterrent for the contractor who is not able to meet their deadlines. A further benefit of LDs is that they may be used to produce an objective measure of delay, helping to eliminate arguments about whether or not a delay happened, how much it cost, and who was to blame. The amount of liquidated damages is not a punishment but rather an estimate of the real losses the owner would experience as a consequence of the delay. Liquidated damages may be ruled unenforceable if the sum is too high or low. It's also worth noting that Liquidated damages are distinct from general damages, which are those that are not specified in the contract but are instead based on the owner's real losses and decided by the court.
