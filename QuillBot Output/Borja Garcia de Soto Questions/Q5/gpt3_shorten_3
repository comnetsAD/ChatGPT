If a contractor fails to finish a project on schedule or within budget, they must pay the owner liquidated damages. They incentivize contractors to fulfill schedules and budgets in building contracts. Construction projects need liquidated damages for numerous reasons: They financially reward contractors that achieve project deadlines: Liquidated damages motivate contractors to finish on time by imposing a financial penalty for delays. They compensate owners: Liquidated damages allow the owner to recover delays-related expenses and income from the contractor. They quantify delay: Liquidated damages may be used to calculate damages in a dispute by measuring delay. Risk reduction: Liquidated damages let both parties estimate and prepare for delays' financial effect. Liquidated losses should represent a realistic assessment of the owner's delay-related damages, not a penalty. Before signing the contract, both parties should agree on liquidated damages.
