Liquidated damages (LD) are a preset sum of money agreed upon by the parties to a construction contract as compensation for a party's failure to fulfill its contractual duties. This is often a contractual provision designed to reimburse the non-breaching party for damages sustained as a consequence of the delay or default. Typically, they are computed as a monetary sum per day, week, or month of delay. They are crucial in construction projects because they give a clear and quantifiable manner for the parties to comprehend and quantify the possible financial repercussions of failing to satisfy contractual commitments. This may serve as a disincentive for a party inclined to induce delays or defaults. In addition, they may give the parties concerned with a feeling of certainty and predictability, which can be advantageous for budgeting and planning reasons. Not to be confused with fines, Liquidated Losses are a reasonable assessment of the real damages that the non-breaching party would suffer. Therefore, the amount of liquidated damages must be fair, not extravagant, and not less than the real losses that the non-breaching party would pay. In addition, legal professionals should analyze Liquidated Damages provisions to verify that they conform with the laws of the country where the project is situated and that the amount is acceptable and not regarded a punishment.
