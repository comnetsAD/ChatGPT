Liquidated damages (LDs) are pre-determined sums of money agreed upon by the parties engaged in a construction project that the contractor would pay to the owner if the project is not completed on time or according to the contract requirements. Liquidated damages are intended to repay the owner for any losses or damages suffered as a consequence of the contractor's delay. LDs are crucial in construction projects because they allow the owner to recover damages due by delays induced by the contractor. They also serve as an incentive for the contractor to execute the job on schedule, since failure to do so would result in financial penalties. LDs also allow for the establishment of a clear and objective measure of delay, avoiding disagreements about whether a delay happened, how much it cost, and who is to blame. It should be noted that the amount of liquidated damages should represent a realistic estimate of the actual losses that the owner would experience as a consequence of the delay, rather than a penalty. If the sum of liquidated damages is too large or excessively low, it may be deemed unenforceable. Also, it's vital to understand that liquidated damages vary from general damages, which are assessed by the court and are tied to the actual losses suffered by the owner, rather than being agreed to in the contract.
