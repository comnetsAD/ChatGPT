A fixed sum of money known as liquidated damages (LD) is set by the parties to a construction contract as a form of restitution for a party's breach of the terms of the contract. This usually appears as a provision in the contract and is meant to make up for damages suffered by the non-breaching party as a consequence of the delay or default. Typically, they are determined as a set financial sum each extra day, week, or month. They are crucial in building projects because they provide the parties a mechanism to comprehend and quantify the possible financial repercussions of failing to uphold their contractual commitments. The party who could be inclined to produce delays or defaults may be discouraged by this. They may also contribute to a feeling of predictability and assurance among the project's participants, which is advantageous for planning and budgeting. It's crucial to remember that liquidated damages are an accurate estimate of the real losses the non-breaching party would suffer, not a punishment. Since the non-breaching party is likely to suffer real harm, the amount of liquidated damages should be appropriate, not extravagant, and not less than that. Legal professionals should also analyze Liquidated Damages provisions to make sure they are compliant with applicable laws in the country where the project is situated and that the sum is acceptable and not seen as a fine.
