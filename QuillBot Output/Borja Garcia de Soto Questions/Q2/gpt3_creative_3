The Critical Path Method is the best resource management strategy for a construction project like building a hotel on Yas Island, where the owner cares a great deal about getting the hotel completed in time for the beginning of the tourist season and full occupancy is anticipated (CPM). CPM, or critical path method, is a method of project management that visualizes the project timeline as a network diagram. As the name implies, it is used to locate the "critical path" of a project, or the chain of steps that will decide how quickly the work can be finished. Project managers are able to allocate more time and resources to the tasks that have the greatest influence on the project's end date because to CPM's ability to isolate the critical route. CPM's major feature is its use of forward and backward passes to determine when tasks may begin and end at the earliest possible times. Project managers may then allocate resources in accordance with the critical route. Another benefit of CPM is that it helps managers figure out how much time they have to spare between tasks. An activity's float time is the length of time it may be postponed without significantly affecting the timeline of the project as a whole. By concentrating on the key path tasks, project managers may save time and money by identifying those that can be put off without jeopardizing the project's completion. To better plan and use the project's resources, CPM may be used to determine the critical route and prioritize the tasks that have the most influence on the project's end date. It can also reveal the slack time on activities.
