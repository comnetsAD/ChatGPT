Critical Path Method is the most suitable resource management approach for a building project such as the construction of a hotel on Yas Island, where the owner is particularly concerned with having the hotel ready for the start of the tourist season and full occupancy is anticipated (CPM). CPM is a project management approach that represents the project timeline using a network diagram. It is used to establish a project's critical path, which is the sequence of events that determines the earliest possible completion date. By determining the critical route, CPM enables project managers to prioritize the tasks that have the greatest influence on the completion date. CPM is distinguished by its use of a forward pass and a backward pass to determine the earliest start and end timings for each activity. This helps project managers to determine the critical route and consequently arrange resources. CPM also enables project managers to detect the float or slack time associated with each activity. Float time is the length of time that an activity may be postponed without delaying the completion of the project as a whole. This enables project managers to identify tasks that may be postponed without delaying the project and to maximize resource utilization by concentrating on the key route activities. In this situation, the use of CPM can help you optimize the project's resources by identifying the critical path and focusing on the activities that have the greatest impact on the project's completion date. Furthermore, it can make you aware of the slack time on activities, allowing you to plan and make better use of the resources.
