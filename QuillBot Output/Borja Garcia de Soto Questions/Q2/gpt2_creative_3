Critical Path Method is the best option for managing project resources at this time (CPM). Planning, scheduling, and controlling a project with CPM allows you to pinpoint the tasks that, if delayed, would have a domino effect on the whole project. Finding the float time for low-priority tasks is also aided by this method. By concentrating on the critical route and making sure that the resources are accessible when they are required, CPM makes it feasible to optimize the project's resources. CPM is ideal for this project because it can help determine which tasks and activities are most important, allowing for a more strategic allocation of time and money. Because of the owner's focus on meeting the completion deadline, CPM may be used to foresee and correct possible causes of delay and to make the most efficient use of available resources. CPM's ability to estimate how much wiggle room to provide yourself for non-urgent tasks also facilitates resource prioritization and guarantees that your project will be finished on schedule with little to no overrun. In conclusion, CPM's use here will allow for more efficient use of resources and better timeline management, both of which are vital to the project's success given the owner's goals and the anticipated high occupancy levels during the peak tourist season.
