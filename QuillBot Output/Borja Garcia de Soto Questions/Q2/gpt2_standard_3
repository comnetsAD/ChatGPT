The "Critical Path Method" would be the best resource management method for this project (CPM). It helps to identify the critical route and the important activities, which are the ones that, if delayed, would cause the project to be delayed. CPM is a technique used to plan, schedule, and manage a project. Determining the float time for non-critical operations is also helpful. By concentrating on the critical route and ensuring that the essential resources are accessible when they are needed, CPM makes it feasible to maximize the project's resource use. Because it enables the identification of the most important tasks and activities, which can subsequently be given priority in terms of resources and time, CPM is especially well-suited for this project. With the owner placing a strong focus on on-time completion, CPM can assist in identifying and minimizing any possible delays that can arise as well as maximizing the utilization of resources to guarantee that the project is finished on time. Additionally, CPM's capacity to ascertain the float time for non-critical operations may aid in resource prioritization and guarantee that the project is finished on schedule with the least amount of delay. Conclusion: Given the owner's interests and the anticipated full occupancy during the tourist season, the application of CPM in this project may assist maximize the use of resources and guarantee that the project is finished on time, which is essential for its success.
