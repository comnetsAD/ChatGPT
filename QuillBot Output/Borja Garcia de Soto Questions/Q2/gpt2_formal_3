Critical Path Method would be the most suitable method of resource management for this undertaking (CPM). CPM is a strategy used to plan, schedule, and manage a project. It helps to identify the critical route and the important activities, which are the activities that, if postponed, would delay the project. In addition, it helps establish the float time for non-critical tasks. With CPM, it is feasible to optimize the project's resources by concentrating on the critical route and ensuring that the required resources are accessible at the appropriate time. This project is well suited for CPM since it enables the identification of the most important tasks and activities, which can then be prioritized in terms of resources and timeline. With the owner's focus on on-time completion, CPM can assist in identifying and mitigating possible delays and optimizing resource use to guarantee the project is finished on time. In addition, the capability of CPM to compute the float time for non-critical operations helps allocate resources and ensures the project is finished on schedule with little delay. CPM may optimize the use of resources and assist guarantee the project is finished on time, which is essential for the project's success given the owner's interests and the anticipated full occupancy throughout the tourist season.
