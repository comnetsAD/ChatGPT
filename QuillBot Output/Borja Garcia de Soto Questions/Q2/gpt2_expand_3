The "Critical Path Method" is the strategy for the management of resources that is going to be the most effective for this project (CPM). CPM is a method that is used to plan, schedule, and control a project. It helps to identify the critical path and the critical activities, which are the activities that, if they are delayed, will cause the project to be delayed. CPM also helps to identify the critical path and the critical activities. In addition, it is helpful in determining the float time for operations that are not vital. By concentrating on the critical route of the project and making certain that the required resources are accessible when they are required, it is feasible to maximize the use of the project's available resources with the help of CPM. CPM is especially well-suited for this project because it enables the identification of the tasks and activities that are most crucial to the completion of the work, which can then be given priority in terms of the resources available and the timetable. CPM may assist detect and eliminate any possible delays that might arise and optimize the allocation of resources to guarantee that the project is finished on schedule to accommodate the priority that the owner places on the timely completion of the work. In addition, the capability of CPM to ascertain the float time for non-critical operations may assist in the prioritization of resources, which in turn helps to guarantee that the project will be finished on schedule with a minimum of delay. To summarize, the application of CPM in this project has the potential to maximize the efficiency with which resources are used and to contribute to the timely completion of the project, both of which are essential to the success of the project given the owner's interests and the anticipated high occupancy levels during the tourist season.
