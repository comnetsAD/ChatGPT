The most suitable resource management strategy to apply for a project like the building of a hotel on Yas Island, where the owner is highly interested in getting the hotel completed on time and full occupancy is anticipated, would be Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM). The following are the primary features of CCPM: Rather than concentrating just on controlling the schedule, it manages the resources (people, tools, and materials) required to accomplish the project. It does not depend on "contingency" time built into the schedule, but rather employs a "buffer" to allow for uncertainty and anticipated delays in the project. To keep the project on track and on schedule, it gives priority to the most important activities and resources. By identifying the key route and ensuring that resources are allocated to the most crucial activities, CCPM contributes to the project's resource optimization. This is significant in projects like the building of hotels, where finishing on time is essential to being ready for the start of the tourist season. Additionally, by employing buffers to take uncertainty into account, CCPM aids in reducing the likelihood of delays. Even if there are unforeseen delays or problems, doing this may assist guarantee that the project is completed on schedule. Overall, by using CCPM in this project, the major goal of the project—ensuring that the hotel is open in time for the start of the tourist season—will be achieved.
