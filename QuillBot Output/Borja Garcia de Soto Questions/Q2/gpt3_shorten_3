Critical Path Method is the best resource management strategy for a construction project like building a hotel on Yas Island, where the owner wants the hotel ready for the tourist season and expects full occupancy (CPM). CPM employs network diagrams to show project schedules. It identifies a project's critical pathâ€”the sequence of actions that defines its earliest completion date. CPM helps project managers prioritize tasks that affect project completion by determining the critical route. CPM calculates the earliest start and end timings for each activity using forward and backward passes. Project managers can determine the critical route and plan resources. CPM also helps project managers discover activity drift or idle time. Float time is the time an activity may be postponed without delaying the project. Project managers may identify tasks that can be postponed without delaying the project and concentrate on essential route activities to optimize resource usage. In this situation, CPM can help you optimize project resources by identifying the key route and concentrating on the activities that have the most influence on the project's completion date, as well as detecting slack time on tasks so you can better plan and utilize resources.
