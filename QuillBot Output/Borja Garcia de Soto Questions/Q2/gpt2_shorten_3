This project needs "Critical Path Method" resource management (CPM). CPM helps identify the key route and essential tasks, which if delayed would postpone the project. It calculates non-critical activity float time. CPM optimizes project resources by concentrating on the critical route and ensuring that resources are accessible when required. CPM is ideal for this project since it identifies the most important tasks and activities and prioritizes them for resources and time. CPM can detect and reduce delays and optimize resource allocation to meet the owner's on-time completion goal. CPM may also identify the float time for non-critical operations, which helps allocate resources and finish the project on schedule. In conclusion, CPM can optimize resource utilization and assist finish the project on schedule, which is vital given the owner's interests and the predicted full occupancy during the tourist season.
