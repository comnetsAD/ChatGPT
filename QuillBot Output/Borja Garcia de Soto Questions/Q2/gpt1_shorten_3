Critical Chain Project Management is best for a project like building a hotel on Yas Island, where the owner wants it finished on time and expects full occupancy (CCPM). CCPM manages project resources—people, equipment, and materials—rather than merely the timetable. Instead of scheduling "contingency" time, it employs a "buffer" to accommodate for project uncertainty and delays. It prioritizes essential activities and resources to keep the project on track and on schedule. By identifying the essential route and prioritizing activities, CCPM optimizes project resources. In a hotel building project, meeting the timetable is key to being ready for the tourist season. CCPM buffers uncertainty to reduce delay concerns. Even with delays or challenges, this may help accomplish the job on schedule. CCPM will optimize resources and guarantee the hotel is ready for the tourist season, the project's key goal.
