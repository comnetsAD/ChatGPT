Critical Chain Project Management is the most suitable resource management approach for a project like the development of a hotel on Yas Island, where the owner is particularly concerned with getting the hotel completed on time and full occupancy is anticipated (CCPM). Mainly, CCPM differs from traditional project management in that it places more emphasis on managing the people, machines, and materials (PME) necessary to finish the project than on controlling the time frame. Instead of counting on "contingency" time in the schedule, it employs a "buffer" to accommodate for uncertainty and anticipated delays in the project. Essential steps and materials are given top billing to keep the project on track and on schedule. By pinpointing the project's critical route and prioritizing the most essential activities, CCPM aids in optimizing available resources. For a project like a hotel, where finishing on time is absolutely necessary so that it can open in time for the busy tourist season, this is of the utmost importance. In addition, CCPM's use of buffers to account for uncertainty helps to reduce the risks of delays. A timely completion of the project may be more likely if this is done, even if problems or delays emerge along the way. The overall goal of this project is to have the hotel open for the start of the tourist season, therefore using CCPM to manage the project's resources will assist get us there faster.
