The most suitable resource management approach to apply for a project like the building of a hotel on Yas Island, where the owner is highly interested in having the hotel completed on time and full occupancy is anticipated, would be Critical Chain Project Management (CCPM). CCPM's primary features are as follows: It focuses on managing the resources (people, equipment, materials) required to execute the project rather than merely the timeline. Rather to depending on "contingency" time built into the plan, it employs a "buffer" to accommodate for uncertainty and unexpected delays in the project. It prioritizes the most vital activities and resources to keep the project on track and on schedule. One of the primary benefits of CCPM is that it helps to optimize project resources by identifying the key route and allocating resources to the most essential activities. This is particularly significant in a project like hotel building, when meeting the deadline is critical in order to be ready for the start of the tourist season. Furthermore, by employing buffers to account for uncertainty, CCPM helps to limit the possible dangers of delays. This may assist to guarantee that the project is completed on time, even if unforeseen delays or complications develop. Overall, the usage of CCPM in this project will aid in resource optimization and ensuring that the hotel is completed in time for the start of the tourist season, which is the primary goal of the project.
