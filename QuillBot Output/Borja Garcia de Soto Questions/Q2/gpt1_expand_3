For a project such as the building of a hotel on Yas Island, where the owner is particularly interested in having the hotel completed on time and full occupancy is anticipated, the approach of Critical Chain Project Management would be the most suitable resource management strategy to utilize (CCPM). The critical success factors of CCPM are as follows: It places a greater emphasis on the management of the resources (people, equipment, and materials) required to finish the project than it does on the management of the schedule alone. It does not depend on the "contingency" time that has been factored into the schedule; rather, it employs a "buffer" to account for the uncertainty and possible delays in the project. It assigns the highest level of importance to the most important activities and resources in order to guarantee that the project will proceed as planned and be completed on schedule. Identifying the critical path and making sure that resources are allocated to the tasks that are the most important are two of the primary benefits that come along with using CCPM. Another significant advantage of using CCPM is that it helps to optimize the resources that are being used on the project. This is of the utmost significance in a project such as the building of a hotel, in which it is essential to complete the work by the allotted time in order to be prepared for the beginning of the busy season of tourism. The use of buffers to accommodate for uncertainty is another way in which CCPM contributes to the reduction of possible risks that might result in delays. This may assist to guarantee that the project is completed on time, even if there are unanticipated delays or problems that come up during its completion. The application of CCPM to this project will, all things considered, make it easier to maximize the use of the available resources and bring the hotel up to speed in time for the beginning of the tourist season, which is the primary purpose of the project.
