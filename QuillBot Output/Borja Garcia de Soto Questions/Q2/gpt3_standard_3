The most suitable resource management approach would be the Critical Path Method for a construction project like the building of a hotel on Yas Island, where the owner is highly interested in having the hotel completed in time for the start of the tourist season and full occupancy is anticipated (CPM). A network diagram is used in the CPM project management method to show the project timetable. It is used to locate a project's critical path, which is the order of tasks that establishes the project's earliest deadline. CPM enables project managers to concentrate on the tasks that have the most influence on the project's completion date by identifying the critical route. The fact that CPM calculates the earliest start and end times for each activity using a forward pass and a backward pass is one of its key features. Project managers may then identify the important route and allocate resources appropriately. The ability for project managers to determine the float or slack time of each task is another feature of CPM. The length of time an activity may be postponed without affecting the completion of the whole project is known as the "float time." Project managers may then utilize this information to concentrate on the key path tasks and identify activities that can be postponed without causing the project to be delayed. By identifying the critical path and concentrating on the activities that have the greatest influence on the project's completion date in this situation, the use of CPM can help you optimize the project's resources. It can also make you aware of the slack time on activities so you can plan and use the resources more effectively.
