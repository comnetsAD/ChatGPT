Critical Chain Project Management would be the most suitable resource management strategy for a project such as the building of a hotel on Yas Island, where the owner is very concerned with the facility's on-time completion and full occupancy is anticipated (CCPM). CCPM focuses on managing the resources (people, equipment, and materials) required to accomplish the project, as opposed to just managing the schedule. Rather to depending on "contingency" time built into the plan, it employs a "buffer" to accommodate for uncertainty and unexpected delays in the project. It prioritizes the most important activities and resources to ensure the project remains on track and is completed on schedule. One of the primary benefits of CCPM is that it helps to optimize project resources by identifying the key route and allocating resources to the most essential activities. This is particularly critical in a project such as the building of a hotel, when meeting the deadline is vital in order to be ready for the beginning of the tourist season. Additionally, CCPM mitigates possible delay concerns by including buffers to account for uncertainty. This may assist guarantee that the project is completed on schedule, even if unforeseen delays or problems develop. Overall, the usage of CCPM in this project will assist to maximize the resources and guarantee that the hotel will be ready for the start of the tourist season, which is the project's primary purpose.
