The "Critical Path Method" would be the best resource management strategy for this project (CPM). CPM is a strategy for planning, scheduling, and controlling a project. It aids in identifying the critical route and important activities, which are those that, if delayed, would cause the project to be delayed. It also helps in calculating the float time for non-critical operations. CPM allows you to optimize project resources by concentrating on the critical route and ensuring that the appropriate resources are accessible when they are needed. CPM is ideal for this project since it allows for the identification of the most significant tasks and activities, which can then be prioritized in terms of resources and time. With the owner's focus on on-time completion, CPM may assist in identifying and mitigating possible delays, as well as optimizing resource allocation to guarantee that the project is finished on time. Furthermore, CPM's ability to predict float time for non-critical operations may aid in resource prioritization and guarantees that the project is finished on schedule and with little delay. In conclusion, the application of CPM in this project may maximize resource use and assist assure project completion on time, which is critical for the project's success given the owner's interests and the predicted full occupancy during the tourist season.
