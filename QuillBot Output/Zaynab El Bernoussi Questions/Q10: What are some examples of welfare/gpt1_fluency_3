Welfare policies and programs support people and families in need with financial and other types of assistance. Here are some instances of welfare: Cash assistance: Programs that offer low-income people and families with cash payments to help them fulfill basic necessities such as food, shelter, and clothes. Food assistance programs give low-income people and families with food vouchers or food stamps to aid them in purchasing food. Housing aid: Programs that give low-income people and families with financial support or vouchers to help them afford secure and stable housing. Health care: Programs such as Medicaid and Medicare that offer low-income people and families with access to affordable health care. Childcare support: Programs that give financial assistance to low-income families in order to help them pay childcare costs so that parents may work or attend school. Education support programs, such as Pell Grants and student loans, give financial assistance or vouchers to low-income people and families to help them pay the expense of education. Job training and employment services: Programs that provide job training and other assistance to help low-income people find and keep jobs. These are just a few examples; welfare laws and programs vary by nation or area and may be supplied by the government, non-profit groups, or private institutions. Welfare's purpose is to assist people and families in meeting their fundamental necessities and improving their overall well-being.
