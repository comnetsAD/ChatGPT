The providing of assistance and support to low-income people and families is what we mean when we talk about "welfare." The following are some examples of programs and services related to welfare: Help from the government can come in the form of programs like Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), which offers financial assistance to low-income families with children, and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), which offers food assistance to low-income individuals and families. Both of these programs fall under the category of public assistance. Health care: This includes programs such as Medicaid, which provides coverage for health care to low-income individuals and families, and the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which provides coverage for health care to children who come from low-income families. Also included in this category are programs such as Medicare and Tricare, which provide coverage for prescription drugs. Housing assistance includes programs such as Section 8 housing vouchers and public housing, both of which provide low-income individuals and families with rental assistance and affordable housing, respectively. Also included in this category is the provision of housing for homeless individuals and families. Education and training: This includes programs such as Head Start, which offers early childhood education and support services to low-income children and families, and Job Corps, which offers education and training to low-income youth. Both of these programs are aimed at helping people get the education and training they need to be successful in life. Social security: This refers to programs like as Social Security and Supplemental Security Income (SSI), which provide monetary help to those who are retired, handicapped, or unable to work for other reasons. Other social security programs include Medicare and Medicaid. These are some examples of different types of welfare programs; however, welfare laws and services may differ from nation to country, and they can also include other kinds of assistance such as benefits for people with disabilities, pensions, and unemployment.
