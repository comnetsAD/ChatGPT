The fall of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century AD is one example of a historical age of instability. There were many reasons for the Western Roman Empire's inability to adjust to changing situations. For starters, the empire was besieged by barbarian tribes like as the Visigoths, Huns, and Vandals. These tribes were able to cross the empire's frontiers and diminish its military might because they were typically more armed and organized than the Roman army. Furthermore, the empire's economy was founded on slavery, and slave revolts and a lack of slave labor undermined the empire even further. Second, the empire was beset by internal challenges such as political insecurity, economic difficulties, and a lack of effective leadership. These difficulties hampered the empire's ability to adjust to changing situations and successfully defend itself against foreign attacks. The empire was also beleaguered by over-expansion, which caused financial and administrative hardship, as well as a deterioration in moral and civic values among people and the soldiers. The incapacity of the Western Roman Empire to adapt to changing circumstances eventually led to its collapse and the fall of the Western Roman Empire.
