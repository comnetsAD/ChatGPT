The fall of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century AD is one instance of a chaotic period in history. The Western Roman Empire was unable to change with the times for a variety of reasons. First of all, barbarian tribes like the Visigoths, Huns, and Vandals often invaded the empire. These tribes were able to breach the limits of the empire and reduce its military might because they were often more prepared and organized than the Roman army. Slave revolts, a lack of available slave labor, and the fact that the empire's economy was built on slavery all contributed to the empire's decline. Second, the empire was also troubled by internal concerns including political unrest, economic difficulties, and a lack of effective leadership. These problems made it impossible for the empire to defend itself against outside attacks and adjust to changing circumstances. In addition to the financial and administrative hardship brought on by the empire's overexpansion, the military and civilian population's moral and civic values were deteriorating. The Western Roman Empire eventually collapsed and fell because it was unable to adapt to the changing environment.
