The fall of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century AD is one instance of a chaotic period in history. The Western Roman Empire was unable to change with the times for a variety of reasons. First, barbarian tribes often invaded and attacked the empire. These tribes were able to get past the empire's defenses and seriously harm both its people and infrastructure. The army of the empire, which had in the past successfully repelled invaders, was overworked and unable to adequately protect all of its frontiers. Second, there was a crisis in the empire's economy. Trade and commerce declined as a result of the depreciation of the empire's currency and the widespread inflation that followed. The empire's tax system was also unable to cover the expense of protecting its territory and maintaining its infrastructure, which made the economic crisis worse. These elements acting together caused the empire's capacity to uphold order to deteriorate, which eventually resulted in its fall. In conclusion, a combination of foreign invasions and internal economic and political causes that the Western Roman Empire was unable to adapt to and overcome caused the empire's demise.
