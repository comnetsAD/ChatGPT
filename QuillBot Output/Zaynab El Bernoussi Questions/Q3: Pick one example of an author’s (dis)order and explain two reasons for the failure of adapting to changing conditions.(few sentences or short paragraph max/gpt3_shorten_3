In the 5th century AD, the Western Roman Empire collapsed. The Western Roman Empire failed to adapt for several reasons. Barbarian tribes invaded the empire first. The empire's infrastructure and people suffered from these tribes' invasion. The empire's army, which had previously repelled invaders, was overstretched and couldn't protect all its frontiers. Second, the empire's economy collapsed. Trade and commerce declined due to the empire's debased currency and inflation. The empire's tax system couldn't cover the expense of protecting its territory and maintaining its infrastructure, contributing to the economic catastrophe. These circumstances caused the empire's order to weaken and fall. In conclusion, the Western Roman Empire collapsed owing to foreign invasions and internal economic and political issues that it could not adjust to.
