The fall of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century A.D. is an example of a disorderly period in history. There were several reasons why the Western Roman Empire was unable to adjust to changing situations. Initially, invasions and raids from barbarian tribes afflicted the empire. These tribes were able to penetrate the empire's frontiers and wreak severe harm to its people and infrastructure. The empire's army, which had previously been efficient at repelling invaders, was now overextended and unable to defend all of its frontiers successfully. The economy of the empire was also in peril. The debasement and excessive inflation of the empire's money led to a fall in trade and commerce. The inability of the empire's tax system to cover the expense of protecting its territory and maintaining its infrastructure also contributed to the economic catastrophe. The confluence of these circumstances resulted in a decrease in the empire's capacity to maintain order, which eventually led to its demise. The Western Roman Empire collapsed owing to a mix of foreign invasions and internal economic and political problems that it was unable to adjust to or overcome.
