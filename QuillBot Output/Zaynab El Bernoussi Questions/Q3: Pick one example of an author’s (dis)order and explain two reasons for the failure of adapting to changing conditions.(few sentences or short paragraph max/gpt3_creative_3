The disintegration of the Western Roman Empire during the fifth century AD is an example of a chaotic period in history. The inability of the Western Roman Empire to adjust to new circumstances was due to a multitude of factors. To begin, the empire was constantly being attacked and invaded by various barbaric groups. These tribes broke through the empire's defenses and decimated its people and economy. Despite the empire's army's track record of success in fending off invasions, it was now stretched too thin to provide adequate protection for all of its borders. A second problem was the state of the empire's economy. Trade and commerce suffered as a result of debased coinage and widespread inflation across the empire. The economic problem was exacerbated by the fact that the tax system of the empire was inadequate to cover the costs of protecting its territory and maintaining its infrastructure. The decrease in the empire's capacity to maintain order, brought on by all of these circumstances, led to the empire's final demise. Invasion from the outside and internal economic and political causes that the Western Roman Empire was unable to adapt to and overcome ultimately led to its downfall.
