The disintegration of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century A.D. is a good illustration of a period in history that was marked by anarchy. There were many other factors that contributed to the Western Roman Empire's inability to adjust to the shifting environmental circumstances. In the beginning, the empire was continuously harassed by incursions and assaults from various barbarian tribes. These tribes were successful in penetrating the frontiers of the empire and inflicting tremendous harm upon both its people and its infrastructure. The army of the empire, which had in the past been successful in fending off invasions, was stretched too thin and was unable to defend all of its frontiers in an efficient manner. Second, the economy of the empire was likewise in a state of distress. The money of the empire became worthless, and inflation was prevalent, both of which contributed to a fall in commercial activity. The tax system of the empire was inadequate to cover the costs of protecting its territory and maintaining its infrastructure, which was another factor that contributed to the economic crisis that the empire was experiencing. The accumulation of these challenges resulted in a deterioration of the empire's capacity to preserve order, which in turn led to the disintegration of the empire. In conclusion, the fall of the Western Roman Empire was brought on by a confluence of causes, including invasions from the outside as well as internal economic and political challenges that the empire was unable to adapt to or overcome.
