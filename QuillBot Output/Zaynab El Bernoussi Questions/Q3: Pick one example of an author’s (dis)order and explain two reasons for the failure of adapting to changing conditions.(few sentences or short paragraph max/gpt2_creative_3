The disintegration of the Western Roman Empire during the fifth century AD is an example of a chaotic period in history. The inability of the Western Roman Empire to adjust to new circumstances was due to a multitude of factors. Invasion after invasion by barbarian peoples like the Visigoths, Huns, and Vandals afflicted the empire. These tribes were able to breach Roman defenses because they were more armed and better organized than the Roman army. Moreover, slave revolts and a lack of slave labor severely undermined the empire since its economy relied on slave labor. Second, the empire had its own challenges inside, like as political and economic instability and weak leadership. All of these problems hindered the empire's ability to respond to shifting circumstances and protect itself from outside danger. Overexpansion had put a burden on the empire's resources and administration, and it had also contributed to a fall in civic and moral values among the populace and the armed forces. Because of its inability to adjust to new circumstances, the Western Roman Empire eventually fell.
