The disintegration of the Western Roman Empire during the fifth century AD is an example of a chaotic period in history. The inability of the Western Roman Empire to adjust to new circumstances was due to a multitude of factors. An rising number of barbarian invasions by Germanic tribes like the Visigoths, Ostrogoths, and Vandals was the first major threat to the empire. Due to ineffective border defense, the empire lost land and resources. Second, the empire suffered from a lack of decisive leadership and a weakened internal political system. Constant emperor turnover, military coups, and the emergence of strong military commanders who sometimes went their own way marked this period. Political instability hindered the empire's capacity to successfully react to foreign challenges and to sustain its unity. The decline of the Western Roman Empire was exacerbated by the state of the empire's economy and society. The taxing system was too complicated, leading to a concentration of wealth among a few elite and a massive public debt for the empire. The empire's administrative and political instability made it hard for it to meet these difficulties as well. The failure of the Western Roman Empire to adequately adapt to a variety of military, political, economic, and social obstacles led to the empire's eventual decline and fall.
