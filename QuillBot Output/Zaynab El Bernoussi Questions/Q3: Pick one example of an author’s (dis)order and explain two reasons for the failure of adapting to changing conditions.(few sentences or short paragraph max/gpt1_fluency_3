The fall of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century AD is one example of a historical age of instability. There were many reasons for the Western Roman Empire's inability to adjust to changing situations. For starters, the empire faced a rising number of barbarian invasions from Germanic tribes including the Visigoths, Ostrogoths, and Vandals. The military of the empire was unable to adequately defend its frontiers, resulting in the loss of land and resources. Second, the empire suffered from internal political insecurity and a lack of effective leadership. This era marked by frequent emperor changes, military coups, and the growth of strong military chiefs who often acted independently of the civilian authority. This lack of governmental stability made it impossible for the empire to react effectively to foreign challenges and sustain imperial cohesiveness. Furthermore, the empire's economic and social problems contributed to the fall of the Western Roman Empire. A complicated taxing system, a large public debt, and the concentration of wealth in the hands of a few weighed heavily on the empire. The empire's administrative and political instability made it difficult to solve these concerns as well. Overall, the Western Roman Empire fell owing to a confluence of causes, including military, political, economic, and social obstacles that the empire was unable to properly adjust to.
