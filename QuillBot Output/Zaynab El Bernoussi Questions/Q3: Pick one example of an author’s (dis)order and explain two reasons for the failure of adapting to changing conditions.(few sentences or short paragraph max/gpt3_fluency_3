The fall of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century AD is one example of a historical age of instability. There were many reasons for the Western Roman Empire's inability to adjust to changing situations. For starters, the empire was besieged and attacked by barbarian tribes. These tribes were successful in breaching the empire's frontiers and wreaking havoc on its infrastructure and inhabitants. The empire's army, which had previously been successful in repelling invaders, was overstretched and unable to properly defend all of its frontiers. Second, the empire's economy was in disarray. The empire's currency was debased, and inflation was prevalent, causing trade and commerce to suffer. Furthermore, the empire's tax system was insufficient to fund the costs of defending its territory and maintaining its infrastructure, contributing to the economic catastrophe. The confluence of these circumstances weakened the empire's capacity to maintain order, eventually leading to its demise. In summary, the Western Roman Empire collapsed as a result of a mix of foreign invasions and internal economic and political problems that the empire was unable to adapt to and overcome.
