In the 5th century AD, the Western Roman Empire collapsed. The Western Roman Empire failed to adapt for several reasons. First, Visigoths, Huns, and Vandals raided the empire. These tribes, typically more armed and organized than the Roman army, penetrated the empire's frontiers and weakened it. Slave revolts and labor shortages crippled the empire, which relied on slavery. Second, political instability, economic concerns, and weak leadership afflicted the empire. The empire struggled to adapt and protect itself due to these challenges. Over-expansion caused financial and administrative hardship and a deterioration in moral and civic values among civilians and the military. Failure to adapt to changing circumstances caused the Western Roman Empire's demise.
