The fall of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century A.D. is an example of a disorderly period in history. There were several reasons why the Western Roman Empire was unable to adjust to changing situations. First, the empire was afflicted by invasions by Visigoths, Huns, and Vandals, among other barbarian groups. These tribes, who were often more armed and organized than the Roman army, were able to breach the empire's frontiers and reduce its military might. In addition, the economy of the empire was founded on slavery, and slave revolts and a lack of slave labor further undermined it. The empire was also beset by internal challenges, including as political instability, economic difficulties, and a lack of strong leadership. The empire also suffered from overexpansion, which led to financial and administrative hardship, as well as a decrease in the moral and civic values of its civilians and military personnel. The incapacity of the Western Roman Empire to adapt to changing situations led to its eventual demise and the fall of the Western Roman Empire.
