The disintegration of the Western Roman Empire in the fifth century A.D. is a good illustration of a period in history that was marked by anarchy. There were many other factors that contributed to the Western Roman Empire's inability to adjust to the shifting environmental circumstances. In the beginning, the empire was beset by invasions by barbarian tribes such as Visigoths, Huns, and Vandals. These invaders wreaked havoc on the empire. These tribes, who were often more armed and organized than the Roman army, were able to break through the empire's frontiers, which in turn weakened the empire's military might. In addition, the economy of the empire was dependent on slave labor; hence, the empire was further damaged by slave revolts and a lack of available slave labor. Second, the empire was beset by challenges from inside, including as political instability, economic difficulties, and a dearth of good leadership. Because of these problems, it was difficult for the empire to adjust to shifting circumstances and to adequately defend itself against foreign dangers. In addition to these problems, the overextension of the empire was putting a burden on its finances and administration, and it was also contributing to a general deterioration in moral and civic values among both civilians and military personnel. The inability of the Western Roman Empire to adjust to the changing circumstances eventually led to the collapse of the Western Roman Empire, which in turn led to the fall of the Roman Empire.
