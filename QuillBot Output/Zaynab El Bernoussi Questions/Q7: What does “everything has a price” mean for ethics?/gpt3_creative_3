There are a number of potential ethical implications of the adage "everything has a price." One approach is that when things are given a monetary value, people and institutions may be tempted to put it ahead of other important values, including ethics and morals. Corruption, exploitation, and market manipulation are all problems that might arise as a result, all of which have the potential to negatively affect society. This concept also has the potential to result in the commercialization of items and services that were previously not considered to have monetary worth. This may lead to the degeneration of ideals and values that are at odds with the dictates of the marketplace. The sale of human organs on the open market, for instance, raises ethical concerns since it might lead to the exploitation of vulnerable people and widen the gap between the wealthy and the poor. A culture of consumerism, in which individuals are pushed to buy things and services despite the potential negative moral or ethical consequences of doing so, may also result when everything is reduced to a price. Individuals and communities may suffer as a consequence of a failure to address the harmful effects of this trend on our social and natural environments. Because everything has a price, there is sometimes a conflict between doing what is right and doing what will make money. Individuals and businesses should think about the moral and ethical repercussions of their conduct and strike a balance between financial success and doing the right thing.
