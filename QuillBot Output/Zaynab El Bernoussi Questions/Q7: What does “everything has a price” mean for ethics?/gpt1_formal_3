The concept that "everything has a price" has several ethical implications. One approach is by fostering the belief that everything, including products, services, and even people, can be purchased and sold. This may result in the commercialization of items usually considered to have intrinsic worth, such as human life, dignity, and intimate relationships. This may also lead to a consumerist society in which individuals feel they can purchase pleasure, love, and even morality. This concept may also foster a feeling of moral relativism, in which the worth of an object is judged simply by its market value and not by any intrinsic moral value. This may cause individuals to be ready to compromise their moral beliefs for financial gain. Furthermore, the belief that "everything has a price" may lead to the exploitation of vulnerable populations, such as the impoverished, immigrants, and those with restricted access to resources. This may lead to circumstances in which fundamental human rights are not respected and the most vulnerable members of society are exploited. Many things, such as human life, dignity, social interactions, and the natural environment, have an inherent worth that must be maintained and cherished. Ethical theories such as deontology, virtue ethics, and consequentialism argue that moral principles should drive our acts and choices regardless of the monetary consequences.
