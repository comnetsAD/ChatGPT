"Everything has a price" has numerous ethical implications. It can teach individuals to buy and sell anything, even people. This may commodify human existence, dignity, and intimate connections. This may also promote consumerism, where individuals think they can purchase happiness, love, and virtue. This notion may also lead to moral relativism, when market value determines value rather than morality. This may lead to moral compromise for financial benefit. "Everything has a price" may also exploit vulnerable populations including the impoverished, immigrants, and the resource-poor. This may lead to fundamental human rights violations and exploitation of the most vulnerable. Human life, dignity, social interactions, and the natural environment have inherent worth and should be maintained and cherished. Deontology, virtue ethics, and consequentialism argue that morality should govern our behavior regardless of financial consequences.
