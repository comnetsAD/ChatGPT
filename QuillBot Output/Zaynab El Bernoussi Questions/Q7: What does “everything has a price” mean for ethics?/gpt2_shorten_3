"Everything has a price" has numerous ethical implications. When things have a monetary value, it might encourage people and organizations to put money above ethics or morality. This may cause individuals or organizations to make choices that benefit themselves but hurt others. This approach may also commodify previously unvalued items and services. This might privatize healthcare, education, and natural resources. This may deprive low-income people of these products and services and profiteer from them. Everything having a price may likewise devalue various parts of human existence and experiences. It may create a market for human organs or surrogacy, which undermines human dignity and autonomy. Ethically, not everything should be priced. Human life, dignity, and the environment have moral worth beyond money. This suggests that society should make choices based on morality, not financial gain.
