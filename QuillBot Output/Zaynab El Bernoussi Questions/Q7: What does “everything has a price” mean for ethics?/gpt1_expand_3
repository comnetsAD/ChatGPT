There are a number of potential ethical implications of the adage "everything has a price." By normalizing the idea that everything and everything, including other people, may be exchanged for money, it can alter people's worldviews in many ways. Human life, individual dignity, and interpersonal connections are just a few examples of the kinds of things that may be reduced to monetary worth in such a world. As a result, individuals may start to assume that they can purchase their way to a better life by accumulating material possessions. Another potential fallout from this line of thinking is the rise of a market-based moral relativism in which monetary value supersedes all other considerations when assessing something's worth. As a result, some individuals may be tempted to put their morals to the side for the sake of financial gain. The poor, immigrants, and those with little means may be targeted for exploitation because of the belief that "everything has a price." This may lead to situations where the most defenseless members of society are exploited and fundamental human rights are violated. Many things, including human life, dignity, social interactions, and the natural environment, have an inherent worth and should be maintained and valued regardless of their market value. Many ethical systems, including deontology, virtue ethics, and consequentialism, argue that moral principles, rather than financial considerations, should be the basis for our actions and choices.
