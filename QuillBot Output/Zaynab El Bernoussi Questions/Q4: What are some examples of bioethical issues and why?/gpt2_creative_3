When anything involving the care of living beings, or the use of technological solutions to health problems, raises ethical concerns, we say that it is a bioethical issue. Included in this list of bioethical concerns are: Concerns have been raised concerning the morality of using human genetic engineering to create "designer babies" and the possible repercussions of such an endeavor for society. Concerns surrounding euthanasia, or the deliberate termination of a human life, center on the ethics of killing and the right of the dying to choose how they want to die. There are ethical and societal concerns regarding cloning since it allows for the creation of genetically identical replicas of animals and maybe humans. Concerns have been raised concerning the ethics of using animals for scientific study and testing, as well as the care of captive animals. Concerns regarding the morality of uneven access to health care and the ethics of allocating scarce resources arise when discussing the distribution of medical resources. Concerns have been raised concerning the use of AI in medical decision-making, including the possibility for bias and inaccuracies in AI-driven choices, and whether or not it is ethical to place such trust in computers rather than humans. Although these are only a few instances, bioethical concerns may take many forms and vary widely depending on historical circumstances, scientific understanding, and cultural norms. They prompt serious reflection on such fundamental issues as the meaning of human existence, the function of science, and the principles that ought to guide social organization.
