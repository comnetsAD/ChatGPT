Bioethical concerns pertain to the application of ethical concepts to biology and medicine. The following are instances of bioethical issues: The capacity to change and test for genetic features raises ethical considerations regarding the consequences of this technology for people, families, and society. The use of embryonic stem cells in research raises ethical concerns about the moral position of the embryo and the possibility for the study to lead to the development of human clones. The capability of cloning to produce genetically identical replicas of organisms raises ethical concerns about the consequences of this technology for reproduction and the notion of human identity. Euthanasia and assisted suicide pose ethical problems about the sanctity of life and the right to die with respect. Human experimentation: The use of human beings in research involves ethical concerns about the rights and welfare of study participants, as well as the possibility of abuse. These issues are considered bioethical because they involve the application of ethical principles to the fields of biology and medicine and raise questions about the responsibilities of scientists, healthcare professionals, and society as a whole with regard to the use of new technologies and the protection of human life and well-being.
