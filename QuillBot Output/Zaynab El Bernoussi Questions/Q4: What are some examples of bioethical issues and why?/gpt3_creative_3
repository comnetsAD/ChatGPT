What we call "bioethical dilemmas" are those that arise when we try to apply general ethical standards to specific problems in biology and medicine. Included in this list of bioethical concerns are: The capacity to change and test for genetic features raises ethical problems regarding the consequences of this technology for individuals, families, and society at large via the fields of genetic engineering and genetic testing. Stem cell research: using embryos as study subjects raises moral concerns regarding the potential for the practice to lead to the development of human clones and the value of the embryo itself. Concerns regarding the morality of cloning stem from the fact that it is now possible to generate genetically identical duplicates of creatures, which has broad ramifications for reproduction and the very nature of human identity. There are moral problems surrounding euthanasia and assisted suicide since they involve the intentional termination of a human life. Concerns concerning the rights and wellbeing of study participants and the possibility of abuse arise when humans are used as experimental subjects. Because they concern the application of ethical principles to the field of biology and medicine, and because they raise questions about the responsibilities of scientists, healthcare professionals, and society at large in the use of new technologies to protect human life and welfare, these problems are classified as bioethical issues.
