Concerns that pertain to the application of ethical concepts to the fields of biology and medicine are referred to as being of a bioethical nature. The following are some instances of problems with bioethics: Genetic engineering and genetic testing: The ability to manipulate and test for genetic traits raises ethical questions about the implications of this technology for individuals, families, and society as a whole. Genetic engineering can be defined as the process of adding, removing, or modifying genetic material. Stem cell research: the use of embryonic stem cells in research raises ethical questions about the moral status of the embryo and the potential for the research to lead to the creation of human clones. These questions are raised because of the potential for the research to lead to the creation of human clones. The capacity to generate duplicates of creatures that are genetically identical raises ethical problems regarding the consequences of this technology for reproduction and the meaning of human identity. Cloning is one example of this. The purposeful termination of a person's life, such as in the cases of euthanasia and assisted suicide, raises ethical problems about the sanctity of life and the right to die with dignity. Experimenting on humans raises ethical concerns about the rights and welfare of research participants, as well as the possibility of mistreating study volunteers. Because they involve the application of ethical principles to the fields of biology and medicine, and because they raise questions about the responsibilities of scientists, healthcare professionals, and society as a whole in the use of new technologies and the protection of human life and welfare, these issues are regarded as being bioethical issues.
