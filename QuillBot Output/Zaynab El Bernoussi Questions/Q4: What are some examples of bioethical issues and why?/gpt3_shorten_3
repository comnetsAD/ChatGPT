Bioethical concerns apply ethics to biology and medicine. Bioethical problems include: Genetic engineering and genetic testing: The potential to change and test genetic features creates ethical concerns for individuals, families, and society. Stem cell research: Embryonic stem cell research raises ethical problems concerning the embryo's morality and the possibility of human cloning. Cloning: Creating genetically identical duplicates of organisms poses ethical problems regarding reproduction and human identity. Euthanasia and assisted suicide pose ethical problems regarding life's sacredness and the right to die with dignity. Human experimentation: Researching humans raises ethical concerns about their rights and wellbeing and the possibility for abuse. These concerns are bioethical because they apply ethical ideas to biology and medicine and raise questions about the obligations of scientists, healthcare practitioners, and society to employ new technology and safeguard human life and welfare.
