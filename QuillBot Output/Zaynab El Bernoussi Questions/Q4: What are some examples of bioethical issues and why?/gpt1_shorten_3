Biology and medicine provide bioethical challenges. Examples: Cloning: The morality of making identical duplicates of living things, especially human clones for medical study or reproduction. Genetic engineering: The use of technology to change creatures' genetic composition raises worries about hazards, unforeseen effects, and ethical problems relating to eugenics and genetic modification. Artificial intelligence in medicine: The use of AI in diagnoses, therapy, and research raises ethical concerns concerning the doctor-patient relationship, prejudice, mistakes, and privacy and autonomy. Stem cell research: The use of embryonic stem cells for medical study and therapy raises ethical problems concerning their source, the possibility for human-animal hybrids, and human cloning. Human experimentation: Medical research involving vulnerable people, informed permission, and risks and rewards raises ethical concerns. These are only a few bioethical challenges, but they all pose moral considerations concerning technological usage and human dignity and rights.
