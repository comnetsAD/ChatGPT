The application of ethical standards to the study of biology and medicine is known as bioethical concerns. Several instances of bioethical concerns include: Genetic testing and genetic engineering: The capacity to change genetic characteristics and conduct genetic tests raises moral concerns about the effects of this technology on people, families, and society at large. Stem cell research: Using embryonic stem cells for research raises moral concerns regarding the embryo's position as well as the possibility that the study may result in the production of human clones. Cloning: The potential to produce creatures that are genetically similar to one another raises ethical concerns about how this technology can affect how humans reproduce and define their identities. The purposeful taking of a person's life raises ethical concerns regarding the sanctity of life and the right to die with dignity. This includes euthanasia and assisted suicide. The use of human subjects in research raises moral concerns regarding the welfare and rights of study participants as well as the possibility of abuse. These issues are regarded as bioethical because they call into question the duties of scientists, medical professionals, and society at large in the use of cutting-edge technologies and the protection of human life and welfare. They also involve the application of ethical principles to the fields of biology and medicine.
