Peer assessment is a technique for rating student work or performance that involves asking peers to comment on and evaluate the work. This may be accomplished via formal or informal techniques, such as verbal or written feedback, rubrics, or written assessments. Peer evaluation may be applied in many different contexts, including group projects, the classroom, and online learning environments. Numerous advantages of peer evaluation include: promoting participation and active learning giving students a chance to provide and receive comments allowing students to analyze one other's work in a manner that is more impartial and trustworthy than teacher-only evaluation fostering in pupils the development of assessment and critical thinking abilities presenting a different viewpoint on the work of the students fostering a feeling of responsibility and ownership among pupils for their own learning To guarantee that the assessments are fair and accurate, peer assessment should be utilized as a supplement to teacher evaluation. It should also be well-designed, well-implemented, and well-supervised. Additionally, it's crucial to provide students the right instruction and direction on how to do peer evaluations in a courteous and efficient way.
