Peer-assessment is a way of assessing a student's work or performance by soliciting comments and review from their peers. This may be accomplished through official or informal means such as written assessments, rubrics, or verbal feedback. Peer evaluation may be applied in a number of situations, including the classroom, group projects, and online learning environments. Peer evaluation has many advantages, including: Promoting active learning and participation Giving students the chance to provide and receive comments Allowing students to evaluate their classmates' work in a more objective and trustworthy manner than teacher-only evaluation assisting pupils in developing critical thinking and evaluative abilities Providing an alternate viewpoint on a student's work Providing children with a feeling of ownership and accountability for their own learning However, it is vital to emphasize that peer-assessment should be used as a supplement to teacher evaluation, and it should be well-designed, well-implemented, and well-supervised to guarantee fair and accurate ratings. Furthermore, it is critical to offer students with the necessary training and advice on how to perform successful and polite peer evaluations.
