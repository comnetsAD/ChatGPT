Peer evaluation involves peer review and feedback. This might involve assessing classmates, coworkers, and other group members. Peer evaluation may be used in schools and workplaces to evaluate peers' work. Self-evaluation and direct assessment are two ways to peer appraise. Written, verbal, and numerical assessments may also be used. Peer-assessment aims to enhance work quality by offering constructive comments and helping people understand their strengths and weaknesses. It may also foster peer cooperation, accountability, and understanding and help people take ownership of their work.
