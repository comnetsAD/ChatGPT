This may be done formally or informally, with or without the use of rubrics or other checklists, and via the provision of either written or spoken assessments or comments. The classroom, the group project, and the online learning environment are just a few examples of places where peer evaluation is applied. There are a variety of upsides to relying on peer reviews, such as: Promoting lively participation and stimulating thought By allowing for student-to-student feedback exchanges Having students judge one another's work is more objective and dependable than relying on instructor evaluation alone.
