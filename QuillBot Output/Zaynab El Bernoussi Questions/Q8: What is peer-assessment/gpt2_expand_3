The practice of evaluating and providing comments on the work that has been completed by one's peers is referred to as peer evaluation. In this context, "grading the work of students, coworkers, or other persons within a group or organization" might mean anything from giving constructive criticism to providing praise. It is possible to use peer assessment in a variety of settings, including education and the workplace. In education, students may be asked to evaluate the work of their fellow students, and in the workplace, employees may be asked to provide feedback on the work of their colleagues. Peer assessment can be used in a variety of settings. Self-evaluation, in which people review their own work, is one kind of peer assessment. Direct assessment, in which individuals evaluate the work of others, is another form of peer assessment. Peer assessment may take many various forms. This may also be accomplished via the use of a variety of other ways, such as numerical ratings, vocal feedback, or written assessments. The primary purpose of peer evaluation is to offer feedback that may help enhance the quality of work. This is accomplished by giving feedback that is constructive and by assisting people in identifying their strengths as well as areas in which they can improve. In addition, it may be used to encourage cooperation, accountability, and mutual understanding among peers, in addition to assisting people in developing a feeling of ownership and responsibility for the work that they do.
