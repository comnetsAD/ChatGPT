Students analyze and critique the work of their peers in a process known as peer evaluation. This may occur in many different contexts, including classroom lectures, online classes, and collaborative projects. Students may improve their own comprehension of the content by evaluating the work of their peers in a peer evaluation, making this style of assessment useful for learning. Further, it aids in the growth of pupils' capacity for analysis, expression, and collaboration. In peer evaluation, students evaluate one another's work in a variety of methods, including by awarding grades, offering written comments, engaging in face-to-face conversation, and using technological resources like online tools. The process may be open and student-driven, or the instructor might provide structure and guidance. Papers, presentations, projects, and even tests may all benefit from peer review. Students benefit from peer evaluation because it helps them learn to think critically, communicate well, and work together effectively. It's a great way for educators to get constructive criticism on how they're doing as instructors and hear from students about what they're learning.
