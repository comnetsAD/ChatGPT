Peer evaluation is the practice of evaluating and providing comments on the work of one's peers. This may include assessing the work of students, coworkers, and other members of a group or organization. Peer evaluation is applicable in a range of contexts, such as in education, where students may be requested to evaluate the work of their classmates, and in the workplace, where workers may be asked to offer comments on the work of colleagues. Self-evaluation, in which people review their own work, and direct assessment, in which persons evaluate the work of others, are two kinds of peer assessment. It may also be accomplished via many techniques, including written reviews, verbal comments, and quantitative ratings. Peer evaluation aims to enhance the quality of work by offering constructive comments and assisting people in identifying their strengths and development opportunities. In addition, it may be used to foster peer cooperation, accountability, and mutual understanding, and to assist people build a feeling of ownership and responsibility for their work.
