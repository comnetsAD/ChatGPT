Peer evaluation is a procedure in which people analyze one other's work and provide comments. This may include assessing the work of coworkers, students, or other members of a team or organization. Peer evaluation may be utilized in a number of contexts, including education, where students may be requested to review the work of their classmates, or the workplace, where staff members may be asked to comment on one another's work. Peer evaluation may take many various forms, such as self-evaluation, in which people review their own work, or direct evaluation, in which people assess the work of others. Additionally, it may be done in a variety of ways, including via written assessments, vocal criticism, and numerical ratings. Peer assessment's major goal is to provide constructive criticism and assist people in identifying their areas of strength and development so that the quality of their work may be improved. It may also be used to encourage peer cooperation, accountability, and understanding as well as to aid people in taking ownership of and responsibility for their work.
