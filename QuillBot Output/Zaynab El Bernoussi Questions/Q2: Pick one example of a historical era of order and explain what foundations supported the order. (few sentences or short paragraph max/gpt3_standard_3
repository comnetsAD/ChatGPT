The Pax Romana, which was a time of comparatively calm and stability across the Roman Empire and lasted from 27 BC to 180 AD, is one example of a historical age of order. Strong central government, an organized and well-trained military, and a set of laws and institutions that permitted effective rule across the empire served as the cornerstones of this order. The creation of a shared culture and language, as well as infrastructure like roads and communication networks that allowed commerce and the movement of people and products across the empire, all contributed to the Pax Romana. The Roman Republic and Roman Empire's capacity to take over and rule over new lands and to maintain a system of rule and administration in those lands was also essential to the Pax Romana's survival.
