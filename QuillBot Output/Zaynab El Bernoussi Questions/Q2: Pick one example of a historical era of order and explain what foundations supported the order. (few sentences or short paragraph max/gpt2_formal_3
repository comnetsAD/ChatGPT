Pax Romana, a time of relative peace and stability in the Roman Empire that lasted from 27 BCE to 180 CE, is an example of a historical age of order. The Roman military, which was one of the most powerful and well-organized in the world at the time, largely maintained the Pax Romana. Allowing for relative peace and stability, the Roman army was able to retain control over the empire's enormous domains and suppress rebellions and invasions. The Roman legal system, which gave a feeling of justice and order and was founded on the rule of law, also contributed to the Pax Romana. The Roman government also instituted a policy of religious tolerance, which contributed to the establishment of unity and order among the empire's varied people.
