From 27 BC until 180 AD, the Roman Empire enjoyed relative peace and stability under the Pax Romana. A powerful central government, a well-trained military, and a set of laws and institutions that enabled effective empire administration maintained this order. A similar culture, language, and infrastructure including roads and communication networks enabled the Pax Romana. The Roman Republic and Roman Empire's capacity to acquire and rule lands and establish a system of government and administration in those areas sustained the Pax Romana.
