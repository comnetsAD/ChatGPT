The Pax Romana, which was a time of comparatively calm and stability in the Roman Empire from 27 BCE to 180 CE, is one example of a historical age of order. The Roman military, one of the most powerful and well-organized in the world at the time, was the main supporter of the Pax Romana. Relative peace and stability were made possible by the Roman army's capacity to retain control over the empire's vast lands and put down invasions and uprisings. The Pax Romana was also aided by the Roman legal system, which was founded on the rule of law and offered a feeling of justice and order. Additionally, the Roman government enacted a policy of religious tolerance, which aided in unifying and establishing order among the varied populace of the empire.
