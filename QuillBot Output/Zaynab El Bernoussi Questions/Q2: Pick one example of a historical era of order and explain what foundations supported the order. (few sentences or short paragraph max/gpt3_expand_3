The Pax Romana was a time of relative peace and stability across the Roman Empire that lasted from 27 BC to 180 AD. This era of order in history serves as an example since it lasted for the whole of the Roman Empire. A powerful centralized government, a well-trained and organized military, and a system of laws and institutions that allowed for the effective administration of the empire served as the foundations upon which this order was built. In addition, the establishment of a common culture and language, as well as the development of infrastructure such as roads and communication systems, which facilitated trade and the movement of people and goods throughout the empire, were all factors that contributed to the maintenance of the Pax Romana. The Roman Republic and Roman Empire's ability to conquer and control territories, as well as to establish and maintain a system of governance and administration in those territories, was essential to the preservation of the Pax Romana and ensured that it could continue for centuries after its establishment.
