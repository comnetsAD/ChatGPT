The Pax Romana, which lasted from 27 BC all the way up to 180 AD, is a good example of an orderly period in history. The Pax Romana, which literally translates to "Roman peace," was a period of time during which the Roman Empire was characterized by a relatively high level of peace and stability. A mix of military might, political steadiness, and competent administration served as the pillars upon which the order was built throughout this era. The Roman army was able to keep control of the situation and put down any uprisings that occurred, and the Roman government was successful in establishing a stable and centralized administration. In addition, the Roman legal system contributed to the preservation of order by delivering a stable body of legislation as well as a justification structure. The construction of roads, aqueducts, and other forms of infrastructure throughout the Roman Empire, which enabled communication and commerce, was another factor that contributed to the maintenance of the Pax Romana.
