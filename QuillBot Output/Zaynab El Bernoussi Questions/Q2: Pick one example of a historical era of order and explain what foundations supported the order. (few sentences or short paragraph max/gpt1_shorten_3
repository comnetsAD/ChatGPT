The Pax Romana, from 27 BC to 180 AD, was an orderly period. The Roman Empire enjoyed relative peace and stability during the Pax Romana. The order was sustained by military strength, political stability, and effective administration. The Roman army controlled rebellions and the government established a stable, organized administration. By providing uniform rules and justice, the Roman judicial system maintained order. Roads, aqueducts, and other infrastructure helped the empire communicate and trade, supporting the Pax Romana.
