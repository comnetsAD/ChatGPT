The Pax Romana, a time of relative peace and stability across the Roman Empire that lasted from 27 BC to 180 AD, is one example of a historical age of order. A powerful central government, a well-trained and organized military, and a set of laws and institutions that allowed for the empire's effective administration were the pillars that underpinned this order. Furthermore, the Pax Romana was fostered by the construction of infrastructure like as roads and communication networks that allowed commerce and the movement of people and products across the empire. The Pax Romana also depended on the capacity of the Roman Republic and Roman Empire to acquire and dominate areas, as well as to maintain a system of government and administration in those provinces, to ensure the continuation of the Pax Romana.
