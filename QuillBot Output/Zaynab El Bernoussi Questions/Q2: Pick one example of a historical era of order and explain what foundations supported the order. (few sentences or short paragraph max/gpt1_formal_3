Pax Romana, which lasted from 27 B.C. to 180 A.D., is an example of an orderly age in history. The Pax Romana, which literally translates to "Roman peace," was a time of relative peace and stability across the Roman Empire. The order at this period was upheld by a mix of military might, political stability, and effective administration. The Roman army was able to maintain order and suppress rebellions, while the Roman government established a stable and unified administration. In addition to maintaining order, the Roman legal system provided a coherent set of rules and a system of justice. The development of roads, aqueducts, and other infrastructure benefited the Pax Romana by facilitating communication and commerce across the empire.
