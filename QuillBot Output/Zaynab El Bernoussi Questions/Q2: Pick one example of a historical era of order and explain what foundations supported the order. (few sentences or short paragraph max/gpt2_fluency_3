The Pax Romana, a time of relative peace and stability in the Roman Empire that lasted from 27 BCE to 180 CE, is one example of a historical age of order. The Roman military, which was one of the most powerful and well-organized in the world at the time, was the primary supporter of the Pax Romana. The Roman army was able to keep control of the empire's enormous lands and quash rebellions and invasions, resulting in relative peace and stability. Furthermore, the Roman legal system, which was founded on the rule of law and created a feeling of fairness and order, aided the Pax Romana. The Roman government also instituted a policy of religious tolerance, which aided in the creation of a feeling of unity and order among the empire's varied people.
