The Pax Romana was a time of relative peace and stability in the Roman Empire that lasted from 27 BCE to 180 CE. This era of order in history serves as an example since it lasted for such a long period of time (from 27 BCE to 180 CE). The Roman military, which at the time was one of the most powerful and well-organized armies in the world, was the primary pillar upon which the Pax Romana was founded and maintained. Because the Roman army was able to retain control over the vast areas of the empire and put down uprisings as well as invasions, the empire was able to enjoy a degree of peace and stability. The Roman judicial system, which was founded on the concept of the rule of law and offered a feeling of both justice and order, was another factor that led to the development of the Pax Romana. A policy of religious tolerance was also followed by the Roman government, which contributed to the development of a feeling of unity and order among the very different people who lived inside the Roman empire.
