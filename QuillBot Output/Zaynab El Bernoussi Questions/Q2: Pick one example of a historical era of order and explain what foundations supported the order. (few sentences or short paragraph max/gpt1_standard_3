The Pax Romana, which lasted from 27 BC to 180 AD, is one instance of a period of order in history. The Roman Empire had a time of comparatively calm and stability known as the Pax Romana, or "Roman peace." During this period, the order was based on a mix of military might, political stability, and effective governance. The Roman government was able to set up a reliable and organized administration, and the Roman army was successful in maintaining order and putting down uprisings. By establishing a coherent set of rules and a system of justice, the Roman legal system further contributed to the preservation of order. The building of roads, aqueducts, and other infrastructure helped to promote the Pax Romana by facilitating communication and commerce over the whole empire.
