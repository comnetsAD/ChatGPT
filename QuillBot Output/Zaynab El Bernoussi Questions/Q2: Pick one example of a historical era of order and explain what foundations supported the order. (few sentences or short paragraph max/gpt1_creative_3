The Pax Romana, which existed from 27 B.C.E. to 180 C.E., is a good historical example of a time of peace and stability. Pax Romana, or "Roman peace," was a time when the Roman Empire was generally at peace with itself and its neighbors. It was a period when the order was based on a solid foundation of military might, political stability, and competent leadership. The Roman military effectively suppressed uprisings, and the Roman government established a dependable, unified system of rule. Moreover, the Roman legal system aided in maintaining order by providing a uniform set of rules and an established system of justice. The development of the Roman Empire's transportation network, including roads, aqueducts, and other infrastructure, contributed to the Pax Romana by opening up previously inaccessible markets and connecting previously isolated regions.
