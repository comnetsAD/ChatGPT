The Pax Romana, which lasted from 27 BC to 180 AD, is one example of a historical age of order. The Pax Romana, which translates as "Roman peace," was a time of relative peace and stability that spanned the whole Roman Empire. During this period, the order was upheld by a mix of military might, political stability, and effective administration. The Roman army maintained authority and put down rebellions, while the Roman government established a stable and unified administration. Furthermore, the Roman legal system contributed to the maintenance of order by providing a coherent set of rules and a system of justice. The Pax Romana was also aided by the development of roads, aqueducts, and other infrastructure that eased connection and commerce throughout the empire.
