The Pax Romana, which lasted from 27 B.C.E. to 180 C.E., is often cited as an example of a time of order in history. A unified and powerful government, a professional and disciplined armed force, and a framework of laws and institutions all contributed to the stability of the empire. Moreover, the construction of infrastructure like roads and communication networks that allowed commerce and the movement of people and products throughout the empire contributed to the Pax Romana. The conquest and control of territories by the Roman Republic and Roman Empire, as well as the establishment and maintenance of a stable political and administrative structure within those regions, were essential to the preservation of the Pax Romana.
