The Pax Romana, which lasted from 27 B.C.E. to 180 C.E., is often cited as a time of peace and stability in the history of the Roman Empire. Rome's military was among the strongest and best-organized in the ancient world, and its might and efficiency were crucial to maintaining the peace known as the Pax Romana. The Roman army successfully suppressed rebellions and invasions throughout the enormous empire, establishing a period of peace and stability. The Pax Romana was further aided by the rule of lawâ€“based Roman judicial system, which established a feeling of fairness and order. As part of its efforts to bring the very different peoples of the Roman Empire under a common banner of unity and law and order, the Roman government adopted a policy of religious tolerance.
