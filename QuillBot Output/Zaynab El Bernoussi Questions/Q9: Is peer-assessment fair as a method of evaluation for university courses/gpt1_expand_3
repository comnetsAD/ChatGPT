Peer assessment has the potential to be a just way of evaluation for university courses; nevertheless, its fairness is contingent on how it is carried out. Students may benefit from constructive criticism from their peers, which can also aid in their development of a more in-depth comprehension of the subject matter being covered. However, in order to guarantee that everything is handled in a fair manner, there are a few things that need to be taken into consideration. Students may not have the necessary knowledge or experience to provide an appropriate evaluation of the work produced by their classmates, which is one possible drawback of the peer review process. For this reason, it is essential to give students with training on how to deliver criticism that is both relevant and helpful. In addition, the instructor has to be active in the process in some way, whether it is guiding the students, evaluating their progress, or moderating the tests. The possibility of prejudice is yet another problem with peer evaluation. Personal biases such as friendliness, animosity, popularity, and other factors may have an effect on how peers evaluate one another. Therefore, it is essential to make certain that the procedure is conducted in an anonymous manner, or else to utilize a double-blind assessment technique, in which both the evaluator and the person being evaluated are unaware of the identity of the other. In conclusion, it is essential to take into account the relative importance of the evaluations given by classmates in determining the final grade. The appraisal of a student's performance by his or her peers should not be the exclusive way of grading, nor should it carry an excessive amount of weight in the overall score. In order to offer a more thorough review of a student's learning, it should be integrated with other types of evaluation, such as the assessment performed by the instructor, the student's own self-assessment, or tests. In conclusion, the use of peer evaluation as a technique of evaluation for university courses may be a fair approach; however, this relies on how it is executed. It need to be carried out in an organized and directed fashion, with the participation of the instructor, and it ought to be integrated with many other types of assessment.
