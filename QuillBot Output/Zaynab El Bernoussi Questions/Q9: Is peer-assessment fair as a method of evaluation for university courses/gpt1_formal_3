Peer evaluation may be a fair evaluation technique for university courses, depending on how it is handled. Peer evaluation, when conducted well, may give students with important feedback and help them achieve a better knowledge of the content. However, some elements must be taken into account to guarantee justice. A significant concern with peer evaluation is that students may lack the ability or experience to evaluate their classmates' work appropriately. Consequently, it is essential to instruct students on how to offer constructive and useful criticism. In addition, the instructor should be engaged by offering direction, monitoring, and moderating the exams. Another possible difficulty with peer evaluation is prejudice. Personal biases such as friendliness, hostility, popularity, etc., may influence peer evaluation. Therefore, it is essential to guarantee that the procedure is anonymous or to use a double-blind assessment technique in which the assessor and the evaluated do not know the identity of the other. Lastly, it is essential to evaluate the peer evaluation's weight in the final grade. Peer review should not be the exclusive form of evaluation, nor should it account for a disproportionate amount of the final grade. It should be paired with other modes of evaluation, such as teacher evaluation, self-evaluation, and tests, to offer a more thorough evaluation of student learning. Peer assessment may be a fair way of evaluation for university courses, but its implementation is crucial. It should be conducted in a systematic and directed manner, with the teacher's participation, and in conjunction with other types of evaluation.
