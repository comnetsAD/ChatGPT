In higher education, peer evaluation has the potential to be a reliable evaluative tool, but its efficacy relies on its implementation. Peer evaluation has the potential to give students with insightful comments and aid in the development of their grasp of the content if conducted properly. However, there are considerations that must be made to guarantee equity. It's possible that students won't be able to provide fair assessments of one another's work because they lack the necessary knowledge or experience. Since this is the case, instructing students on how to provide such criticism is crucial. The instructor should also play a role in this by offering direction, keeping tabs on progress, and serving as a moderator for the exams. One further thing that may go wrong with peer evaluation is prejudice. Personal biases such as friendliness, animosity, popularity, etc. might influence peer appraisal. For this reason, a double-blind assessment technique, in which neither the assessor nor the appraised knows the identity of the other, is recommended. Finally, think about how much weight the peer evaluation will have in your overall score. In addition to not being the only criterion for a student's final grade, peer evaluations should not carry too much weight. If you want a more accurate picture of a student's progress, you should use it in conjunction with instructor assessment, student self-evaluation, and formal examinations. In essence, peer assessment has the potential to be an equitable means of grading in higher education settings, but this will rely on the specifics of its implementation. It is important that this process be well-organized and supervised by the instructor, and that it be used in conjunction with other types of assessment.
