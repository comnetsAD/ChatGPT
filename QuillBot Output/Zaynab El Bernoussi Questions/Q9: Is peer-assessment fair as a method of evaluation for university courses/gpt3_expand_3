If it is done and organized in the right way, peer assessment at the university level has the potential to be an objective form of course evaluation. The fairness of peer evaluation may be affected by a number of different circumstances, including the following: Instruction: Peers should be instructed on how to assess work in a way that is fair and objective, as well as how to offer feedback that is constructive and helpful. Students need to have crystal-clear standards and criteria laid out for them on what aspects of their work will be reviewed by their classmates and how their work will be evaluated overall. Anonymity: By eliminating the effect of personal ties and other variables not related to academics, anonymous peer assessment may assist to decrease prejudice and assure impartiality in the evaluation process. Participation of the Instructor: The instructor has to take part in the procedure in order to guarantee that the feedback offered is both correct and objective. In addition, the instructor is able to provide help and direction to the pupils at any point throughout the process. Students get the opportunity to evaluate their own work and determine any areas in which it may be improved prior to submitting it to be graded by their classmates. This is an additional method for ensuring that the grading process is fair. However, it is important to note that peer assessment is not the only method of evaluation for university courses. It is recommended that peer assessment be used in conjunction with other methods, such as tests, quizzes, and assignments, in order to provide a more comprehensive evaluation of student learning. Additionally, it is very crucial to take into consideration the inherent limits of peer evaluation, such as the likelihood of prejudice, the lack of knowledge, and inconsistent input.
