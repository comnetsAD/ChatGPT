Although evaluation by peers in university courses has the potential to be an objective and fair system, it is not without its own set of constraints. Peer assessment has a number of benefits, one of which is that it may give many viewpoints on student learning, which can assist to guarantee that the assessments are fair and accurate. Peer assessment is one of the most common forms of assessment used today. In addition, the process of students evaluating the work of their classmates provides them with the chance to learn from one another and get a more profound comprehension of the subject matter. However, there are also certain restrictions associated with the use of peer evaluation. Students, for instance, may be prejudiced in their assessments of one another, either intentionally or subconsciously, depending on the situation. It is possible that as a result of this, assessments will not be accurate or fair. Additionally, students may be hesitant to provide constructive criticism to their classmates out of concern that doing so may strain their relationships. This may result in reviews that are too favorable or are devoid of any relevant content. Another limitation of the method is that it might not be appropriate for all types of classes. For example, it might not be appropriate for certain technical or professional classes because the abilities and knowledge that are being evaluated might be too complicated for students to accurately evaluate their classmates. Peer evaluation in higher education courses has the potential to be an objective form of evaluation when taken as a whole, but it is not without its own set of restrictions. It is essential for instructors to carefully analyze whether or not peer assessment is appropriate for the courses they teach, and it is equally essential for instructors to give students with specific rules and training so that evaluations are both fair and accurate.
