Peer assessment has its own drawbacks but may be a reasonable form of course evaluation in higher education. Peer assessment has the potential to provide a variety of viewpoints on student learning, which may assist to verify that the assessments are accurate and fair. Students also get the chance to learn from one another and develop a better grasp of the subject matter as they assess the work of their classmates. Peer evaluation does have certain restrictions, however. For instance, students could inadvertently or deliberately have prejudiced opinions about their classmates. Evaluations that are not accurate or fair may result from this. Students could also be hesitant to provide constructive criticism to their classmates out of concern for their connections. Evaluations that are too favorable or meaningless might result from this. Another drawback is that not all course types may be appropriate for the approach, such as certain technical or professional courses where students may not be able to effectively evaluate their peers due to the complexity of the skills and information being assessed. Peer assessment has certain drawbacks but may generally be considered a fair form of course evaluation in higher education. In order to guarantee that assessments are honest and accurate, it is crucial for professors to carefully analyze whether peer assessment is appropriate for their courses. They should also provide students clear instructions and training.
