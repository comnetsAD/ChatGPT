Peer assessment is fair for university courses, but it has its drawbacks. Peer assessment helps promote fair and accurate assessments by providing diverse viewpoints on student learning. Students may learn from one other and improve their comprehension by evaluating each other's work. Peer assessment has limits. Students may subconsciously or intentionally judge their classmates. This may result in biased assessments. Students may also worry hurting relationships by giving harsh criticism. This may provide meaningless or unduly favorable reviews. The approach may not be suited for technical or professional courses because students may not be able to correctly judge their classmates. Peer assessment for university courses is fair, yet it has its drawbacks. Teachers should carefully evaluate peer assessment for their courses and give clear instructions and training for students to guarantee fair and accurate ratings.
