Depending on how it is used, peer assessment may be a fair means of grading university courses. Peer evaluation, when done correctly, may provide students insightful comments and aid in their grasp of the subject matter. To guarantee justice, however, a few things must be taken into account. Peer evaluation may run into trouble if students lack the knowledge or experience necessary to fairly assess one another's work. Therefore, it's critical to teach pupils how to provide insightful and constructive criticism. The instructor should also be active in the process by giving instructions, supervising, and moderating the exams. Bias is yet another possible problem with peer evaluation. Personal biases, such as friendliness, animosity, popularity, etc., might influence peer evaluation. As a result, it's crucial to adopt a double-blind assessment technique where neither the assessor nor the appraised are aware of each other's identities. Finally, it's important to take into account how much the peer evaluation contributes to the final grade. Peer review shouldn't be the sole way of assessment and shouldn't count for too much when determining the grade. To give a more thorough evaluation of students' learning, it should be integrated with other types of evaluation such tests, instructor assessments, and self-assessments. In conclusion, depending on how it is used, peer assessment may be a fair way of course evaluation at the university level. It should be integrated with other methods of assessment and carried out in a systematic, directed manner with the teacher's participation.
