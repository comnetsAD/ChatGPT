While there are benefits to using peer review in higher education, there are also drawbacks to consider. Peer assessment has the potential to improve the reliability of assessments by providing students with various viewpoints on their own learning. The process of peer assessment also provides students with a chance to learn from and teach one another about the subject matter. Peer evaluation can have its drawbacks, however. To provide one example, it's possible that students' assessments of their classmates are colored by unconscious or intentional biases. There is a risk that this may result in unfair or inaccurate ratings being given. In addition, some students can be hesitant to provide constructive criticism for fear of upsetting their classmates. This may cause unrealistically high or meaningless ratings. Another drawback is that the approach may not work for all sorts of classes. For example, students in technical or professional classes may not be able to fairly evaluate their classmates' abilities since the material is too advanced. Peer assessment, in general, may be a reasonable means of grading college courses, although it does have its drawbacks. Teachers need to think critically about whether or not peer assessment is appropriate for their classes and then provide students clear instructions and training to make sure the assessments are valid.
