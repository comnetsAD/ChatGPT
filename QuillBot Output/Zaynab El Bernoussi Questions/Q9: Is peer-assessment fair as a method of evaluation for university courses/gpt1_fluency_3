Peer assessment may be a fair technique of evaluating university courses, depending on how it is used. When done correctly, peer evaluation may give vital feedback to students while also assisting them in gaining a better comprehension of the content. However, some elements must be taken into account to guarantee justice. One possible concern with peer evaluation is that students may lack the competence or experience needed to appropriately evaluate their classmates' work. As a result, it is critical to teach students how to offer constructive and relevant criticism. The instructor should also be active in the process by offering advice, monitoring, and regulating the assessments. Bias is another possible concern with peer evaluation. Personal biases such as friendliness, hostility, popularity, and so on might influence peer appraisal. As a result, it is critical to guarantee that the procedure is anonymous, or to use a double-blind assessment technique in which the assessor and the evaluated are unaware of each other's identities. Finally, the weight of peer evaluation in the final grade must be considered. Peer review should not be the exclusive form of evaluation, nor should it be given undue weight in the final grade. To give a more thorough evaluation of student learning, it should be paired with other modes of evaluation such as instructor assessment, self-assessment, or tests. In conclusion, peer assessment may be a fair approach of evaluating university courses, but how it is handled is critical. It should be done in a systematic and directed manner, with the assistance of the instructor, and integrated with other types of assessment.
