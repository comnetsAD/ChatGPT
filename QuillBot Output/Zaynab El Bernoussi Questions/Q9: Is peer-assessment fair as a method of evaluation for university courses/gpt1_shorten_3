Peer assessment for university courses may be fair if done properly. Peer evaluation done effectively may help students grasp the content better. Fairness requires considering certain things. Students may not be qualified to judge their classmates' work. Thus, students must learn to provide constructive and relevant comments. Teachers should guide, monitor, and moderate assessments. Peer judgement may be biased. Friendship, animosity, popularity, etc. might influence peer appraisal. Thus, a double-blind review procedure or anonymity are essential. Finally, peer evaluation should count toward the final grade. Peer assessment should not be the only criterion for grading, nor should it be heavily weighted. To better measure student learning, it should be integrated with instructor assessment, self-assessment, and tests. In conclusion, peer assessment may be fair for university course evaluations if done properly. It should be supervised by the instructor and complemented with other assessment methods.
