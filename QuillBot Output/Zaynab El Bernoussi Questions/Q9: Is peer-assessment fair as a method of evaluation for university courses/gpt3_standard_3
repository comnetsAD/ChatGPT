If peer assessment is done and organized appropriately, it may be a fair way of evaluation for university courses. The fairness of peer review may be affected by a number of issues, including: Training: Peers should get instruction on how to assess work fairly and objectively as well as how to provide constructive criticism. Guidelines: Students should be given clear instructions on how their work will be judged by their peers as well as the standards and guidelines that will be used to evaluate them. Anonymity: By taking the effect of interpersonal connections and other non-academic elements out of the equation, anonymous peer evaluation may assist to minimize prejudice and assure impartiality. Instructor participation: The teacher should be included in the process to guarantee that the feedback given is truthful and impartial. The instructor may help the pupils along the way by offering encouragement and direction. Self-assessment: Before their work is evaluated by their peers, students may reflect on their own work and highlight any areas that want improvement. This is another technique to guarantee fairness. Peer assessment should be used in conjunction with other techniques, such as tests, quizzes, and assignments, to give a more thorough evaluation of student learning, since peer assessment is not the sole way of evaluation for university courses. The possible drawbacks of peer evaluation should also be taken into account, including prejudice, a lack of knowledge, and inconsistent input.
