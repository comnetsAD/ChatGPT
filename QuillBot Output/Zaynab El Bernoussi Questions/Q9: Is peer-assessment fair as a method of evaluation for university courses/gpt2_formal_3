Peer review may be a fair evaluation approach for university courses, but it has its own limits. Peer assessment has the potential to give diverse viewpoints on student learning, which may contribute to the assessments' fairness and accuracy. In addition, when students review the work of their classmates, they have the chance to learn from one another and obtain a greater grasp of the subject matter. However, peer evaluation does have certain limits. For instance, students may be either knowingly or unwittingly prejudiced in their peer assessments. This may lead to inaccurate and unfair assessments. In addition, students may be hesitant to provide negative comments for fear of harming relationships. This might result in unduly favorable or meaningless assessments. The approach may not be applicable for all sorts of courses, such as some technical or professional courses in which the skills and information being assessed may be too complicated for students to correctly evaluate their peers. Peer assessment may be a fair technique of grading university courses, but it also has its drawbacks. Teachers must carefully analyze the applicability of peer assessment for their courses and offer students with clear instructions and training to ensure that evaluations are accurate and fair.
