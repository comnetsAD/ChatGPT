It's arguable that in a capitalist society, a monetary value is assigned to almost everything, and that one's capacity to pay for products and services is often a determining factor in whether or not they may access those goods and services. However, it would be inaccurate to state that everything has some kind of cost associated with it. There are certain things that are seen as being incomparably valuable, such as a human life, freedom, justice, and a host of other things. In addition, many individuals and organizations, such as philanthropic, volunteer, and non-profit organisations, work hard to offer products and services that do not necessarily have a price tag, such as education, medical treatment, and assistance for those who are less fortunate. In addition, there are some pursuits, like the arts and culture, that are not open to commercialization since they are not regarded to have a monetary value. It is thus not totally correct to claim that everything has a price, despite the fact that the idea that everything has a price is evident in certain elements of our society.
