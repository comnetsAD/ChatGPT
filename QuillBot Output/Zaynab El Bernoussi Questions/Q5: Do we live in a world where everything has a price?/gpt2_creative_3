The capacity to pay for products and services may be seen as a key factor in determining who has access to them in a capitalist society. Yet, it would be wrong to assert that nothing is free. Human life, freedom, justice, and so on are all examples of concepts that cannot be put into monetary terms. Many individuals and organizations outside of the for-profit sector also strive to help those in need by providing services and resources like education, healthcare, and financial aid that cannot be put into a price tag. Some pursuits, like the appreciation of art and cultural practices, are inherently intangible and hence cannot be monetized. It is thus not totally correct to claim that everything in our society has a price, even while the idea that everything has a price is evident in certain contexts.
