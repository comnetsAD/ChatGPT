One may argue that many things in a capitalist society have a monetary worth and that access to products and services is often based on one's capacity to pay for them. To suggest that everything has a cost, however, is untrue. Some things, like human life, freedom, justice, and so on, are regarded as priceless. Additionally, a lot of individuals and organisations, including non-profit, volunteer, and philanthropic organizations, labor to provide products and services that may not have a price tag, such assistance for the less fortunate, healthcare, and education. There are however other pursuits that are exempt from commercialization since they are regarded as precious, like art and culture. Therefore, even while the idea that everything has a price is prevalent in certain sectors of our society, it is not totally true to assert that this is the case.
