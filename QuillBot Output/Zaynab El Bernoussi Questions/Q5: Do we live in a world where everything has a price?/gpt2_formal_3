In a capitalist society, it may be claimed that many things are assigned a monetary value and that access to products and services is often contingent on the capacity to pay for them. However, it is incorrect to assert that everything has a cost. Some things are deemed priceless, such as human life, liberty, and justice, among others. In addition, many individuals and organizations, such as non-profit, volunteer, and philanthropic groups, seek to offer products and services that may not have a price tag, such as education, health care, and assistance for the disadvantaged. There are some pursuits, such as art and culture, that cannot be commercialized since they are deemed precious. So, although the notion that everything has a price is prevalent in certain elements of our culture, it is not totally correct to state that everything has a price.
