It may be claimed that we live in a society where many objects have monetary values, and that these values are often utilized to determine their worth. For example, in a capitalist economy, commodities and services are created and traded for money, and the worth of a commodity is often defined by how much it can sell for. However, it is equally critical to remember that not everything can be measured in monetary terms. Some things, like love, friendship, and natural beauty, may have intrinsic worth that cannot be quantified in dollars or other kinds of money. Furthermore, certain items, such as fundamental human rights, access to healthcare, education, and clean water, are seen as vital for human well-being and survival, and are regarded as having inherent moral worth that transcends monetary value.
