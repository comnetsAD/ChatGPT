Many items have a monetary value, and this value is frequently used to gauge their worth. In a capitalist economy, products and services are created and sold for money, determining their worth. However, not everything has a monetary worth. Love, companionship, and nature's beauty may have worth beyond money. Basic human rights, access to healthcare, education, and clean water are important for human well-being and survival and have inherent moral worth.
