It may be argued that the tenet that everything has a price is the foundation of our present economic system in many respects. This is so because our economy is based on the supply and demand theory, in which commodities and services are traded for cash. The majority of products and services in the market are offered in this manner. But certain goods, like love, friendship, and other types of social contact, for instance, do not have a price and are not intended to be sold for cash. Additionally, certain products and services, such as those that are supplied by the government as a right to its residents rather than being exchangeable for money and include healthcare and education, are regarded as public goods. In our society, there is the idea of "priceless" objects, although they are not necessarily taken into account in an economic sense.
