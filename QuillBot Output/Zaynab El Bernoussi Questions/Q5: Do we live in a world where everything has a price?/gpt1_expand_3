The idea that everything has a price underlies our present economic system in many different ways; one might even argue that this idea is the foundation of the system itself. This is due to the fact that the supply and demand model, in which goods and services are traded for monetary value, underpins the functioning of our economy. This is how the vast majority of a market's products and services are made available to customers. However, there are other things that are not assigned a price and are not intended to be traded for money. Some examples of these things include love, friendship, and other types of social contact. These things are not designed to be bought and sold for money. In addition, there are some items and services that are regarded as public goods. These are items and services, such as education and medical treatment, that cannot be purchased with money but are instead supplied by the government as a privilege for its residents. In our society, there are items that might be deemed "priceless," yet these things are not generally taken into account when discussing economics.
