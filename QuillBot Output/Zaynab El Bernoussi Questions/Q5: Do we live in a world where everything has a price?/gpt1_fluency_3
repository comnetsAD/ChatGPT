In many respects, our present economic system may be said to be predicated on the notion that everything has a price. This is due to the fact that our economy is based on the supply and demand concept, in which commodities and services are traded for money. This is how the majority of products and services are delivered in the market. However, some goods, such as love, friendship, and other types of social contact, do not have a price and are not designed to be traded for money. Furthermore, certain commodities and services, such as education and healthcare, are considered public goods since they are not exchangeable for money and are instead supplied by the government as a right to people. The notion of "priceless" objects exists in our society, although it is not often addressed in a financial context.
