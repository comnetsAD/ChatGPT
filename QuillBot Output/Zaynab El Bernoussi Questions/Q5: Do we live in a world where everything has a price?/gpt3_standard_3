One may argue that because so many items in our world have monetary values, their worth is often determined by these values. For instance, in a capitalist economy, commodities and services are produced and traded for money, and a product's worth is often based on how much it can fetch on the open market. But it's also critical to understand that not everything can be valued in terms of money. Love, friendship, and the beauty of nature are a few examples of things that may have greater inherent worth than can be expressed in dollars or other kinds of money. In addition, certain items, such as fundamental human rights, access to healthcare, education, and clean water, are seen to be necessary for human life and well-being and to have inherent moral worth that transcends monetary value.
