It is arguable that we live in a society in which a great deal of everything has a monetary value, and that this value is often used as a yardstick to determine how valuable things are. In a capitalist economy, for instance, products and services are created and traded for monetary value; also, the worth of a thing is often decided by how much demand there is for that commodity in the marketplace. However, it is essential to be aware that not everything can be measured in terms of a monetary worth. This is one of the most important things to keep in mind. There are certain things, like love, friendship, and the beauty of nature, that may have a worth that cannot be quantified in dollars or any other kind of money. These things may have an intrinsic value. Additionally, there are certain goods that are believed to be vital for human well-being and survival and are deemed to have an inherent moral worth that goes beyond a price tag. Some examples of these things are fundamental human rights, access to healthcare, education, and clean water.
