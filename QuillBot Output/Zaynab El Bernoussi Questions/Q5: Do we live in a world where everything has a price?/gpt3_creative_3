It may be claimed that in today's society, the monetary value of an item is often utilized as a proxy for its true worth. Products and services in a capitalist economy, for instance, are created and sold to consumers in return for money, and the worth of an item is often defined by how much it can be sold for. Still, one must admit that not everything has a monetary worth. Love, friendship, and the natural beauty of the world are examples of things that may have worth beyond what can be put into monetary terms. Furthermore, there are certain goods that are believed to have an innate moral worth that exceeds a price-tag, such as fundamental human rights, access to healthcare, education, and clean water.
