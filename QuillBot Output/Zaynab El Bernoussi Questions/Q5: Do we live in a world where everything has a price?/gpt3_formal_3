It might be claimed that we live in a world where many objects have monetary value and this value is often utilized to determine their value. In a capitalist economy, for instance, commodities and services are produced and traded for money, and a product's worth is often defined by how much it can be sold for. Nonetheless, it is essential to remember that not everything can be measured in monetary terms. Some things, such as love, friendship, and natural beauty, may have intrinsic worth that cannot be quantified in dollars or other currencies. In addition, certain items, like as fundamental human rights, access to healthcare, education, and clean water, are deemed indispensable to the well-being and survival of humans and have an inherent moral worth that cannot be quantified.
