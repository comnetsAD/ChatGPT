In many respects, our present economic system is predicated on the idea that everything has a price. Our supply-and-demand system exchanges products and services for money. Most products and services are sold this way. However, love, friendship, and other social interactions cannot be bought or sold. Education and healthcare are public commodities that the government provides as a right to people. Our world has "priceless" items, but they are not usually viewed economically.
