One may argue that our present economic system is founded on the concept that everything has a price. This is because our economy is based on the supply-and-demand concept, in which commodities and services are traded for currency. This is how the majority of products and services are distributed on the market. Love, friendship, and other types of social contact, for example, cannot be valued and are not intended to be sold for money. In addition, certain commodities and services, such as education and healthcare, are considered public goods since they cannot be exchanged for money but are given by the government as a right for people. In our society, the notion of "priceless" items exists, although they are not necessarily treated in an economic context.
