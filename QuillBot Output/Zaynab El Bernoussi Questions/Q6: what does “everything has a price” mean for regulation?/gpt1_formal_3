The expression "everything has a price" implies that everything can be purchased and sold, and that everything has a monetary worth. This may have a variety of ramifications for regulation: It may result in a greater emphasis on the economic worth of products and services and less on other values, such as social or environmental effect. This might result in a lack of control or regulation in sectors where economic advantages outweigh other factors. It may also result in the commodification of formerly non-marketable products and services, including healthcare, education, and natural resources. This may result in more control and regulation in certain areas to guarantee its usage in the public good. In certain circumstances, it might result un the inaccessibility of certain products and services to particular individuals due to a lack of control or monitoring about cost. In order to acquire access to a product or service, individuals may be ready to pay bribes or participate in other unethical behavior. The notion that "everything has a price" may be a difficulty for regulators who must strike a balance between the economic worth of products and services and other values such as social and environmental effect, accessibility, and justice. It is essential to have laws in place to guarantee that commodities and services are utilized in the public interest and that people' rights and welfare are safeguarded.
