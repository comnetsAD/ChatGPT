Everything that can be bought or sold has a price, as the adage goes. Several regulatory considerations may be affected by this: It may cause people to prioritize monetary gains above other values, such as those associated with their products' social or environmental impacts. When financial gains exceed other factors, regulation and monitoring may be relaxed. Healthcare, education, and natural resources are just a few examples of areas that might be commodified if this trend continues. To make sure these tools are utilized for the greater good, this may result in more regulations and more control in certain areas. This may lead to a lack of control or monitoring on the cost of products and services, which can make them unaffordable for certain individuals. It also opens the door for corruption to take place, since some individuals may be prepared to break the law in exchange for a service or commodity. When trying to strike a balance between the economic worth of products and services and other values like their influence on society and the environment, their accessibility, and their justice, the assumption that "everything has a price" may be problematic for regulators. To safeguard the rights and well-being of people and guarantee that products and services are utilized for the common good, rules and regulations must be in place.
