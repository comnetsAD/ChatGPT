"Everything has a price" implies that everything is for sale and has a value. This has many regulatory implications: It may emphasize commercial value above social and environmental consequences. This may lead to lax regulation or monitoring in sectors where economic advantages outweigh other factors. It may also commodify non-market goods and services including healthcare, education, and natural resources. To guarantee public interest usage, this may lead to further regulation and control. It may make certain products and services excessively costly for some individuals, resulting in a lack of affordability regulation. It may also lead to corruption, since individuals may pay bribes or do other immoral things to get a good or service. Regulators must balance economic worth, social and environmental effect, accessibility, and justice, so "everything has a price" might be difficult. Regulations are necessary to preserve residents' rights and utilize products and services in the public interest.
