The concept of "everything has a price" has various ramifications for regulation. Economic efficiency assumes that markets can be used to distribute resources and that prices can be used to convey relative scarcity of resources. In this scenario, authorities may seek to limit involvement and let market forces to decide pricing and resource allocation. Inequalities: Because everything has a price, some individuals may be able to buy certain products and services while others may not. This may result in severe inequities, especially for commodities and services deemed necessary for human well-being and survival. Regulators may seek to remedy these disparities by enacting regulations that provide equitable access to these products and services for everyone, regardless of financial means. Externalities: The expenses of many operations are not represented in the pricing of the products and services produced. These expenses are referred to as externalities. Regulators may seek to internalize these externalities by pricing them via taxes, subsidies, or cap-and-trade systems. Consumer protection: When everything has a price, businesses may engage in damaging consumer behaviors such as price gouging, deceptive advertising, or concealing information about possible hazards. Regulators may seek to safeguard consumers by enforcing fines against corporations that break these standards and enacting legislation that ban certain activities. Environmental protection: When everything has a cost, businesses may participate in environmentally destructive activities such as pollution, deforestation, or overfishing. Regulators may seek to safeguard the environment by imposing fines on corporations that breach these standards and enacting regulations that ban certain practices.
