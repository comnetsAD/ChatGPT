Regulation may be affected by the notion that "everything has a price" in a number of different ways. One approach is that when something is seen to have a monetary worth, it might incentivize people and organizations to put money above other factors like moral or ethical standards. This may result in problems like price gouging, exploitation, and market manipulation, all of which may have detrimental effects on society. This approach also has the potential to result in the commercialization of commodities and services that weren't previously thought to have a monetary worth. As a consequence, traditionally public goods and services including healthcare, education, and natural resources may now be privatized. This may result in the abuse of these resources for financial gain as well as the inability of people who cannot afford to pay for them to access these products and services. Governments and other regulatory agencies often enact laws and policies to address these problems in order to guarantee that people and organizations are held responsible for their actions and that the interests of society as a whole are safeguarded. Price limits, anti-trust legislation, and rules to stop price gouging and exploitation are a few examples of this. In addition, the government may guarantee that all residents, regardless of their financial situation, have access to fundamental commodities and services.
