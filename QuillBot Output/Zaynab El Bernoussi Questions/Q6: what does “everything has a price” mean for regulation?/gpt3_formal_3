The concept that "everything has a price" has several regulatory ramifications. When objects are seen to have monetary worth, it may encourage people and organizations to prioritize money gain above other concerns, such as ethical or moral ideals. This may result in problems such as price gouging, exploitation, and market manipulation, which can have detrimental effects on society. This concept may also lead to the commercialization of commodities and services that were not previously considered to have a monetary value. This may lead to the privatization of formerly public goods and services, including healthcare, education, and natural resources. This may result in inaccessibility to these products and services for those who cannot afford to pay for them, as well as the exploitation of these resources for financial gain. To address these concerns, governments and other regulatory agencies often adopt rules and policies to guarantee that people and organizations are held responsible for their activities and that society's interests are safeguarded. This may include price limits, antitrust laws, and rules designed to combat price gouging and exploitation. In addition, the government may give all residents, regardless of their capacity to pay, with access to fundamental commodities and services.
