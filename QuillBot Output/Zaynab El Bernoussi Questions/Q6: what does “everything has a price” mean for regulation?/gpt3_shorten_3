"Everything has a price" has numerous regulatory consequences. When things have a monetary value, it might encourage people and organizations to put money above ethics or morality. Price-gouging, exploitation, and market manipulation may harm society. This approach may also commodify previously unvalued items and services. This might privatize healthcare, education, and natural resources. This may deprive low-income people of these products and services and profiteer from them. Governments and other regulatory bodies typically enact rules and policies to hold people and corporations responsible and defend society's interests. Price limits, anti-trust legislation, and price-gouging and exploitation statutes are examples. Government may also give essential commodities and services to everyone, regardless of income.
