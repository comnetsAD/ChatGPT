There are a number of ways in which the "everything has a price" principle might inform regulatory policy. One approach is that when things are given a monetary value, people and institutions may be tempted to put it ahead of other important values, including ethics and morals. Negative social effects, such as price gouging, exploitation, and market manipulation, may result. This concept also has the potential to result in the commercialization of items and services that were previously not considered to have monetary worth. Because of this, several once public services and resources, including healthcare, education, and the environment, may be privatized. This may lead to the abuse of these resources for financial gain and also prevent the poor from having access to these products and services. Governments and other regulatory bodies typically create legislation and policies to address these problems, with the goal of enforcing accountability on people and organizations and protecting the public interest. Some examples of such measures include price limits, anti-trust legislation, and other rules meant to curb exploitative pricing practices. As an added bonus, the government may ensure that all residents, regardless of income, have access to essential services and resources.
