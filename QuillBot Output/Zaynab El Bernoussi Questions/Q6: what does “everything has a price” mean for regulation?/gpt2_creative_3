There are a number of ways in which the "everything has a price" principle might inform regulatory policy. If everything has a price, then markets may be used to distribute resources, and prices can signify the relative scarcity of resources, leading to greater economic efficiency. To enable pricing and resource allocation to be set by market forces may be a goal of regulators in this setting. Disparities in access to resources: If everything has a price, then some individuals will have more disposable income than others and others would have less. This may cause major inequities, especially for basic necessities. As a means of resolving these disparities, regulators may seek to establish regulations that guarantee universal access to certain commodities and services, regardless of a person's financial standing. Many activities incur expenses that are not internalized by the market pricing of the products and services that result from them. We call these expenses "externalities." Taxes, subsidies, or cap-and-trade systems may be used by regulators in an effort to "internalize" these externalities by giving them a monetary value. Protection for consumers in an economy where everything must be sold and where dishonest advertising and withholding of information about hazards are commonplace. The goal of the regulators is to safeguard the customers, thus they may pass laws banning certain activities and imposing fines on businesses that engage in them. When everything must be valued, businesses may participate in practices that are bad for the environment, such as polluting, cutting down trees, or overfishing. To safeguard the environment, regulators may outlaw such practices and levy fines on businesses that disobey the rules.
