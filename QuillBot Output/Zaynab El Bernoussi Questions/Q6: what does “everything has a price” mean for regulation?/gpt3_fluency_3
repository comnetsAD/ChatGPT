The concept of "everything has a price" has various ramifications for regulation. When objects are seen to have monetary worth, it may provide an incentive for people and organizations to prioritize money gain above other concerns, such as ethical or moral ideals. This may lead to price gouging, exploitation, and market manipulation, all of which can have a detrimental influence on society. Another consequence of this theory is that it may lead to the commercialization of previously unvalued commodities and services. As a consequence, formerly public goods and services, such as healthcare, education, and natural resources, may be privatized. This may result in a lack of access to certain products and services for people who cannot afford to pay for them, as well as profiteering from them. To address these concerns, governments and other regulatory bodies often enact rules and policies to guarantee that people and organizations are held responsible for their actions and that society's interests are safeguarded. Price limits, anti-trust legislation, and rules to combat price gouging and exploitation are examples of such measures. Furthermore, the government may give essential goods and services to all individuals, regardless of their capacity to pay.
