Catharsis is expressing pent-up emotions like wrath or frustration. The assumption is that expressing these feelings would relieve them. Catharsis typically backfires for two reasons: Cathartic conduct may be extremely strong or forceful, causing wrath or irritation rather than comfort. Cathartic conduct may empower or validate, increasing aggressive behavior. Catharsis is popular because it is straightforward and intuitive. Catharsis is sometimes used in popular culture to cope with bad emotions. Catharsis may seem like a good approach to handle emotions. Recent study reveals that healthy, productive emotional expression is more helpful than catharsis.
