The release of pent-up emotions via acts or behaviors, such as hostility or violence, is referred to as catharsis. It is the belief that expressing these emotions helps lessen emotional stress and violence or rage. Two reasons explain why catharsis acts often have the opposite impact intended: Cathartic activities may reward and sustain violent behavior, making it more likely to reoccur in the future. Transfer of arousal: Expressing hostility in one context may enhance overall arousal levels, which in turn might promote aggression in other situations. Catharsis gives an apparently easy and uncomplicated answer to the issue of aggressiveness and fury, which is one reason for its continued popularity. In addition, it may be pleasurable to vent rage and aggressiveness physically or verbally, which is a common reason why individuals believe it to be a successful remedy.
