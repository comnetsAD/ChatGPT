Through activity or expression, catharsis is the release of pent-up emotions, such as wrath or frustration. The belief that expressing or releasing these feelings would provide emotional relief or release. Two reasons explain why catharsis acts often have the opposite impact intended: The cathartic action may be too strong or forceful, resulting in heightened emotions of wrath or frustration rather than release. A feeling of empowerment or affirmation may result from cathartic activity, leading to an increase in violent conduct. One reason why the notion of catharsis is so popular is that it is a straightforward, intuitive idea that is easy to comprehend and practice. Additionally, media and popular culture often present catharsis as a means of coping with bad feelings. This might lead individuals to feel that catharsis is an effective method of emotion management. Recent study reveals, however, that catharsis may not be as helpful as originally believed and that healthy and constructive expression of emotions is more beneficial than catharsis.
