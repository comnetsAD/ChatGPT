Expressions of intense emotions, such as rage or aggressiveness, may be cathartic because they allow us to let go of suppressed energy. According to the theory of catharsis, releasing these emotions may help people feel better and make them less prone to act destructively. Catharsis activities often have the opposite impact due to two factors: The act of verbally expressing anger or aggressiveness has been shown to increase the likelihood that the target would engage in more hostile conduct. That may actually make bad conduct more likely to occur. Anger directed towards one person or circumstance might be projected onto others. As a result, this may encourage more undesirable actions. Catharsis as a notion remains popular because it gives a straightforward rationale for undesirable actions. It's a simple explanation for aggressive conduct, which is often puzzling to those who approach it from a psychiatric standpoint. Additionally, individuals generally feel better after releasing their feelings, which might lead them to assume that catharsis is helpful.
