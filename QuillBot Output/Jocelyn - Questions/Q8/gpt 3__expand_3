The expression "catharsis" refers to the process of releasing suppressed feelings via actions or behaviors, such as acting aggressively or violently. The notion that expressing these sentiments might help release emotional tension and lessen feelings of hostility or rage is what this concept refers to. Two reasons as to why catharsis acts often have the opposite impact of what was intended are as follows: Engaging in cathartic actions may reinforce and perpetuate violent behavior, making it more likely to occur in the future. This is because these acts are designed to release pent-up tension and stress. Arousal transfer: Using aggressive behavior in one circumstance may lead to an increase in general arousal levels, which in turn can lead to an increase in aggressive behavior in other circumstances. The provision of a solution to the issue of hostility and fury that seems to be simple and uncomplicated in nature is one reason why the concept of catharsis continues to be popular. It is simple to comprehend, and it is tempting to think, that releasing one's emotions would inevitably lead to a release of tension and a decrease in violent behavior. This is because it is easy to grasp, and because it might be tempting to believe. People have a tendency to believe that it is a successful solution because it may be pleasurable to vent rage and fury in a physical or verbal manner. This is another reason why people prefer to believe that it is effective.
