Catharsis is the manifestation or expression of pent-up emotions such as rage or irritation. The assumption is that expressing or releasing these feelings would result in emotional relief or release. There are two arguments for why catharsis practices often have the opposite intended effect: Cathartic conduct that is overly strong or violent may result in heightened emotions of wrath or frustration rather than relief. Cathartic activity may result in a feeling of empowerment or validation, which may result in an increase in violent conduct. One reason catharsis is popular is that it is a basic, straightforward notion that is simple to learn and execute. Furthermore, catharsis is often depicted in the media and popular culture as a means of dealing with bad feelings. People may feel that catharsis is an efficient technique to regulate their emotions as a result of this. Recent study, however, reveals that catharsis may be less helpful than previously assumed, and that expressing emotions in a healthy and productive manner is more useful than catharsis.
