Through the expression of powerful emotions like wrath or hostility, catharsis is the release of stored up emotional energy. According to the idea of catharsis, people will feel better and be less inclined to participate in harmful activities if they express their emotions. There are two reasons why catharsis acts often have the unintended consequence: Aggression is reinforced when it is expressed, which increases the likelihood that the behavior will continue in the future. Instead of decreasing negative behavior, this can enhance it. Aggressiveness displacement: When anger or aggression is directed towards a particular person or circumstance, it may be displaced onto other individuals or circumstances. Additionally, it could cause a rise in undesirable conduct. The concept of catharsis is still widely accepted in part because it offers an easy-to-understand justification for why individuals behave badly. It is a simple approach to comprehend why individuals act aggressively, which may be challenging to comprehend from a psychological standpoint. People may also think that catharsis is beneficial since they often feel relieved after releasing their feelings.
