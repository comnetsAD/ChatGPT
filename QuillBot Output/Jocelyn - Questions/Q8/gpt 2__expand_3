The letting out of suppressed feelings, such as rage or frustration, may be cathartic when they are released via activity or expression. The concept that expressing or releasing these feelings will result in a feeling of emotional relief or release is at the core of this philosophy. Two reasons as to why catharsis acts often have the opposite impact of what was intended are as follows: There is a possibility that the cathartic action is too strong or forceful, which may result in heightened emotions of wrath or frustration rather than relief. Aggressive conduct may result from a person feeling empowered or validated after engaging in cathartic action, which in turn may lead to an increase in aggressive behavior. One of the reasons why the notion of catharsis is still so often used today is that it is a straightforward idea that is simple to comprehend and straightforward to put into practice. Additionally, the media and other forms of popular culture often present catharsis as a method for overcoming bad feelings and emotions. Because of this, some individuals could get the impression that catharsis is an efficient approach to deal with their feelings. Catharsis, on the other hand, may not be as helpful as was previously assumed, and current research reveals that expressing emotions in a healthy and constructive manner is more useful than catharsis.
