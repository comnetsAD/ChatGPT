When emotions are let go via acts or behaviors like violence or hostility, it's referred to as catharsis. It is the notion that letting these sentiments out will ease emotional stress and lessen feelings of hostility or wrath. There are two reasons why catharsis acts often have the unintended consequence: Aggressive behavior reinforcement: Taking part in cathartic activities may support and sustain aggressive conduct, increasing the likelihood that it will happen again. Aggressiveness may be transferred due to an increase in general arousal caused by expressing aggression in one setting. The concept of catharsis is still widely accepted in part because it offers what seems to be a clear-cut solution to the issue of aggressiveness and rage. It is understandable and alluring to think that expressing feelings would always result in a release of tension and a decline in violent conduct. In addition, expressing rage and violence physically or verbally may be gratifying, which is often why individuals believe it to be a workable option.
