Catharsis is the expressing of powerful emotions such as rage or hostility in order to unleash pent-up emotional energy. According to the notion of catharsis, expressing these sentiments makes people feel better and makes them less prone to participate in bad actions. There are two arguments for why catharsis practices often have the opposite intended effect: Aggressive conduct may be reinforced by expressing anger or aggressiveness, making it more likely to occur in the future. This may result in an increase rather than a reduction in negative conduct. Aggressiveness displacement: Expressing anger or animosity against a certain person or circumstance might result in the transference of that aggression onto other persons or situations. This may also lead to more bad conduct. One of the reasons why catharsis is popular is that it gives a straightforward and obvious explanation for why individuals engage in undesirable conduct. It is a simple method to explain why individuals participate in violent conduct, which may be difficult to grasp from a psychological standpoint. Furthermore, individuals often experience a feeling of relief after releasing their emotions, which might lead them to assume that catharsis is beneficial.
