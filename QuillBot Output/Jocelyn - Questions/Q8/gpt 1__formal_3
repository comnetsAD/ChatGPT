Catharsis is the release of pent-up emotional energy through expressing powerful emotions, such as wrath or aggressiveness. The notion of catharsis says that people would feel better and be less prone to engage in undesirable conduct after releasing their emotions. Two reasons explain why catharsis acts often have the opposite impact intended: Expressions of rage or violence may promote violent behavior, making it more likely to occur in the future. This might result in an increase in bad conduct, as opposed to a reduction. Transference of hostility: Expressing anger or aggressiveness toward a particular person or scenario might result in the displacement of that animosity onto other individuals or situations. This may also contribute to a rise in bad conduct. The concept of catharsis remains popular because it gives a straightforward and obvious explanation for why individuals engage in unpleasant conduct. It is simple to see why individuals participate in violent conduct, which might be tough to comprehend from a psychological standpoint. In addition, individuals typically feel relieved after releasing their feelings, leading them to assume that catharsis is successful.
