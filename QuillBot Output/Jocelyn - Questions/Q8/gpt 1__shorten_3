Anger and aggressiveness unleash pent-up emotional energy through catharsis. Catharsis shows that expressing these sentiments makes people feel better and less prone to act negatively. Catharsis typically backfires for two reasons: Violence reinforcement: Expressing anger or aggression might make it more likely to happen again. This may enhance bad conduct. Displacement of hostility: Expressing anger or aggressiveness toward one person or circumstance might cause it to be displaced onto others. Negative conduct may also rise. Catharsis' straightforward explanation for unpleasant conduct is why it's still popular. It simplifies the psychological reasons for violent conduct. After releasing their feelings, individuals may feel relieved and think catharsis works.
