The outpouring of suppressed emotions, such as rage or frustration, is known as catharsis. This is the belief that letting these feelings out into the open will provide some kind of emotional catharsis. Catharsis activities often have the opposite impact due to two factors: It's possible that the intensity or aggression of the cathartic activity may backfire, making the underlying anger or frustration worse. An increase in violent conduct may result from the release of pent-up emotions via cathartic activity because of a false feeling of superiority or approval. The notion of catharsis is widespread in part because it is easy to grasp and put into practice. In addition, catharsis is often depicted in the media and popular culture as a therapeutic method for overcoming distress. It's possible that this will convince some individuals that catharsis is a good approach to deal with their feelings. Recent studies, however, reveal that catharsis may not be as helpful as formerly assumed, and that healthy, constructive expression of emotions is preferable.
