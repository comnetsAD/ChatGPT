Aggression or violence release pent-up emotions through catharsis. Expressing these emotions reduces stress and anger. Catharsis typically backfires for two reasons: Cathartic acts may promote violent behavior, making it more likely to happen again. Arousal transfer: Aggressiveness in one context may raise arousal, which can increase aggression in other settings. Catharsis is still popular because it seems like an easy remedy to hostility and rage. It is simple to grasp and enticing to imagine that expressing feelings would instantaneously alleviate tension and reduce violent behavior. People believe it works because it's pleasurable to vent rage and fury physically or verbally.
