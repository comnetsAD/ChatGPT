The expressing of intense emotions, such as rage or hostility, may be cathartic for those who have been bottling up their emotions for a long time. The idea of catharsis proposes that when people express their emotions, they will not only feel better but also be less likely to participate in activities that are harmful to themselves or others. Two reasons as to why catharsis acts often have the opposite impact of what was intended are as follows: The expression of anger or hostility may encourage aggressive behavior, making it more likely to occur in the future and making the conduct more likely to occur in the first place. This may lead to more bad conduct rather than less, which is the opposite of what one would want for. The expression of anger or hostility against a particular individual or circumstance may result in the relocation of that hostility onto other individuals or circumstances, which is referred to as the "displacement of aggression." Additionally, this may result in an increase in undesirable behaviors. One reason why the concept of catharsis is still popular is because it offers an explanation that is straightforward and easy to comprehend for why individuals participate in activity that is harmful to themselves or others. It is a simple explanation for why individuals participate in violent conduct, which is something that, from a psychological point of view, may be difficult to comprehend. This explanation is straightforward. In addition, individuals often experience a sense of release after expressing their feelings, which might lead them to assume that the process of catharsis is successful.
