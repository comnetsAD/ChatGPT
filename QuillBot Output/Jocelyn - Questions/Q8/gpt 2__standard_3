Catharsis is the act of expressing or acting out pent-up emotions like rage or irritation. It is the notion that feeling these feelings and expressing them would bring about a sense of emotional relief or release. There are two reasons why catharsis acts often have the unintended consequence: Intense or forceful cathartic action might make people feel more angry or frustrated rather than relieved. A feeling of empowerment or affirmation that comes from cathartic action may promote aggression. Its simplicity and intuitive nature make it easier to comprehend and put into practice, which is one reason why the notion of catharsis is still so well-liked. In addition, catharsis is often presented in the media and in popular culture as a strategy for coping with unfavorable feelings. This could make some individuals think that catharsis is a good approach to control their emotions. Recent studies, however, raise the possibility that catharsis may not be as helpful as previously believed and that healthy, productive emotional expression is preferable to catharsis.
