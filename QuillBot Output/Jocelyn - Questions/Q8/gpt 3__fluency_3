Catharsis is the expression used to describe the release of pent-up emotions via acts or behaviors such as aggressiveness or violence. It is the belief that expressing these emotions helps diminish sentiments of hostility or wrath. There are two arguments for why catharsis practices often have the opposite intended effect: Aggressive behavior may be reinforced and perpetuated by engaging in cathartic activities, making it more likely to recur in the future. Arousal transfer occurs when aggressiveness is shown in one context and increases general arousal levels, which increases aggression in subsequent situations. One reason catharsis is still popular is because it seems to be a simple and clear solution to the issue of violence and fury. It's simple to comprehend, and it's tempting to imagine that expressing feelings would instantly result in a release of tension and a decrease in violent behavior. Furthermore, it may be pleasurable to vent rage and aggressiveness physically or verbally, which is why many individuals believe it is a good approach.
