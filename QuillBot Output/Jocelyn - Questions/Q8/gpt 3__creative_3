The term "catharsis" is used to describe the process of releasing suppressed feelings via behavior or action, such as hostility or violence. The notion is that letting these sentiments out into the open can help ease stress and lessen aggressive tendencies. Catharsis activities often have the opposite impact due to two factors: Cathartic activities may reward and sustain violent behavior, increasing the likelihood that it will occur again in the future. Aggressiveness in one setting may boost a person's degree of arousal and, in turn, their level of aggression in another. The concept of catharsis remains popular because it offers an apparently easy and direct solution to the issue of violence and wrath. It seems sense, and it's tempting to think that letting off steam would instantly relieve stress and calm down violent behavior. It's common for individuals to believe this is a viable option since it feels good to release pent-up emotions and rage via physical or verbal means.
