The lifeguard must first become aware that someone is in danger and need assistance. This may require seeing the distressed individual, hearing their screams for assistance, or being notified by another individual. The lifeguard must then swiftly analyze the situation to choose the most appropriate line of action. This may entail analyzing the individual's condition, calculating the danger to the lifeguard, and choosing the most effective rescue procedures. Decide to act: After assessing the situation, the lifeguard must determine whether or not to intervene. This choice may be influenced by the severity of the situation, the amount of danger to the lifeguard, and the availability of additional assistance. Utilize the rescue: If the lifeguard chooses to intervene, they must use the proper rescue tactics. This may require entering the water, employing rescue equipment, and administering first aid or cardiopulmonary resuscitation. After the rescue has been done, the lifeguard must analyze the result to see whether any medical or follow-up treatment is required. This might be because to a lack of confidence, fear, or any other impediment that keeps the lifeguard from acting.
