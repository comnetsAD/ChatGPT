The lifeguard must first notice an emergency. This may require seeing the distressed individual, hearing screams for aid, or being notified by someone. Analyze the scenario: The lifeguard must rapidly assess the situation to decide what to do. This may entail analyzing the person's health, lifeguard danger, and rescue methods. Activate: After assessing the situation, the lifeguard must decide to act. The severity of the situation, lifeguard danger, and resource availability may influence this choice. Save: This may need swimming, rescue equipment, and CPR. Evaluate the outcome: After the rescue, the lifeguard must decide whether further medical treatment is required. In all five phases, the lifeguard's unwillingness or inability to act, whether due to fear, insecurity, or other factors, keeps them from assisting.
