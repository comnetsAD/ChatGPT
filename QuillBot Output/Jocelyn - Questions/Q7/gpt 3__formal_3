The lifeguard must first become aware that someone is in danger and assistance is required. The lifeguard must perceive that the situation is urgent and that rapid action is necessary. Assume personal responsibility: The lifeguard must assume ownership of the circumstance and recognize that he or she is accountable for the result. The lifeguard must possess the skills and knowledge essential to give appropriate assistance. The lifeguard must physically intervene to assist the individual in danger. The characteristic shared by all five stages that would prevent the lifeguard from assisting the individual is a lack of cognitive engagement, which indicates that the lifeguard is not paying attention, is not recognizing the situation as an emergency, is not assuming personal responsibility, lacks the necessary skills or knowledge, or is unwilling to act. It is important to note that a lifeguard should have emergency response training and a clear, well-established strategy to follow in such situations.
