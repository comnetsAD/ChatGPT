Realize there's a problem: The lifeguard has to realize that someone is in trouble before he or she can do anything to aid. This might include seeing the person in need, hearing their calls for aid, or being notified by someone else. The lifeguard then has to immediately analyze the situation to figure out what to do next. To do so, the lifeguard may need to examine the victim's health, weigh the potential danger to themselves, and settle on a rescue strategy. Set your mind to it and take action: The lifeguard's next move depends on the results of their assessment. There are a number of elements that might go into making this decision, including the nature of the incident, the lifeguard's safety, and the accessibility of backup plans. Rescue operations, please: When a lifeguard chooses to intervene, they must use proper rescue procedures. Performing first aid or CPR may require entering the water and employing rescue equipment. After the rescue is over, the lifeguard must assess the situation to see whether any more medical attention or follow-up is required. The lack of desire or preparedness to act, whether from a lack of confidence, fear, or any other obstacle, is the one constant throughout all five phases that would prohibit the lifeguard from aiding that individual.
