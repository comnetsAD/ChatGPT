A lifeguard's first step in responding to a situation in which assistance is required is to become aware that such a situation exists. The lifeguard has to take the issue seriously and respond quickly, thus they must treat it as an emergency. The lifeguard has to realize that they have control over the outcome of the incident and act accordingly. The lifeguard's job is to aid those in need, thus they need to know how to do it. The lifeguard must immediately take action and physically rescue the victim. The lack of cognitive engagement is a feature shared by all five stages that would prevent the lifeguard from helping the person in need, which means that he or she is either not paying attention, not recognizing the situation as an emergency, not taking responsibility, not having the necessary skills or knowledge, or is unwilling to take action. It's important to note that a lifeguard has to be prepared to respond to emergencies and follow a set procedure.
