The lifeguard must first become aware that someone is in trouble and requires assistance, therefore take note of the situation. This can include seeing the distressed individual, hearing their screams for assistance, or receiving a warning from another person. The lifeguard must then make a fast assessment of the situation to decide the best course of action. This may include analyzing the individual's condition, weighing the danger to the lifeguard, and selecting the most suitable rescue methods. Take action: The lifeguard must then determine whether or not to take action after evaluating the scenario. The importance of the emergency, the danger to the lifeguard, and the accessibility of alternative services may all play a role in this choice. Execute the rescue: If the lifeguard chooses to take action, they must then put the proper rescue methods into practice. This might include diving into the water, utilizing rescue tools, and doing CPR or first aid. After the rescue is complete, the lifeguard must assess the results and decide if any extra medical attention or follow-up treatment is required. The lack of desire or readiness to act, which might be caused by a lack of confidence, fear, or any other obstacle that keeps the lifeguard from acting, is a prevalent trait throughout all five phases that would prohibit the lifeguard from aiding that individual.
