Become aware of the emergency The first step for the lifeguard is to become aware that someone is in danger and need assistance. This may entail seeing the person who is in danger, listening for calls for assistance, or being informed of the situation by another individual. Conduct a scenario analysis The next step for the lifeguard is to conduct a situation analysis as rapidly as possible in order to establish the appropriate next step. This may entail diagnosing the person's condition, estimating the level of danger posed to the lifeguard, and selecting the most effective methods for the rescue. Decide to act: After making an assessment of the circumstance, the lifeguard is required to determine whether or not they will take any action. This choice may be influenced by a variety of considerations, including the gravity of the situation, the degree of danger posed to the lifeguard, and the accessibility of additional resources. Carry out the rescue operation: In the event that the lifeguard chooses to take action, they will be required to carry out the necessary rescue procedures. This may include getting into the water, using rescue equipment, and administering first aid or cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR). Evaluate the result: Once the rescue operation is through, the lifeguard is tasked with evaluating the outcome and determining whether or not the victim requires further medical attention or follow-up treatment. The lack of willingness or readiness to act is the one trait that is shared by all five stages and is the factor that prevents the lifeguard from helping the person in need. This lack of willingness or readiness could be due to a lack of self-assurance, fear, or any other barrier that prevents the lifeguard from acting.
