Take note of the event: The lifeguard must first be aware that someone is in danger and that assistance is required. Consider the situation to be an emergency: The lifeguard must understand that the situation is severe and that quick action is necessary. Take personal accountability: The lifeguard must take ownership of the situation and accept responsibility for the result. Know how to assist: The lifeguard must have the required abilities and expertise to aid others. Take action: The lifeguard must intervene physically to assist the individual in danger. The lack of cognitive engagement is the common characteristic across all 5 stages that would prevent the lifeguard from assisting that person. This means that the lifeguard is not paying attention, not recognizing the situation as an emergency, not assuming personal responsibility, not having the necessary skills or knowledge, or not being willing to take action. A lifeguard should be trained in emergency response and have a clear and well-established process to follow in such situations.
