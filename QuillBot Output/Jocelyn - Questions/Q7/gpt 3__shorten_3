The lifeguard must first notice that someone needs aid. The lifeguard must detect the emergency and respond immediately. Take accountability: The lifeguard must accept responsibility for the result. Lifeguards must know how to aid. Act: The lifeguard must personally assist the victim. The lifeguard cannot assist that individual if they are not cognitively engaged, which implies they are not paying attention, not recognizing the emergency, not taking personal responsibility, not having the skills or knowledge, or not wanting to act. Lifeguards should be trained in emergency response and follow a defined procedure.
