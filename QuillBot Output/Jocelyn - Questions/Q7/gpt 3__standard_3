The lifeguard must first become aware that someone is in danger and that assistance is required. The lifeguard must understand that the situation is severe and that quick action is needed. Treat the incident as an emergency. Personal accountability: The lifeguard has to recognize their role for the result and take ownership of the issue. Know how to assist: The lifeguard must possess the abilities and information required to provide suitable aid. Take action: To assist the individual in need, the lifeguard must physically step in. Lack of cognitive engagement—which means the lifeguard is not paying attention, not recognizing the situation as an emergency, not assuming personal responsibility, lacking the necessary skills or knowledge, or not being willing to take action—is the characteristic shared by all five stages that would prevent the lifeguard from assisting that person. It's important to note that a lifeguard should have received training in emergency response and have a defined procedure to follow in such circumstances.
