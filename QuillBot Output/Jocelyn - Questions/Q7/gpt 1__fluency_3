Recognize the emergency: The lifeguard must first recognize that someone is in danger and need assistance. This might include observing the person in difficulty, hearing screams for assistance, or being notified by another individual. Examine the scenario: The lifeguard must next assess the situation immediately in order to choose the best course of action. This may include analyzing the person's condition, identifying the danger to the lifeguard, and selecting the best rescue procedures. Decide to take action: After assessing the situation, the lifeguard must determine whether or not to intervene. The severity of the situation, the amount of danger to the lifeguard, and the availability of additional services may all influence this choice. Execute the rescue: If the lifeguard chooses to intervene, they must use the necessary rescue procedures. This might include entering the water, employing rescue equipment, and administering first aid or CPR. Evaluate the result: Once the rescue has been performed, the lifeguard must assess the outcome and decide if extra medical or follow-up treatment is required. The lack of desire or readiness to act, which might be due to a lack of confidence, fear, or any other obstacle that keeps the lifeguard from acting, is a consistent trait throughout all five phases that would hinder the lifeguard from assisting that individual.
