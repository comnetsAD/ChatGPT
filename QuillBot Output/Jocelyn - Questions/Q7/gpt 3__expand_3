The lifeguard must first become aware that someone is in danger and that assistance is required in order to do their job properly. Consider the occurrence to be an emergency. The lifeguard has a responsibility to acknowledge that the situation is severe and that quick action is necessary. Assume personal responsibility: The lifeguard is the one who has to step up and acknowledge that they are the one who is ultimately accountable for the result of the event. Know how to help: The lifeguard is expected to have the knowledge and abilities essential to assist those in need in a safe and effective manner. It is necessary for the lifeguard to take action and physically assist the individual who is in danger. The lack of cognitive engagement is the characteristic that is shared by all five stages and is the factor that would prevent the lifeguard from helping the person in need. This means that the lifeguard is not paying attention, does not recognize the situation as an emergency, does not assume personal responsibility, does not have the necessary skills or knowledge, or is unwilling to take action. It is important to note that a lifeguard has to be educated in how to respond to emergencies and should also have a clear and well-established procedure to follow in these kinds of situations.
