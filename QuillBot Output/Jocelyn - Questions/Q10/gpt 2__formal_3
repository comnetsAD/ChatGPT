One cause for conformity is the desire to belong and be accepted by a group. People often adopt the ideas, attitudes, and actions of a group in order to be recognized as a member of that group and to avoid social exclusion or rejection. Also contributing to conformity is the impact of authoritative figures. People often seek to persons in positions of power or authority for knowledge and direction, and they may adopt their views and habits in order to win acceptance or escape punishment. The urge to blend in with and be accepted by a group exists regardless of knowledge uncertainty. People tend to comply more when they are in bigger groups since the demand to conform grows with group size. People prefer to comply more when they feel that everyone in the group agrees, since the urge to conform rises when apparent consensus exists. Public replies tend to be more conforming than private ones because the urge to comply rises when others can see or hear comments.
