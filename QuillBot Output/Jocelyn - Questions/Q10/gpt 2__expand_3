One of the reasons why individuals conform is due to their desire to be accepted and integrated into a group that they are a part of. People often adhere to the views, attitudes, and actions of a group in order to be regarded as a member of that group and to avoid being rejected or socially isolated from the group. This is done in an effort to prevent social ostracism. One further explanation for why individuals comply is because of the influence of those in positions of power. People frequently look to those in positions of power or authority as sources of information and guidance, and they may conform to the beliefs and behaviors of those in authority in order to gain approval or avoid being punished. This is because people often believe that those in positions of power or authority know best. The desire to belong to and be accepted by a group is a constant human emotion that exists independently of the clarity of the information. Size of the group: People have a tendency to comply more when they are in bigger groups since the demand to conform grows as the number of people in the group increases. Unanimity: People have a tendency to conform more when they think that others in the group are in agreement. This is because the temptation to comply rises when there is apparent consensus, and unanimity encourages people to conform more. People have a tendency to comply more when their comments are offered publicly, since the pressure to conform rises when others can see or hear their responses. In contrast, people are less likely to conform when their responses are delivered privately.
