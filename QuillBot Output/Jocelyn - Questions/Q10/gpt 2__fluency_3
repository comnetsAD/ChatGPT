One of the reasons individuals conform is a desire to fit in and be accepted by a group. People often adhere to a group's views, attitudes, and actions in order to be recognized as a member of that group and avoid rejection or social ostracism. The influence of authoritative individuals is another reason why people comply. People often seek to persons in positions of power or authority for information and advice, and they may adapt to their ideas and habits to win acceptance or escape punishment. The desire to fit in and be accepted by a group is a factor that arises regardless of knowledge uncertainty. Members tend to comply more in bigger groups because the urge to conform grows with the number of people in the group. Unanimity: When people think that others in the group are in agreement, the urge to comply grows, and people tend to conform more. People tend to comply more when their comments are presented publicly, since the pressure to conform rises when others can see or hear them.
