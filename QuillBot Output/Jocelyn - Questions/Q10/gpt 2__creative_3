Individuals will frequently adopt the values and norms of a group in an effort to be accepted by its members and to prevent themselves from being marginalized or excluded from it. Influence from those in positions of power is another cause of conformity. To win acceptance or escape punishment, followers may adopt the views and practices of individuals in authoritative positions. The need to belong in a group and be accepted by its members is a constant that exists independently of any uncertainty in the available knowledge. The urge to conform grows with the size of a group, therefore individuals are more likely to do so in bigger groups. When there is apparent unanimity amongst a group of people, the pressure to conform grows, and people are more likely to comply as a result. People are more likely to comply when their replies are being seen by others than when they are being delivered in solitude.
