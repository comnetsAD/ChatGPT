People conform for a variety of reasons, the most common of which are the hopes of gaining social approval and the conviction that the norms, beliefs, and practices of the group are superior. No matter how unclear the facts may be, people will always have the need to fit in with their peers. Conformity may be influenced by many variables, including the size of the group, whether or not everyone in the group agrees with the leader, and whether or not the leader exudes confidence. The term "group size" refers to the number of people who are a part of the group, "unanimity" describes the degree to which all members of the group are in agreement with one another, and "the presence of a confident leader or authority figure" describes the perceived level of expertise or status of the person who is in charge of the group.
