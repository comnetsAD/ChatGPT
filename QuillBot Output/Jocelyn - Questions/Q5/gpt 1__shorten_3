The basic attribution fallacy is attributing others' conduct to their personality or disposition rather than environmental causes. People prefer to ascribe others' conduct to internal elements like personality, character, or ability rather than external variables like the circumstance or environment. Fundamental attribution mistake has three basic causes: Self-interest: People regard themselves as more complicated and multi-faceted than others and ascribe their conduct to situational conditions. This bias makes individuals ascribe others' actions to internal variables and their own to external circumstances. Availability heuristic: People prefer to choose the easiest information and ignore other pertinent information. Overreliance on dispositional explanations for behavior may result. Confirmation bias: People seek and interpret evidence to confirm their views and attitudes. This may bias people's behavior to dispositional rather than environmental influences. The basic attribution mistake is a cognitive bias that causes individuals to misinterpret others' actions by attributing it to internal rather than external circumstances.
