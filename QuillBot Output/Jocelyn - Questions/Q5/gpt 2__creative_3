The basic attribution fallacy is the propensity for individuals to attribute the actions of others to their own intrinsic features or characteristics, while attributing their own actions to external circumstances. There are three explanations for this observation: Individuals have a tendency toward attributing others' actions to their innate personality traits while attributing greater impact to environmental variables in their own. To attribute one's actions to uncontrollable forces is more convenient, since it removes the burden of personal accountability. Very little is known: It is common for people to attribute others' actions to their character traits without having a complete picture of the circumstances. Due to confirmation bias, individuals are more likely to give weight to data that backs up their own opinions and worldviews, rather than examining other explanations for people's actions. In conclusion, self-serving prejudice, restricted knowledge, and confirmation bias may all contribute to the basic attribution mistake, in which individuals explain the actions of others in terms of their own dispositions while attributing their own actions to external reasons.
