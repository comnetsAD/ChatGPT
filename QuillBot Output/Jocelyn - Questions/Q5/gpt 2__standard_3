The basic attribution mistake is the propensity for individuals to attribute personality characteristics or internal dispositions to the conduct of others while attributing situational circumstances or external causes to their own behavior. There are three causes for this phenomenon: Self-serving bias: People often believe that their own conduct is more impacted by external circumstances than that of others, who, in contrast, believe that behavior is more influenced by innate traits. This is due to the fact that seeing one's own conduct as being driven by other forces absolves them of accountability and is more self-serving. limited knowledge People often have little knowledge of the circumstances and context behind another person's conduct, which might cause them to infer negative things about the person's character. Confirmation bias is the tendency for people to concentrate on information that supports their preexisting opinions and attitudes about other people. This may cause individuals to interpret other people's conduct as a reflection of their innate traits rather than taking situational considerations into account. In conclusion, the basic attribution mistake is the propensity for individuals to explain their own conduct in terms of external variables while attributing the behavior of others to internal tendencies. This may be caused by self-serving bias, a lack of knowledge, or confirmation bias.
