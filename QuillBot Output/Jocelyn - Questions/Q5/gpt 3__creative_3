The basic attribution fallacy is the common tendency to credit another person's conduct to their own intrinsic qualities, such personality or temperament, rather than to contextual effects like environment. There are three causes for this: The self-serving bias occurs when an individual has a more favorable impression of themselves than they do of others, leading them to ascribe their own actions to external causes and those of others to internal causes. When forming snap judgements on others, we often use just the information that is readily accessible to us, such as our preconceived notions or first impressions. People have a tendency to seek out and interpret information in a manner that supports their current views and attitudes, a phenomenon known as confirmation bias. This may cause people to fail to see exogenous influences that may be influencing the actions of others around them. As a whole, humans are prone to making the basic attribution mistake, a kind of cognitive bias in which they incorrectly attribute cause to traits rather than circumstances.
