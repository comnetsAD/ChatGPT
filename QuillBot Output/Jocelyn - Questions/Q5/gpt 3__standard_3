A phenomena known as the basic attribution mistake occurs when individuals prefer to blame other people's actions on their own internal traits, such as personality or temperament, rather than outside effects, such as environmental influences. There are three causes for this phenomenon: Self-serving bias: Since people tend to see themselves more favorably than others, they prefer to blame external causes for their own conduct and internal ones for that of others. The availability heuristic states that when forming opinions about others, people often depend on the information that is most readily accessible to them, such as stereotypes or initial impressions. Confirmation bias is the tendency for people to seek out and interpret data in a manner that supports their current views and attitudes, which may cause them to ignore other influences that could be influencing other people's behavior. In general, the basic attribution mistake is a widespread cognitive bias that causes individuals to overestimate the importance of dispositional variables in explaining behavior while underestimating the importance of situational elements.
