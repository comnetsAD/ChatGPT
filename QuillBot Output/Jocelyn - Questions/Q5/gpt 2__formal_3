The basic attribution fallacy is the propensity for individuals to explain the conduct of others in terms of internal dispositions or personality qualities, but they explain their own behavior in terms of external circumstances or situational variables. There are three causes for this phenomenon: Self-serving bias: People tend to see their own conduct as being more affected by situational conditions, but they perceive the behavior of others as being more influenced by their underlying inclinations. This is due to the fact that it is more advantageous to consider one's action as being driven by other forces, since it absolves them of responsibility. little data available: People often have inadequate knowledge on the context and circumstances surrounding the behavior of others, which might cause them to make assumptions about the individual's fundamental proclivities. Confirmation bias: People have a tendency to concentrate on information that confirms their previous views and attitudes about others, which may cause them to perceive the actions of others as a reflection of their fundamental dispositions rather than taking situational considerations into account. In conclusion, the fundamental attribution error refers to the tendency for individuals to attribute the behavior of others to internal dispositions while explaining their own behavior in terms of external factors. This can be the result of self-serving bias, limited information, or confirmation bias.
