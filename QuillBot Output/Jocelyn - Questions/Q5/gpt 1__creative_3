Assuming that other people's actions can be explained by their character traits rather than external influences is an example of the basic attribution fallacy. It's the tendency to credit someone else's actions to their intrinsic qualities, like their personality or character, rather than to the external variables, such the circumstances in which they occurred. The basic attribution mistake often arises due to three primary causes: Disparate treatment: The human tendency to see oneself as more nuanced and multifaceted than others and to ascribe one's own conduct to exogenous causes is well-established. As a result of this bias, individuals tend to blame internal rather than external sources for their own actions. The availability heuristic is the human tendency to focus on, and act upon, the most immediately accessible information to the exclusion of other, perhaps more pertinent data. This may cause people to put too much stock on innate character traits as the cause of behavior. To put it simply, people have a tendency to seek out and interpret information in a manner that reinforces their own views and attitudes. This might provide a skewed view of other people's actions, with the cause being assumed to be their character traits rather than external circumstances. When individuals incorrectly ascribe the actions of others to their own internal motivations rather than the circumstances around them, they are engaging in a cognitive bias known as the basic attribution mistake.
