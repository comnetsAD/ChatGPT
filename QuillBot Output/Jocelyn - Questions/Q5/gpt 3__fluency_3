The basic attribution fallacy is a phenomena in which individuals prefer to ascribe other people's actions to internal attributes like personality or disposition rather than external causes like environmental circumstances. This phenomena arises for three reasons: Self-serving bias: Because people tend to see themselves more positively than others, they ascribe their own conduct to external influences while attributing the behavior of others to internal ones. When forming judgements about others, people prefer to depend on the information that is most readily accessible to them, such as stereotypes or initial impressions. Confirmation bias occurs when people seek for and interpret information that supports their previous views and attitudes, which might cause them to miss external influences that may be influencing the behavior of others. Overall, the basic attribution mistake is a widespread cognitive bias that causes individuals to underestimate the relevance of situational circumstances in explaining behavior while overestimating the impact of dispositional factors.
