People have a tendency to ascribe the conduct of others to internal attributes, such as personality or temperament, as opposed to external effects, such as situational impacts. There are three causes for this phenomenon: People tend to regard themselves in a more favorable light than others, therefore they ascribe their own conduct to external circumstances while attributing the behavior of others to internal causes. When forming judgements about others, people prefer to depend on the information that is most readily accessible to them, such as stereotypes or initial impressions. Confirmation bias: People have a tendency to seek out and interpret information in a manner that confirms their previous views and attitudes, leading them to miss external influences that may be influencing the behavior of others. In general, the basic attribution mistake is a cognitive bias that causes individuals to underestimate the impact of situational events and overestimate the relevance of dispositional factors in explaining behavior.
