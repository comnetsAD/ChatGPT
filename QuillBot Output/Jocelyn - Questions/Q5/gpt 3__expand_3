People have a tendency to ascribe the conduct of others to internal attributes, such as personality or disposition, rather than external causes, such as environmental impacts. This phenomenon is referred to as the basic attribution mistake (or simply "the error"). This phenomena arises for three causes, which are as follows: People have a tendency to regard themselves in a more favorable light than others, which leads them to ascribe their own conduct to external circumstances while attributing the behavior of others to internal ones. This is an example of the self-serving bias. When forming opinions about other people, people have a tendency to base such opinions on the information that is most readily accessible to them, such as preconceived notions or first impressions. This is known as the availability heuristic. People have a tendency to seek out and interpret information in a manner that supports their already-held views and attitudes, which may cause them to miss external influences that may be impacting the behavior of others. This phenomenon is known as confirmation bias. People are prone to making the basic attribution mistake, which is a typical cognitive bias that causes them to underestimate the importance that situational circumstances play in explaining behavior and overestimate the part that dispositional factors play in doing so.
