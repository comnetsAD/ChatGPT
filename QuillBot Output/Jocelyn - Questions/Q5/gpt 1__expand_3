An individual is making the basic attribution mistake when they have a propensity to ascribe the conduct of other people to aspects of their underlying nature or proclivities rather than to characteristics that are influenced by the circumstances in which they find themselves. It takes place when individuals have a tendency to ascribe the conduct of others to internal elements such as personality, character, or ability, rather than attributing the behavior to external variables such as the circumstance or the environment. There are three primary causes that contribute to the occurrence of the basic attribution error: Bias motivated by self-interest: People have a tendency to see themselves as more complicated and multi-faceted than others, and they have a tendency to ascribe their own conduct to elements that are influenced by the circumstances in which they find themselves. Because of this bias, individuals are more likely to ascribe the conduct of others to internal variables, while they credit their own behavior to external ones. People have a tendency to depend on the information that is most readily accessible to them, and they have a tendency to miss other information that could be crucial to comprehending a situation. This is referred to as the availability heuristic. This might cause one to place an excessive amount of stock in dispositional explanations for behavior. People have a tendency to search for and interpret information in a manner that supports their already views and attitudes. This is known as confirmation bias. This may lead to a bias in reading the conduct of other people and attributing it to dispositional variables rather than situational circumstances.

The fundamental attribution error is a cognitive bias that occurs when people have a tendency to attribute the behavior of others to internal factors rather than external factors, and this bias leads to misunderstandings and misinterpretations of people's behavior. In general, the fundamental attribution error can be defined as the following:
