The basic attribution mistake occurs when individuals attribute others' conduct to internal dispositions or personality characteristics and their own behavior to external circumstances or situational variables. Three causes: Self-serving bias: People tend to regard their own conduct as more affected by environmental conditions and others as more influenced by their underlying tendencies. It's self-serving to blame external circumstances for one's actions since it absolves them of accountability. Unknown: People frequently make assumptions about others' dispositions due to a lack of context and scenario. Confirmation bias: People concentrate on information that supports their opinions and attitudes about others, which might cause them to see others' actions as a reflection of their fundamental dispositions rather than environmental considerations. In conclusion, self-serving bias, limited knowledge, and confirmation bias cause individuals to ascribe others' conduct to internal inclinations while attributing their own behavior to external circumstances.
