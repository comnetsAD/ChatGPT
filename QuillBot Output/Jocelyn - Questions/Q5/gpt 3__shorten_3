The basic attribution mistake occurs when individuals ascribe others' conduct to internal attributes like personality or temperament rather than external variables like environmental effects. Three causes are: Self-serving bias: Because people perceive themselves positively, they ascribe their own conduct to external sources and others' to internal ones. Availability heuristic: People use stereotypes and early perceptions to judge people. Confirmation bias: People prefer to seek out and interpret information that supports their views and attitudes, which might cause them to miss other influences that may be shaping others' behavior. The basic attribution mistake is a prevalent cognitive bias that causes individuals to underestimate situational elements and overestimate dispositional ones in explaining behavior.
