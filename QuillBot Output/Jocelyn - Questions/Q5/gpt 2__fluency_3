The basic attribution mistake refers to people's tendency to explain other people's conduct in terms of internal dispositions or personality qualities, while explaining their own behavior in terms of external circumstances or situational variables. This phenomena arises for three reasons: Self-serving bias: People tend to believe that their own conduct is more impacted by environmental conditions, but others' behavior is more influenced by their underlying tendencies. This is because seeing one's own conduct as driven by other causes is more self-serving, since it absolves them of responsibility. Information is scarce: People often have insufficient knowledge about the context and scenario surrounding other people's conduct, which might cause them to make assumptions about the person's fundamental tendencies. Confirmation bias occurs when people concentrate on information that supports their previous views and attitudes about others, which may cause them to interpret other people's actions as a reflection of their underlying dispositions rather than examining situational considerations. In essence, the basic attribution mistake refers to people's inclination to ascribe other people's conduct to inherent dispositions while explaining their own behavior in terms of external variables. This might be due to self-serving bias, insufficient knowledge, or confirmation bias.
