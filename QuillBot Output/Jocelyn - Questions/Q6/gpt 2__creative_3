Giving something to the customer in exchange for their cooperation, such as a free trial or a discount. Offering a complimentary service package or a discount on repairs might help move that old beater. Social exchange theory describes the mental process that goes into using this method. The concept of "social proof," or allowing one's conduct to be influenced by the acts or views of others, has been around for a while. By emphasizing the satisfaction of former buyers or presenting testimonials, you may be able to sell even a used car in poor condition. Normative social influence describes the mental mechanism at work in this tactic. Scarcity is the practice of making a product or opportunity seem more desirable than it really is by emphasizing its limited supply. By highlighting the scarcity of comparable vehicles at the asking price, this strategy might help sell an old beater. This tactic relies on the "scarcity principle," a psychological phenomenon that may be traced back to its implementation. One way to persuade others to do what you want them to is by establishing your authority as a reliable or knowledgeable source. Offering a professional examination or certification may help sell that beat-up old car. The concept of authority describes the underlying psychological mechanism of this tactic. Although the aforementioned tactics are useful for increasing conformity, scarcity (by creating an impression of limited availability) and authority (by offering a professional examination or certification) may be more successful when trying to unload a junker vehicle.
