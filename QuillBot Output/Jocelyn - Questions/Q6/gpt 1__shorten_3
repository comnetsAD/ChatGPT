Reciprocity: Offering a free trial or discount for compliance. Offering a free inspection or a discount on a future purchase might sell an old clunker. This method induces reciprocation. Scarcity: Stressing an item's scarcity to create urgency. Emphasizing that an antique clunker is uncommon and cheap might help sell it. Scarcity motivates this method. Social proof: Showing that others have accepted a request. Testimonials from delighted customers may help sell an old clunker. This technique uses social proof. Commitment and consistency: Asking for a tiny pledge before asking for complete compliance, then reminding them of their earlier commitment. To sell an old clunker, get the customer to test drive it and then remind them how much they enjoyed it and how it fulfilled their requirements. Commitment and constancy underlie this method.
