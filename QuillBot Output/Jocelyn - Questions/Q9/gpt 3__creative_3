Leaders may exert influence on their staff in a number of ways, and these methods can be grouped into many broad categories. The use of force or threats to exert influence is an example of a coercive power technique. Consequences, violence, and the withholding of benefits are all forms of coercive authority. The employment of incentives or prizes as a means of exerting influence is known as "reward power techniques." Bonuses, promotions, and other types of positive reinforcement are examples of reward power strategies. Using official or lawful authority to influence others is an example of a legitimate power approach. Using official titles or positions of authority, such as delivering orders, establishing rules and procedures, and making decisions, are all examples of legitimate power techniques. The use of one's knowledge, ability, or competence to exert influence over others is a method known as "expert power." Expert power strategies include the provision of information, the resolution of issues, and the provision of suggestions. Referent power strategies entail influencing people with endearing or trustworthy qualities about oneself. Referent power strategies include connection building, displaying real interest in others, and persuading people to follow in one's footsteps. The use of information as a tool for persuasion is an example of a method known as "informational power." As examples of informational power strategies, we may cite the use of statistics, data, and hard proof to back up claims.
