The push/pull methodology is a strategy that is used in the field of psychology to explore the underlying motives and desires that are responsible for driving behavior. It is predicated on the concept that people have evolved to have certain intrinsic drives or motives, such as the desire for food or the desire to feel secure. The push-pull method is used to evaluate an individual's preferences by seeing how rapidly they are willing to push or pull a joystick in reaction to a variety of stimuli. These stimuli may include pictures of food or pictures of potential threats. If participants press the experimental word "cake" quicker than they push the neutral word "window" using the joystick, this indicates that the term "cake" elicits a greater positive emotional response and a higher drive to approach it. It gives the impression that the term "cake" is linked to an end that one would want to achieve, such as joy or contentment. The fact that the respondent moved toward the word "cake" with a greater degree of urgency implies that they place a higher priority on it in terms of their needs and wishes.
