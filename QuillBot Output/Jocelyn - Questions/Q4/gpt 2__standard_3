The push/pull strategy is based on the idea that, in order to live and prosper, people have evolved to react rapidly and effectively to various stimuli. The push/pull strategy is based on the notion that certain stimuli, such as those connected to food or danger, would prompt a greater and quicker reaction than neutral ones. This is due to the need of fast reactions to threats and food throughout the early stages of our evolutionary history. People may establish a greater positive association with the word "cake" than with the word "window" if they press the experimental word "cake" with the joystick more quickly than the neutral word "window." This is owing to the fact that the experimental term elicited a higher emotional reaction with the quicker response time, most likely as a result of the positive connection with eating. It could also imply that the term "cake" connotes more reward or pleasure than the neutral word "window."
