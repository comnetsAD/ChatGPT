Humans, in order to live and prosper, have evolved to react rapidly and effectively to specific stimuli, and this is the evolutionary logic for the push/pull method. The theory behind the push/pull method is that stimuli with more salience (e.g., those linked with food or danger) would evoke a more intense and rapid reaction than neutral ones. For one thing, being fast to react to food and danger would have been crucial to our survival in our evolutionary past. For example, if the experimental word "cake" is pushed with the joystick at a higher rate than the neutral term "window," it would indicate that individuals associate the former more positively with the latter. Due to the positive connotation with food, a quicker reaction time suggests a higher emotional response to the experimental term. It may also imply that "cake" is a more pleasurable or rewarding term than "window," which is more neutral.
