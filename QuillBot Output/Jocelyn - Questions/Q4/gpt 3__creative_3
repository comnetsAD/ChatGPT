The push/pull method is predicated on the theory that humans have evolved to respond more quickly and effectively to certain stimuli. Such cues are associated with basic needs, such as food or threats to safety. This method is predicated on the idea that, due to their importance for human survival during evolution, certain stimuli will evoke a stronger and quicker response than neutral ones. A higher positive association with the experimental word "cake" than the neutral word "window" would be shown if participants used the joystick to push "cake" quicker than "window." This is because a more intense emotional response to the experimental word—possibly because of the word's link with food—is indicated by a quicker reaction time. It may also suggest that "cake" is more positively connected with positive emotions than the more neutral "window."
