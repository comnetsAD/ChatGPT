The concept of people having a quicker and more effective reaction to particular stimuli is the foundation of the push-and-pull approach. A survival-related stimulus may be anything like food or a potential threat. This strategy is predicated on the notion that specific stimuli would evoke a greater and quicker response than neutral stimuli, due to the fact that this trait was essential to human survival over the course of our evolutionary history. If participants use the joystick to press the experimental word "cake" quicker than they push the neutral word "window," it indicates that they have a greater positive association with the word "cake" than they do with the word "window." This is the case owing to the fact that a quicker reaction time is a sign of a higher emotional response to the experimental term, which might be attributable to the word's connection with food. It's also possible that this means people link the term "cake" with more pleasure or reward than they do the word "window," which is neutral.
