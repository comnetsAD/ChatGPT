Humans have evolved to react fast and effectively to particular stimuli to live and prosper, thus the push/pull strategy. The push/pull strategy assumes that food and danger-related cues would evoke a greater and quicker reaction than neutral ones. Because our ancestors needed to react swiftly to food and danger. Using the joystick, participants push the experimental word "cake" quicker than the neutral word "window," indicating a higher positive association with "cake." Due to the positive connection with food, the quicker reaction time implies a higher emotional response to the experimental term. It may also indicate that "cake" is more pleasurable than "window".
