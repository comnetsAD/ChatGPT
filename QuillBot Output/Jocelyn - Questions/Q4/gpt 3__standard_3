The push/pull method is based on the evolutionary hypothesis that humans respond to certain stimuli more quickly and effectively than other animals. These cues, like food or danger, are vital to life. This method is predicated on the idea that certain stimuli would cause a greater and quicker response than neutral stimuli since it was crucial for survival in our evolutionary past. People may develop a greater positive association with the word "cake" than the word "window" if they press the experimental word "cake" on the joystick more quickly than the unrelated word "window." This is owing to the fact that a quicker reaction time indicates a higher emotional response to the experimental term, which may be caused by its link with food. It may also mean that the term "cake" has a stronger connotation of reward or pleasure than the neutral word "window."
