The push/pull technique's evolutionary logic is that humans have evolved to react fast and effectively to particular stimuli in order to live and prosper. The push/pull strategy is based on the premise that cues linked with food or danger evoke a greater and quicker reaction than neutral ones. This is because, in our evolutionary past, the capacity to react swiftly to food and danger was critical for survival. If, using the joystick, users push the experimental word "cake" quicker than the neutral word "window", it shows that they have a greater positive association with the word "cake" than with the word "window". This is owing to the fact that a quicker reaction time reflects a higher emotional response to the experimental term, which is most likely related to the positive connection with eating. It might also imply that the term "cake" is connected with greater pleasure or reward than the neutral word "window".
