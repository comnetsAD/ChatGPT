The push/pull strategy is based on the evolutionary premise that people respond to particular stimuli more quickly and efficiently. Such cues, such as food or danger, are associated to survival. Because it was vital for survival in our evolutionary past, this strategy is predicated on the notion that specific stimuli would evoke a stronger and quicker response than neutral ones. If participants use the joystick to press the experimental word "cake" quicker than the neutral word "window", it suggests that they have a stronger positive association with the word "cake" than the word "window". This is owing to the fact that a quicker reaction time indicates a higher emotional response to the experimental term, which might be linked to its connection with food. It might also imply that the term "cake" is connected with greater pleasure or reward than the neutral word "window".
