The push/pull approach is based on the premise that humans have evolved to react fast and effectively to certain stimuli in order to live and prosper. The push/pull approach is predicated on the theory that particular stimuli, such as those linked with food or danger, would evoke a stronger and more rapid reaction than neutral ones. In our evolutionary past, the capacity to react rapidly to food and danger would have been essential for survival. People develop a higher positive association with the word "cake" than with the neutral word "window" if they press the experimental word "cake" with the joystick quicker than the neutral word "window." This is because a quicker reaction time suggests a higher emotional response to the experimental term, most likely as a result of the word's positive connection with eating. It may also imply that the term "cake" is connected with more pleasure or reward than the neutral word "window."
