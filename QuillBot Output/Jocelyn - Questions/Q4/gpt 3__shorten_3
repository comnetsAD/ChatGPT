The push/pull strategy is based on the evolutionary premise that people respond quicker and more efficiently to particular stimuli. Food and danger are survival cues. Since survival was vital in our evolutionary history, some stimuli would evoke a stronger and quicker response than neutral ones. People develop a higher positive connection with the experimental word "cake" than the neutral word "window" if they push it quicker with the joystick. The quicker reaction time indicates a higher emotional response to the experimental term, which may be related to eating. It may also suggest that "cake" is more pleasurable than "window".
