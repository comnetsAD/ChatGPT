The idea that humans have evolved to react rapidly and effectively to many stimuli in order to live and prosper is the evolutionary argument that behind the push/pull approach. The push-and-pull strategy is predicated on the concept that particular stimuli, such as those linked with food or danger, would evoke a more robust and speedier reaction than neutral stimuli will. This is due to the fact that during the course of our evolutionary history, the capacity to react rapidly to both food and potential threats would have been essential for survival. If participants press the experimental word "cake" quicker than they push the neutral word "window" with the joystick, this indicates that they have a greater positive association with the word "cake" than they do with the term "window." This is the case owing to the fact that a quicker reaction time reflects a higher emotional response to the experimental term, most likely as a result of the positive connection with food. It's also possible that this indicates that the term "cake" is connected with more pleasure or reward than the word "window," which is neutral.
