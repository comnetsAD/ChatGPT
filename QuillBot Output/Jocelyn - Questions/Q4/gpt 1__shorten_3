Psychology uses the push/pull methodology to explore behavioral motives. It assumes people have evolved to want food and safety. The push/pull method measures how rapidly a person pushes or pulls a joystick in reaction to various cues, such as food or threat. When using the joystick, respondents push the experimental word "cake" quicker than the neutral term "window," indicating a more positive emotional response and drive to approach it. It implies that "cake" means joy or fulfillment. The person's quicker response to "cake" implies that it's more important to them.
