The push/pull approach is based on the evolutionary theory that people have a more rapid and effective reaction to certain stimuli. These cues are survival-related, such as food or danger. This strategy is predicated on the premise that specific stimuli would evoke a greater and more rapid response than neutral stimuli, since this trait was essential to human evolutionary survival. People develop a higher positive association with the word "cake" than with the neutral word "window" if they press the experimental word "cake" with the joystick quicker than the neutral word "window." This is owing to the fact that a quicker reaction time indicates a higher emotional response to the experimental term, which may be linked to the word's connection with food. It may also suggest that the term "cake" is connected with more pleasure or reward than the neutral word "window."
