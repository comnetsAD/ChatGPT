When people do not provide honest or correct answers to survey questions for social or fear-related reasons, this is called response bias. Errors in measurement arise when the questions or scale used to assess viewpoints are not well-designed or verified, resulting to erroneous findings. Self-report bias arises when the individual supplying the attitude data is not the same person whose attitudes are being assessed.
