The term "response bias" describes the phenomenon that arises when people provide answers to attitude measuring questions that they think would get them positive social approval rather than giving their true opinions. This may cause a bias in the findings and therefore, incorrect inferences about the respondents' opinions. The language of a question has a significant impact on the reaction it elicits. Poorly formulated questions might elicit unreliable or inconsistent replies. Furthermore, data might be skewed if researchers use leading questions that imply a certain answer. When a person's stated opinion differs from their actual one, this is an example of measurement error. This may occur if the questions asked are vague or if the measuring tool has issues with reliability or validity. The general trustworthiness and validity of the research are compromised if erroneous inferences regarding attitudes are drawn.
