Response bias: People provide socially desired answers to attitude measuring questions instead of honest ones. This may bias findings and misinterpret sentiments. Question phrasing: Question wording affects response. Unclear questions might lead to inaccurate answers. Leading questions might potentially skew outcomes. Measurement error: An individual's genuine attitude and reaction differ. Poor question design, measuring equipment reliability, or validity might cause this. This may skew views and the study's reliability and validity.
