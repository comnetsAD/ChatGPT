Individuals may exhibit social desirability bias when they reply to questionnaires about their opinions in a manner they think would be deemed socially acceptable, rather than in a way that reflects their genuine attitudes. Because people could be ashamed to confess to particular beliefs or actions, this might lead to skewed surveys. A response bias arises when respondents to an attitude survey provide answers that aren't accurate representations of their genuine beliefs because of the questions asked, the poll's context, or the survey's administration. When people are under the impression that they are being observed or scrutinized, they may feel pressured into giving a predetermined answer on a survey. When questions in an attitude survey are ambiguous, respondents may be misled because they are unable to draw the intended conclusion. As a consequence, survey respondents may not accurately reflect actual sentiments.
