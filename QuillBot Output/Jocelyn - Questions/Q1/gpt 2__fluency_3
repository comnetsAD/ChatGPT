Social desirability bias arises when people answer to attitude surveys in ways they feel are socially acceptable, rather than in ways that truly represent their genuine opinions. Individuals may be unwilling to acknowledge to particular ideas or practices, which may lead to incorrect measuring of attitudes. Response bias arises when people react to attitude surveys in ways that are not representative of their genuine opinions owing to the phrasing of the questions, the context of the survey, or the manner in which the poll is conducted. For example, if a survey is presented in an environment where people believe they are being watched or scrutinized, they are more likely to react in the manner they believe is expected of them. Question ambiguity: This happens when the questions in an attitude survey are not clear or explicit enough, causing respondents to be confused or misinterpreted. This may lead to erroneous attitude assessment since people may not comprehend what the survey is asking.
