Social desirability bias: People answer attitude questionnaires in a manner they think is socially acceptable rather than honestly. This might cause erroneous attitude measurements since people may not want to confess their opinions or activities. Response bias: When people react to attitude surveys in a manner that doesn't represent their genuine opinions owing to question phrasing, context, or administration. If a survey is given in an environment where people feel monitored or scrutinized, they may be more likely to reply as predicted. Ambiguity: When opinion survey questions are unclear or vague, respondents may misunderstand them. Because people may not comprehend the poll, opinions may be mismeasured.
