When people reply to attitude surveys in a manner they think is socially acceptable, as opposed to honestly expressing their genuine opinions, this is known as social desirability bias. As a result, attitudes may not be accurately measured because people may be reluctant to acknowledge particular attitudes or actions. Due to the phrasing of the questions, the context of the survey, or the method of administration, people may react to attitude surveys in a manner that is not representative of their genuine opinions. For instance, people may be more likely to reply in a manner they believe is expected of them if a survey is given to them in an environment where they feel monitored or criticized. Question ambiguity: This happens when an attitude survey's questions are not explicit or clear enough, which may cause misunderstanding or incorrect interpretation among respondents. As a consequence, attitudes may not be accurately measured since respondents may not fully comprehend the survey's questions.
