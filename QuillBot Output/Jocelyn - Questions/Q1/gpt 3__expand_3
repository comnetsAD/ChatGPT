Response bias is when people reply to attitude measurement questions in a manner that they perceive is socially acceptable, rather than delivering a response that is honest, and this happens when individuals respond to attitude assessment questions. This has the potential to bias the findings and cause erroneous inferences to be drawn about people's opinions. Wording of the question: The way a question is framed may have a significant impact on the answer that is provided. Questions that are ambiguous or hard to understand might elicit replies that are inconsistent or not dependable. In addition, leading questions, or questions that indicate a certain answer to the respondent, may potentially cause bias in the findings. The term "measurement error" refers to the situation that arises when there is a disparity between the actual attitude of a person and the answer that they provide. This may occur for a variety of reasons, including a poorly conceived inquiry, unreliable or invalid measurement data, or an inadequately valid measuring tool. This may result in incorrect findings on attitudes, and it may also have an impact on the dependability and validity of the research as a whole.
