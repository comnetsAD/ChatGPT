The social desirability bias arises when people reply to attitude surveys in a manner that they feel is socially acceptable rather than truly representing their genuine opinions. This may skew the results of research. Individuals may not wish to acknowledge to particular ideas or actions, which might lead to erroneous assessment of attitudes as a result of this phenomenon. Response bias is when individuals respond to attitude surveys in a way that is not reflective of their true attitudes. This can occur as a result of the wording of the questions, the context of the survey, or the way the survey is administered. Response bias can be avoided by carefully considering the questions and the context of the survey before conducting the survey. For instance, if a survey is conducted in an environment in which respondents have the impression that they are being observed or evaluated, it is possible that they will be more inclined to react in a manner that they believe is expected of them. Ambiguity in the questions arises when the questions in an attitude survey are not clear or explicit enough, which may lead to respondents being confused or misinterpreting the questions. This might lead to an erroneous assessment of people' sentiments since respondents might not fully comprehend the nature of the questions being asked in the survey.
