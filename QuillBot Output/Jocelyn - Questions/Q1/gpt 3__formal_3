Response bias arises when people reply to attitude measuring questions in a manner they perceive to be socially acceptable, as opposed to delivering an honest response. This might lead to erroneous judgments about attitudes. The phrasing of a question may have a significant impact on the answer provided. Questions that are ambiguous or unclear may elicit replies that are inconsistent or untrustworthy. Moreover, suggestive questions that indicate a certain answer might also influence the findings. Error in measurement arises when there is a disparity between an individual's genuine attitude and their answer. This may occur as a result of ineffective question design, unreliability, or invalidity in the measuring device. This may lead to erroneous findings regarding attitudes and compromise the study's overall reliability and validity.
