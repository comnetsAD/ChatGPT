Social desirability bias arises when people reply to attitude surveys in a manner they consider to be socially acceptable, rather than in a manner that truly reflects their genuine opinions. This might result in erroneous measurements of attitudes, since people may be unwilling to acknowledge to particular beliefs or actions. Response bias arises when people react to attitude surveys in a manner that does not represent their genuine opinions owing to the phrasing of the questions, the context of the survey, or the administration of the survey. For instance, if a survey is presented in an environment where respondents believe they are being observed or evaluated, they may be more inclined to reply as they believe is expected of them. Ambiguity of questions: This arises when the questions in an attitude survey are insufficiently clear or explicit, resulting in respondents' perplexity or misunderstanding. This may lead to erroneous measurements of attitudes, since respondents may not fully comprehend the questions.
