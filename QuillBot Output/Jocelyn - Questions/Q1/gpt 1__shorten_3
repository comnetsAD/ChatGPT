Response bias: Respondents lie because of social desirability, fear of retaliation, or other factors. Measurement error: Inaccurate or unreliable findings emerge from poorly developed or verified attitude questionnaires or scales. Self-report bias: When the individual supplying attitude data is not the one being assessed, findings are incorrect or unreliable.
