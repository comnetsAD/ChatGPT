Response bias: This happens when respondents provide false or inaccurate information to avoid offending others, for social motives, or for other reasons. Measurement error: This happens when the attitudes-measuring questions or scale are not correctly developed or verified, resulting in erroneous or unreliable findings. Self-report bias is when the individual collecting the attitude data is not the person whose attitudes are being assessed, which may provide findings that are unreliable or erroneous.
