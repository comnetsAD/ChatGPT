Response bias is when respondents do not answer questions honestly or correctly owing to social desirability, fear of retaliation, or other causes. This may lead to inaccurate or misleading results. Errors in measurement arise when the questions or scale used to evaluate attitudes are not adequately created or validated, which leads to findings that are incorrect or unreliable. These errors may be caused by a number of different factors. Self-report bias is when the individual whose attitudes are being assessed is not the same person who is giving the attitude data. This may lead to findings that are erroneous or untrustworthy.
