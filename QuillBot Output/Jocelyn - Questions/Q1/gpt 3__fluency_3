Response bias arises when people reply to attitude measuring questions in ways they perceive are socially acceptable rather than delivering an honest response. This has the potential to bias the data and lead to incorrect conclusions regarding attitudes. Question wording: The way a question is phrased may have a significant impact on the answer offered. Inconsistent or unreliable replies might result from ambiguous or confusing questions. Leading questions that imply a certain answer may potentially skew the findings. Measurement error arises when there is a mismatch between an individual's genuine attitude and their answer. This might arise as a result of variables including poor question design, a lack of dependability, or a lack of validity in the measuring instrument. This may lead to incorrect conclusions regarding attitudes and undermine the study's overall reliability and validity.
