Response bias: This happens when people provide answers to attitude measuring questions that they think will be accepted by others rather than giving an honest response. As a consequence, the findings may be skewed and incorrect sentiments may be inferred. Question phrasing: A question's language has a significant impact on the answer that is provided. Vague or ambiguous questions might produce contradictory or untrustworthy answers. Leading questions that imply a certain answer may potentially skew the findings. Measurement mistake is the result of a mismatch between a person's actual attitude and the answer they provide. This may occur as a result of elements like bad question design, a measuring instrument's lack of validity, or a lack of dependability. This may result in erroneous findings regarding attitudes and compromise the study's overall validity and reliability.
