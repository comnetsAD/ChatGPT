Individuals who are frequently exposed to something tend to develop more positive attitudes toward it, regardless of their prior knowledge or experience with it. This is due to the psychological process of classical conditioning, in which an individual gradually associates a neutral stimulus with a positive feeling. That is, attitudes are created not necessarily via conscious thinking or reasoning, but sometimes through unconscious processes such as habituation and classical conditioning. This phenomenon has a significant impact on how advertising, media, and social interactions influence us.
