Mere exposure is when people like a person, thing, or concept because they've seen it often. This may happen without conscious consideration. Classical conditioning is involved. Repeated exposure to a stimuli evokes pleasant emotions. Even if they don't know why, they like the stimulation. Repeated exposure forms attitudes without conscious appraisal or knowledge. Thus, attitudes may be created subconsciously rather than consciously. In real-world scenarios like advertising or political campaigns, frequent exposure to a message or candidate may subconsciously alter perceptions.
