A phenomena known as mere exposure occurs when people choose to favor a stimulus (such as a person, thing, or concept) only because they have been exposed to it repeatedly. Without any conscious thought or knowledge of the stimuli, this may happen. There is a classical conditioning psychological process at work. When a stimulus is shown to a person repeatedly, they start to identify it with good experiences or emotions. Even if the person is unaware of their preference, this results in a favorable appraisal of the stimulus. According to mere exposure, attitudes may develop over time via repeated experience, without conscious thought or knowledge. This implies that attitudes may develop more automatically or unconsciously than via conscious or intentional deliberation. This may have consequences for how attitudes are developed in real-world circumstances, such as in political campaigns or advertisements, when frequent exposure to a specific message or candidate might affect views without the person being aware of it.
