Mere exposure refers to the phenomena in which an individual's attitudes and preferences evolve in favor of neutral or ambiguous stimuli that they have been repeatedly exposed to. This shows that individuals are more likely to establish favorable attitudes toward known stimuli than novel ones. The underlying psychological process at work is known as classical conditioning, in which repeated exposure to a neutral stimuli associates it with a positive or negative reaction. This causes familiar stimuli to become connected with positive reaction and, hence, more attractive to the person. This phenomena indicates that the development of attitudes is dependent not only on logical thought, but also on the frequency and familiarity of exposure to a certain stimuli. It also means that individuals like familiar things and may acquire favorable views toward items they are constantly exposed to, regardless of their quality.
