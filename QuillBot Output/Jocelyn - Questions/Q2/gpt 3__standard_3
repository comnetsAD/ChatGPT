A person's attitudes and preferences might shift in favor of stimuli they have been frequently exposed to, even if those stimuli are neutral or ambiguous. This phenomenon is known as mere exposure. This implies that familiar stimuli tend to elicit a more favorable emotional response in individuals than unknown ones. The underlying psychological process at play is known as classical conditioning, where a neutral stimulus is repeatedly exposed until it is linked with either a positive or negative reaction. As a result, people find familiar stimuli to be more enticing since they are linked to good reactions. This occurrence demonstrates that, in addition to logical thought, the frequency and familiarity of exposure to a specific stimuli also play a role in the development of attitudes. It also suggests that regardless of actual quality, individuals have a tendency to prefer things that are familiar to them and could form favorable opinions about them.
