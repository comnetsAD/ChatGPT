The concept of'mere exposure' refers to the phenomena in which people acquire a preference for a stimulus (such as a person, item, or idea) just because they have been exposed to it repeatedly. This may lead to the formation of strong opinions about the stimulus. This may happen even if the subject is not consciously evaluating or being aware of the input. The psychological process that is at work here is known as classical conditioning. When a person is repeatedly exposed to a stimuli, their brain eventually learns to correlate that stimulus with pleasant experiences or emotions. This results in a favorable judgment of the stimulus, even if the person is unaware of the reasons behind why they like the stimulus in question. Simply being exposed to something several times may lead to the development of an attitude, even in the absence of any conscious appraisal or knowledge. This indicates that attitudes might be created in a manner that is more automatic or unconscious, as opposed to being developed as a result of intentional thinking or careful deliberation. This may have ramifications for how attitudes are developed in real-world circumstances, such as advertising or political campaigns, when repeated exposure to a specific message or candidate can alter views without the person being aware that they are being influenced in this way.
