Mere exposure occurs when an individual's attitudes and preferences shift in favor of repeated exposure to neutral or ambiguous stimuli. This shows that humans like familiar stimuli more than novel ones. Classical conditioning links a neutral input to a positive or negative response via repeated exposure. This makes familiar stimuli more enticing by associating them with favorable responses. This shows that attitudes are formed through logical reasoning and stimulus frequency and familiarity. It also suggests that individuals appreciate familiar items and may form favorable sentiments about them regardless of their quality.
