The term "mere exposure" refers to the phenomenon in which an individual's attitudes and preferences change in favor of stimuli that they have been repeatedly exposed to, even if the stimuli are neutral or ambiguous. This can happen even if the individual is exposed to the stimuli over and over again. According to this, it seems that individuals have a tendency to form more favorable attitudes towards familiar stimuli than they do toward unknown ones. Classical conditioning is the name given to the underlying psychological mechanism that is at work here. This is the process by which a neutral stimulus gets linked with either a positive or negative reaction as a result of repeated exposure. Because of this, the person will begin to correlate previously experienced stimuli with a good reaction, making them more enticing to them. This occurrence teaches us that the development of attitudes is dependent not only on logical reasoning but also on the frequency and level of familiarity with which one is exposed to a specific stimuli. It also suggests that individuals have a natural tendency to like things that are familiar to them and that they may acquire favorable views toward things that they are regularly exposed to, regardless of the quality of the object in question.
