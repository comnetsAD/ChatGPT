The phenomena of mere exposure describes how an individual's attitudes and preferences evolve in favor of stimuli to which they have been repeatedly exposed, even if the stimulus is neutral or ambiguous. This shows that individuals have more favorable sentiments toward familiar stimuli than they do toward unknown ones. Classical conditioning is the fundamental psychological process at work, in which a neutral stimulus gets linked with a positive or negative reaction via repeated exposure. As a result, familiar stimuli get connected with positive responses, making them more enticing to the person. This phenomena demonstrates that the development of attitudes is influenced not only by logical thought but also by the frequency and familiarity with which a specific stimulus is presented. It also means that individuals like familiar things and may acquire favorable attitudes about items they are exposed to on a regular basis, regardless of their actual quality.
