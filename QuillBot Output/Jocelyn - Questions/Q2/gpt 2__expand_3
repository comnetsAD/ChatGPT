The phenomenon known as "mere exposure" describes the propensity for people to acquire more favorable views about items they are regularly exposed to, independent of whether or not they have previous knowledge or experience with the subject matter. This is due to the psychological process known as classical conditioning, in which a person gradually learns to link a neutral stimulus with a pleasant emotion over the course of some period of time. It indicates that conscious cognition and reasoning are not necessarily necessary for the formation of attitudes; rather, attitudes may sometimes be created unconsciously via processes such as habituation and classical conditioning. The way in which we are impacted by advertising, the media, and social interactions is significantly altered as a consequence of this phenomena.
