Simply said, people's preferences and opinions tend to shift in favor of stimuli that they have been frequently exposed to, even if those stimuli were initially neutral or ambiguous. This indicates that individuals are more likely to form favorable attitudes toward known stimuli than toward novel ones. Classical conditioning describes the fundamental psychological process at action here, wherein repeated exposure to a neutral stimuli causes it to be linked with a positive or negative response. This causes the brain to correlate a pleasant emotion with the recognition of a familiar stimulus. This phenomena demonstrates that repeated and familiar exposure to a stimuli is as important as logical thought when it comes to shaping one's opinions. Moreover, it suggests that individuals create favorable opinions of objects they are constantly exposed to, regardless of their real quality, since they get more comfortable with them.
