The phenomenon of mere exposure occurs when people acquire a liking for a stimulus (such as a person, item, or concept) merely because they have been exposed to it repeatedly. This may happen even if there is no cognitive review or knowledge of the input. Classical conditioning is the psychological process at work. When a stimulus is regularly shown to a person, it gets connected with favorable sensations or emotions. This results in a favorable appraisal of the stimulus, even if the person is unaware of the reason for their choice. Simply exposing people to them shows that attitudes may be developed without conscious appraisal or knowledge. This implies that attitudes might evolve more automatically or unconsciously than via careful or critical analysis. This has consequences for how attitudes are developed in real-world circumstances like advertising or political campaigns, when continuous exposure to a certain message or candidate may alter opinions without the person being aware of it.
