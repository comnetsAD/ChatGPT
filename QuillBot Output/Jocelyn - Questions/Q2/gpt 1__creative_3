People become fond of a stimulus (such as a person, an item, or a concept) merely by being exposed to it on a regular basis; this phenomena is known as "mere exposure." It is possible for this to occur without the subject evaluating or being aware of the stimuli. Classical conditioning is the underlying psychological process at work here. A person develops a favorable emotional response to a stimuli after being exposed to it many times. Thus, the stimulus is evaluated favorably, even if the subject does not understand why they like it. Repeated exposure, without assessment or awareness, is all that is needed to establish an opinion. It follows that one's opinions could be generated less by intentional thinking and more by an automatic or unconscious process. This may have ramifications for the ways in which attitudes are formed in everyday contexts, such as advertising or political campaigns, when frequent exposure to a specific message or candidate might alter views without the target audience even realizing it.
