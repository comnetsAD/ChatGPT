Individuals acquire a preference for a stimuli (such as a person, item, or concept) merely because they have been regularly exposed to it. Without conscious judgment or knowledge of the input, this may occur. The underlying psychological process is classical conditioning. When a person is frequently exposed to a stimuli, that stimulus gets connected with good emotions. This results in a favorable appraisal of the stimulus, even if the person is unaware of the reason for their preference. We may build attitudes via repeated exposure without conscious appraisal or knowledge, according to mere exposure. This implies that attitudes may be developed in a manner that is more automatic or unconscious, as opposed to intentional or critical analysis. This may have ramifications for how attitudes are formed in real-world circumstances, such as advertising or political campaigns, when continuous exposure to a certain message or candidate might subconsciously shape opinions.
