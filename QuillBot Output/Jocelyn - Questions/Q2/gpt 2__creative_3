Simply being exposed to something on a regular basis might influence one's opinion of it, regardless of one's level of expertise or familiarity with the subject. This is due to classical conditioning, a process in psychology in which a person gradually learns to identify a neutral input with a pleasant emotion. This suggests that habits and classical conditioning, for example, play a role in shaping attitudes alongside more rational processes like cognition. This phenomena has far-reaching implications for the ways in which we are affected by marketing, the media, and interpersonal relationships.
