The capacity to foresee one's emotional responses to future events or results is referred to as affective forecasting. It's the capacity to predict how we'll feel in the future. Humans are not particularly precise in affective forecasting, according to research; we tend to overestimate the strength and length of our anticipated emotional responses. For example, we may believe we will be happier or more happy with a new purchase than we are. This is due to people's propensity to concentrate on the possible good features of a future event or circumstance while ignoring the potential bad aspects. Furthermore, people prefer to concentrate on the current moment and have difficulty envisioning how their sentiments could alter in the future. When people are caught in an unfavorable scenario, their emotional forecasting might suffer. People tend to overestimate the strength and length of negative emotions while underestimating the intensity and duration of happy emotions, resulting in more negative emotional forecasting. This might result in unpleasant feelings that are more difficult to overcome, resulting in a sense of despair.
