The capacity to foresee how one will feel about upcoming circumstances is called affective forecasting. It's knowing how we're going to feel down the road and being prepared for it. Humans, according to studies, aren't great at affective forecasting; specifically, we have a tendency to exaggerate the strength and length of our anticipated emotional responses. Sometimes, we have higher expectations than reality, such as how happy or content we would be with a recent purchase. This is because humans have a bias toward seeing only the good elements of a future event or circumstance, while ignoring the bad ones. As an additional factor, people have a hard time projecting their emotions into the future and instead prefer to dwell in the here and now. A person's capacity for emotional forecasting may suffer when they are unable to escape from a stressful circumstance. Affective forecasting is more pessimistic because people tend to exaggerate the strength and length of negative emotions while underestimating the strength and duration of pleasant ones. The subsequent despair might be a consequence of bad feelings becoming entrenched and becoming more difficult to overcome.
