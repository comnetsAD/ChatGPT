The capacity to foresee how we will react emotionally in the future in reaction to a certain occurrence or circumstance is referred to as affective forecasting. It is the skill of anticipating one's emotional responses to upcoming events or results in order to prepare for them. According to the findings of research, humans are not particularly adept at making accurate forecasts. Research has demonstrated that individuals have a tendency to exaggerate the strength and length of the emotional responses they will experience in the future. People often, for instance, believe that they would be happier or more happy with a new purchase than they really are; nevertheless, this is not the case. This is due to the fact that individuals have a tendency to concentrate on the possible good features of an upcoming event or circumstance and underestimate the potential negative parts of that event or scenario. In addition, individuals have a propensity to concentrate on the here and now, and they have a difficult time seeing how the state of their emotions can develop in the future. Our capacity for affective forecasting might be badly harmed when we are unable to escape a circumstance that is not to our advantage. People have a tendency to underestimate the strength and length of happy emotions and overestimate the intensity and duration of negative emotions, which ultimately leads to more negative emotional forecasting. People have a tendency to have a more pessimistic attitude when they are in such a predicament, and this may lead to unpleasant feelings that are difficult to overcome, which in turn can lead to a sense of despair.
