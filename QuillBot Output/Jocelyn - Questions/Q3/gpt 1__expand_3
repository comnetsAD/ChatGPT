Affective forecasting is the capacity to anticipate how we will feel in the future in reaction to a certain occurrence or circumstance based on the current state of our emotions. It is the process of anticipating an individual's emotional state in the future as well as how that mood will effect the conduct of the individual. According to research, we are not very good at affective forecasting because we have a tendency to overestimate the intensity and length of our emotional reaction to upcoming events. This research implies that we are not very good at affective forecasting. We also have a propensity to grossly underestimate the speed with which we can adjust to novel circumstances and regain a more balanced emotional state. One of the reasons behind this is something that is referred to as the "impact bias," which is the propensity to overestimate the emotional influence of future occurrences. This is one of the reasons why this occurs. This is because our attention is drawn to the occurrence rather than our capacity to adjust to it and remain resilient in the face of it. Affective forecasting may lead to emotions of disappointment, anger, and even hopelessness when we are unable to escape a circumstance that is not in our best interests. Because of this, it may be difficult for us to adjust to the circumstance and find a way to manage with the bad feelings that are linked with it if the scenario is expected to last for an extended period of time.
