The capacity to foresee how we will feel in the future in reaction to a certain event or scenario is known as affective forecasting. It is the capacity to predict one's emotional responses to upcoming events or results. According to research, humans are not particularly adept at emotional forecasting. According to research, individuals tend to overestimate the strength and length of their prospective emotional responses. People often believe they will be happier or more pleased with a new purchase than they really are. This is due to the fact that individuals tend to overestimate the possible good features of a future event or circumstance while underestimating the potential negative aspects. Furthermore, individuals tend to be preoccupied with the current moment and have difficulty envisioning how their sentiments could alter in the future. When we find ourselves in an unfavorable position, our emotional forecasting might suffer. People tend to overestimate the strength and length of negative emotions while underestimating the intensity and duration of happy emotions, resulting in more negative emotional forecasting. People in such situations tend to have a more pessimistic view, which may lead to unpleasant feelings that are more difficult to overcome, leading to a sense of despair.
