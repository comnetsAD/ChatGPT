The capacity to foresee how one would feel in the future in reaction to a certain incident or circumstance is known as "affective forecasting." Emotional foresight is the practice of preparing for how one could feel in response to a situation before it happens. According to studies, humans aren't great at making emotional predictions. Emotional responses are often overestimated in terms of both their strength and their endurance, according to research. In the case of new purchases, for instance, consumers often overestimate their level of happiness or satisfaction. This is because humans have a bias toward seeing only the good elements of a future event or circumstance, while ignoring or downplaying the unfavorable ones. Furthermore, individuals have a hard time projecting their emotions into the future and like to live in the now. Affective forecasting might be badly influenced when we are caught in an unfavorable scenario. Negative emotional forecasting is more common because people tend to exaggerate the strength and duration of negative emotions while underestimating the good ones. A more pessimistic attitude in such a scenario is common, and it is often the cause of deeper feelings of despair.
