Affective forecasting predicts future emotions. Predicting future emotions is key. Humans overestimate the severity and length of their future emotions, according to research. We believe a new item will make us happier than it does. People concentrate on the positives of a future event or scenario and ignore the negatives. People concentrate on the now and have trouble envisioning how their sentiments could alter in the future. Affective forecasting might suffer under bad situations. Negative emotional forecasting occurs when people overestimate the strength and duration of negative emotions and underestimate happy feelings. This might cause more difficult negative feelings and despondency.
