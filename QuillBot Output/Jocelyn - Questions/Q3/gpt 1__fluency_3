The capacity to foresee how we will feel in the future in reaction to a certain event or scenario is referred to as affective forecasting. It is the process of forecasting one's future emotional state and how it will effect one's conduct. According to research, humans are not very effective at affective forecasting because we tend to exaggerate the strength and length of our emotional reactions to upcoming events. We frequently overestimate our ability to adjust to new events and return to a more neutral emotional state. The "impact bias," which refers to the propensity to overestimate the emotional significance of future events, is one of the causes behind this. This is because we concentrate on the incident rather than our capacity to adjust and deal with it. When we are caught in an unfavorable position, emotional forecasting may cause emotions of disappointment, irritation, and even despair. This may be especially difficult if the condition is long-term, since we may struggle to adjust and manage with the bad feelings that come with it.
