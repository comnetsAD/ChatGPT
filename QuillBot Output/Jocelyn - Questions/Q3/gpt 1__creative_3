The capacity to foretell how one's emotions will develop in reaction to a future event or circumstance is known as "affective forecasting." Foreseeing one's future emotional state and the subsequent effects on one's actions is what this term refers to. According to studies, we tend to overestimate the strength and length of our emotional reaction to upcoming events, suggesting that we are not particularly effective at affective forecasting. We also tend to underrate our ability to adjust to novel circumstances and regain emotional equilibrium. The "impact bias," the propensity to overestimate the emotional effect of future events, is a contributing factor. This occurs when our attention is fixed on the occurrence rather than our capacity for handling it. Affective forecasting may lead to negative emotions like disappointment, anger, and hopelessness when we are unable to change our current condition. If the problem persists for an extended period of time, we may have a hard time adjusting to it and overcoming the distressing feelings we associate with it.
