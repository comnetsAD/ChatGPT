The capacity to accurately anticipate one's feelings in response to impending occurrences or results is referred to as affective forecasting. It is the skill of being able to imagine how we will feel at some point in the future. According to studies, people are not particularly good at accurately predicting their future affective states. Instead, we have a tendency to overestimate the strength and length of our future emotional responses. For instance, we often have the misconception that a new acquisition would make us much happier or more happy than it really does. This is due to the fact that individuals have a tendency to concentrate on the possible good features of an upcoming event or circumstance while overlooking the potential negative parts of that event or scenario. In addition, people have a propensity to concentrate on the here and now, and they have difficulty seeing how the state of their emotions can develop in the future. A person's ability to provide an accurate emotional prediction may be significantly hampered when they are trapped in an unfavorable scenario. People have a tendency to underestimate the strength and length of good emotions, resulting to more negative emotional forecasting, while they have a tendency to overestimate the intensity and duration of negative emotions. This might result in unpleasant feelings that are more difficult to overcome, which in turn can lead to a sensation that there is no hope.
