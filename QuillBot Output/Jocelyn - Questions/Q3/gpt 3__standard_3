The capacity to anticipate one's emotional responses to impending events or results is referred to as affective forecasting. It is the capacity to foresee our feelings in the future. According to research, people tend to overestimate the strength and length of their upcoming emotional responses and are not particularly good at affective forecasting. For instance, we often misjudge our level of happiness or satisfaction after making a new purchase. This is due to the fact that individuals often ignore the potentially bad features of a situation or upcoming event in favor of focusing on its possible good qualities. Additionally, people often live in the present and struggle to imagine how their sentiments could alter in the future. Affective forecasting might be adversely affected when people are trapped in a bad environment. More negative emotional forecasting results from people's propensity to overestimate the strength and duration of negative emotions while underestimating the pleasant ones. This may result in unfavorable feelings that are more difficult to overcome and a sense of helplessness.
