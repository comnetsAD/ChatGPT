Affective forecasting is the skill of anticipating one's emotional responses to future events or results. It is the capacity to predict future emotions. Humans tend to overestimate the severity and length of their prospective emotional responses, according to scientific research. For instance, we believe a new purchase will make us happier or more fulfilled than it really does. This is due to the fact that individuals prefer to ignore the possible bad features of a future event or circumstance in favor of the potential good ones. Also, people have a tendency to concentrate on the now and have difficulty envisioning how their emotions may alter in the future. When people are trapped in an unfavorable circumstance, their predictive efficacy may suffer. People have a tendency to overestimate the strength and duration of negative emotions while underestimating the pleasant ones, resulting in more pessimistic emotional forecasting. This might result in more difficult-to-overcome unpleasant feelings and a sense of pessimism.
