The capacity to anticipate our feelings in the future in reaction to a certain event or circumstance is known as affective forecasting. It refers to the capacity to foresee one's emotional responses to upcoming occasions or results. According to research, we struggle to predict our emotions. People often overestimate the strength and length of their upcoming emotional responses, according to studies. For instance, individuals often mistakenly believe that a new purchase would make them happier or more content than they really are. This occurs because individuals often overestimate the good qualities of a situation or event and underplay their possible negative effects. People also have a propensity to just think on the here and now and find it difficult to imagine how their thoughts could alter in the future. Our ability to make affective forecasts might suffer when we are caught in an unfavorable position. More negative emotional forecasting results from people's propensity to overestimate the strength and duration of negative emotions while underestimating the pleasant ones. People tend to be more pessimistic under such circumstances, which might result in difficult-to-overcome bad feelings and a sense of despair.
