Affective forecasting predicts how we will feel in reaction to an event or scenario. It means anticipating future emotions. Affective forecasting is difficult, according to research. People overestimate their prospective emotional responses. People typically expect a new item would make them happier than it does. People concentrate on the positives of a forthcoming event or scenario and underestimate the negatives. People also concentrate on the present and struggle to imagine how their sentiments could alter in the future. Affective forecasting might suffer under unfavorable situations. Negative emotional forecasting occurs when people overestimate the strength and duration of negative emotions and underestimate happy feelings. In such a circumstance, individuals tend to have a more gloomy attitude, which may lead to unpleasant feelings that are difficult to overcome and pessimism.
