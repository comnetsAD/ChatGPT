Affective forecasting is the capacity to foresee how we will feel in reaction to a certain event or circumstance in the future. It is the capacity to predict one's emotional responses to future events or results. According to research, humans are not particularly adept at making accurate forecasts. People tend to overestimate the severity and length of their prospective emotional responses, according to studies. People often believe that a new purchase would make them happier or more content than it really does. People tend to overestimate the possible unpleasant features of a future event or circumstance and overestimate the potential favorable aspects. In addition, individuals have difficulty anticipating how their sentiments may alter in the future, since they prefer to concentrate on the current moment. When we are trapped in an unfavorable scenario, our emotional forecasting might be badly influenced. People have a tendency to overestimate the strength and duration of negative emotions while underestimating the pleasant ones, resulting in a more pessimistic emotional prediction. In such a circumstance, individuals tend to have a more pessimistic attitude, which might result in difficult-to-overcome bad feelings and a sense of despair.
