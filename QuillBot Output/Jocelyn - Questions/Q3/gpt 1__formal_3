Affective forecasting is the capacity to foresee how we will feel in reaction to a given event or circumstance in the future. It is the process of anticipating an individual's emotional state and conduct in the future. We tend to overestimate the strength and length of our emotional reaction to upcoming events, according to the findings of research. We also tend to underestimate how fast we will adjust to new surroundings and return to a level of emotional equilibrium. The propensity to overestimate the emotional significance of future events is referred to as the "impact bias." This is because we concentrate on the event itself rather than our capacity to adjust and deal with it. When we are trapped in an unfavorable scenario, emotional forecasting may lead to disappointment, irritation, and even despair. This may be especially difficult if the scenario lasts for an extended period of time, since we may find it difficult to adjust and manage the unpleasant feelings connected with it.
