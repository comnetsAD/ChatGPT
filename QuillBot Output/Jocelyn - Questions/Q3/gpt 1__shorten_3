Affective forecasting predicts how we will feel in reaction to an event or scenario. It predicts one's future emotional state and conduct. Research reveals that people overestimate the strength and length of our emotional reaction to upcoming events, making affective forecasting difficult. We also misjudge how rapidly we adjust to new surroundings and return to a neutral emotional state. The "impact bias" makes people overestimate the emotional significance of upcoming occurrences. We concentrate on the incident rather than our capacity to adjust and cope. Affective forecasting may cause disappointment, frustration, and despair in unfavorable situations. Long-term situations might make it hard to adjust and deal with bad feelings.
