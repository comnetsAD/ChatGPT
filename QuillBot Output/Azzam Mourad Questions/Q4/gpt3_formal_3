(Include full computation information.) If the system remains secure after answering question A and updating it, and a new request from process P3 comes for (0, 1, 0,0), can the request be granted immediately, and does the system remain safe? (Include full computation information.) A. Is the system safe at the moment? To establish if the system is safe, we must examine whether there is a sequence of processes that can be conducted in such a manner that all processes may complete their execution without producing a stalemate. First, we will compute the vector of accessible resources: attainable = (2, 1, 0, 0) - (0, 0, 1, 2) (0, 0, 1, 2) - (2, 0, 0, 0) (2, 0, 0, 0) - (0, 0, 3, 4) (0, 0, 3, 4) - (2, 3, 5, 4) = ( -2, -2, -9, -10) ( -2, -2, -9, -10) The system is not secure since the available resources vector contains negative values. B. If the system is still safe after answering question A and updating the system, and a fresh request for (0, 1, 0,0) occurs from process P3, can the request be granted promptly, and does the system remain safe? First, we must determine if the request may be granted promptly. The request is for resources (0, 1, 0, 0), and the existing resources available are ( -2, -2, -9, -10) The request cannot be granted immediately since the available resources vector contains negative values. Before accepting the request, we must update the system to a safe condition. If we update the system to a safe state and then verify the request, it may be granted while the system remains secure. To upgrade the system, we will go through the following steps: P1, P4, P5, P2, P3. The available resources vector would be changed to (2,1,0,0) at the conclusion of this execution, and P3 would have (0,1,0,0) accessible to it. As a result, the system is secure, and the request may be granted.
