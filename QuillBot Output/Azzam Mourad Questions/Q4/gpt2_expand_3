(Please provide all the specifics of your calculations.) Can the request from process P3 for (0, 1, 0,0) be granted instantly and does the system continue to be in a safe condition if question A is answered and the system is updated? (Include all necessary mathematic specifics.) A. Is it safe to assume that the system is in its present state? To ensure the system is in a secure condition, we must establish whether or not there exists a sequence of processes that, when run in order, allows every process to complete its lifecycle without blocking any others. To begin, we will determine the vector of accessible resources: Accessible = (2, 1, 0, 0) - (0, 0, 1, 2) (0, 0, 1, 2) - (2, 0, 0, 0) (2, 0, 0, 0) - (0, 0, 3, 4) (0, 0, 3, 4) - (2, 3, 5, 4) = ( -2, -2, -9, -10) ( -2, -2, -9, -10) Since the vector of accessible resources contains negative values, the system is not secure. If the answer to question A is yes and the system has been updated, then question B asks whether or not a new request from process P3 for (0, 1, 0,0) may be granted immediately while the system remains in a safe condition. We should first see whether this request can be fulfilled instantly. The requested resources are (0, 1, 0), and the present resources are ( -2, -2, -9, -10) For this reason, the request must be delayed since the vector of accessible resources contains negative numbers. To fulfill your request, we must first get the system up to date and secure. Requests may be allowed while the system is still in a secure condition if we first bring it up to date and then then verify it. The following procedures will be carried out in order to effect the necessary changes to the system: P1, P4, P5, P2, and P3. At the conclusion of this run, P3 would have a resource allocation of (0,1,0,0) and the available resources vector would have been updated to (2,1,0,0). As a result, the request may be fulfilled since the system is secure.
