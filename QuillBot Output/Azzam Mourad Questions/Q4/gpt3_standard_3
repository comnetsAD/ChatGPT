(Explain every aspect of the computation.) After answering question A and updating the system, if the system is still secure, can a fresh request from process P3 for (0, 1, 0, 0) be granted right away and does the system remain safe? (Explain every aspect of the computation.) A. Is the system at this time secure? Checking for a sequence of processes that may be performed in a fashion that allows all processes to complete their execution without producing a stalemate is necessary to ascertain if the system is in a safe state. We shall first determine the vector of resources that are available: Accessible = (2, 1, 0, 0) - (0, 0, 1, 2) (0, 0, 1, 2) - (2, 0, 0, 0) (2, 0, 0, 0) - (0, 0, 3, 4) (0, 0, 3, 4) - (2, 3, 5, 4) = ( -2, -2, -9, -10) ( -2, -2, -9, -10) The system is not in a safe condition since the vector representing the available resources contains negative values. B. If the system is still safe after answering question A and being updated, may a fresh request for (0, 1, 0, 0) from process P3 be immediately granted, and does the system remain secure as a result? First, we must determine if the request can be fulfilled right now. The requested resources are (0, 1, 0, 0) and the ones that are currently accessible are ( -2, -2, -9, -10) The request cannot be fulfilled right away since the vector of resources available contains negative values. Before approving the request, we must upgrade the system to a secure condition. The request may be granted and the system will remain in a safe condition if we update it to a state where it is secure and then verify it. We will carry out the procedures in the following sequence to upgrade the system: P1, P4, P5, P2, P3. The accessible resources vector would be changed to (2,1,0,0) at the conclusion of this execution, and P3 would have access to (0,1,0,0). As a result, the request may be granted since the system is in a secure condition.
