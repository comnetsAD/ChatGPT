Because of social dynamics, the link between quality and status may shift over time, becoming disconnected. Thorsten Hens' "The Decoupling of Quality and Status: An Analysis of the Market for Luxury Goods" and Michael T. Hannan and Barbara Schneider's "The Decoupling of Status and Quality in the Market for Higher Education" are two publications that illustrate this trend. Hens analyzes the luxury goods industry in "The Decoupling of Quality and Status: An Examination of the Market for Luxury Goods," and he concludes that the correlation between price and prestige has weakened. While Hens agrees that luxury items have traditionally been associated with superior quality, he contends that this association has shifted in recent years to focus more on status than on actual product value. Social dynamics, including the democratization of luxury products, their commercialization, and greater competitiveness in the luxury goods market, are to blame, he contends, for the uncoupling of quality and prestige. Hannan and Schneider conclude that the link between prestige and educational quality has shifted through time in their article "The Decoupling of Status and Quality in the Market for Higher Education." Historically, elite schools were thought to provide the best education possible. However, Hannan and Schneider contend that this perception has shifted in recent years, with elite schools now being seen more for their prestige than for the quality of their programs. They contend that societal dynamics, such as the proliferation of universities, the dissemination of information about institutions, and the intensification of rivalry in the higher education market, are to blame for this disentanglement of prestige and quality. Both pieces of research show that the link between quality and status may shift over time due to social dynamics including democratization, commodification, and greater competition.
