Social factors may separate quality and prestige over time. "The Decoupling of Quality and Status: An Analysis of the Market for Luxury Goods" by Thorsten Hens and "The Decoupling of Status and Quality in the Market for Higher Education" by Michael T. Hannan and Barbara Schneider show this. In "The Decoupling of Quality and Status: An Analysis of the Market for Luxury Goods," Hens finds that quality and status have altered throughout time. In recent years, luxury products have been more connected with status than quality, according to Hens. The democratization, commercialization, and greater competitiveness in the luxury goods industry have caused this dissociation of quality and prestige, he claims. Hannan and Schneider discover in "The Decoupling of Status and Quality in the Market for Higher Education" that status and quality have altered through time. Hannan and Schneider claim that elite institutions are now more linked with prestige than excellence. The expanding number of institutions, availability of information about universities, and competitiveness in the higher education market have led to this decoupling of prestige and quality, they claim. Both publications show how social dynamics like democratization, commercialization, and greater competition may decouple quality and status over time.
