Several social mechanisms may decouple quality and status. Two papers show this: The Market for Lemons by George Akerlof. Akerlof claims in this study that asymmetric market knowledge may decouple quality and price. He offers the example of the used automobile market, where consumers cannot clearly discriminate between excellent and poor cars, resulting in a general deterioration in car quality and a fall in good car pricing. "Signaling Social Status with Luxury Goods: Brand Prominence" by Kees van den Bulte and Eric Bradlow. This article explores how luxury items indicate social standing and how brand dominance affects this signal. As luxury products become more available, their capacity to indicate status decreases, decoupling quality and status, according to the report. The article shows that luxury items' status signals depend on brand prominence. Even if they are equal in quality, more recognized brands convey better prestige. Both articles show how market dynamics and brand dominance decouple quality and status. The first article decouples because it's hard to tell excellent items from mediocre ones, and the second paper decouples because luxury goods are becoming less exclusive and brand prominence is a status symbol.
