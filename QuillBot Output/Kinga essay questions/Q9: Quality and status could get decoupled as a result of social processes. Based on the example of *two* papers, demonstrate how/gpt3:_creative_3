Decoupling of quality and status may occur as a result of numerous social dynamics. As evidence, consider the following two papers: George Akerlof's "The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism" explores this topic. Akerlof contends in this work that quality and price might become uncoupled due to asymmetry in information in the market. He cites the example of the used car market, where consumers' inability to tell excellent vehicles from from low-end ones causes a general deterioration in the quality of vehicles on the market and causes good vehicles' values to fall. Kees van den Bulte and Eric Bradlow wrote a paper titled "Signaling Social Status with Luxury Goods: The Role of Brand Prominence." In this research, we analyze how the visibility of a brand's name affects the efficiency of a status signal sent by flaunting high-end items. The report contends that the decoupling of quality and status is occurring because luxury items are becoming more accessible and inexpensive, reducing their potential to communicate status. This article shows that the prestige of a brand, or how well-known it is, is very important when sending social signals via high-end consumer products. Even if two brands are equally good, the more well-known one will carry a more prestigious status signal. Both articles show how societal forces at work in the market, such as the power of brands, may separate prestige and quality. The inability to tell a high-quality product from a low-quality one is to blame for the decoupling in the first study, while the lessening of the luxury market's exclusivity and the growing importance of well-known brands in signaling social status are to blame for the second.
