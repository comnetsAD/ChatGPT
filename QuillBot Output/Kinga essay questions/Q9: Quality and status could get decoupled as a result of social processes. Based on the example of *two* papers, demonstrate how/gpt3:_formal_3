Several social dynamics may result in the separation of quality and status. Two publications that illustrate this point are: George Akerlof authored "The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism." In this work, Akerlof contends that asymmetric knowledge on the market might lead to the decoupling of price and quality. He offers the example of the used vehicle market, where consumers cannot readily differentiate between good and terrible automobiles, resulting in a general deterioration in the quality of cars available for sale and a fall in the value of the excellent cars owing to the difficulty in identifying them from the bad ones. Authors Kees van den Bulte and Eric Bradlow authored "Signaling Social Status with Luxury Goods: The Role of Brand Prominence." This research investigates how the presentation of luxury products may indicate social standing and how the prominence of the brand might influence the efficacy of this signal. The research claims that when luxury items become more accessible and inexpensive, their capacity to indicate status diminishes, resulting in a disconnection between quality and status. The article reveals that brand prominence, or the degree to which a brand is well-known and recognizable, plays a vital role in status signaling through luxury items. Even if they are of same quality, more prominent brands communicate a greater status than less famous ones. Both works illustrate how social mechanisms, such as market dynamics and brand prominence, may decouple quality and prestige. In the first paper, decoupling occurs as a result of the difficulty in distinguishing good quality products from poor quality products, whereas in the second paper, decoupling occurs as a result of the decline in the exclusivity of luxury goods and the importance of brand prominence in signaling status.
