There are several different social processes that might lead to the quality and prestige becoming uncoupled from one another. The following are a few of publications that are good examples of this: The author George Akerlof titled his book "The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism." Akerlof contends in this article that the presence of asymmetric information in the market might result in the uncoupling of quality and price. He cites the example of the market for used automobiles, in which consumers have a difficult time differentiating between good and bad automobiles. This has resulted in a general decline in the quality of automobiles that are available for purchase, as well as a decline in the prices of good automobiles, due to the difficulty of distinguishing them from bad automobiles. Authors Kees van den Bulte and Eric Bradlow wrote an article titled "Signaling Social Status with Luxury Goods: The Role of Brand Prominence." In this study, we investigate the ways in which the display of luxury items might communicate social status as well as the ways in which the prominence of the brand can alter the efficacy of this signal. The thesis of this research is that as a result of quality and status being uncoupled, luxury items are losing their power to convey social status since they are becoming more easily attainable and less expensive. The study indicates that one of the most important factors in determining status via the consumption of luxury products is the prominence of the brand, which refers to the degree to which the brand is known and recognized. Even if they are of the same quality, brands that are more visible in the marketplace convey a better status than brands that are less prominent. Both of these works illustrate how social factors such as the dynamics of the market and the prominence of brands may result in a disconnection between quality and prestige. In the first paper, the decoupling occurs because it is difficult to distinguish between products of good quality and products of poor quality. In the second paper, the decoupling occurs because of a decrease in the exclusivity of luxury goods, as well as the role of brand prominence in signaling status.
