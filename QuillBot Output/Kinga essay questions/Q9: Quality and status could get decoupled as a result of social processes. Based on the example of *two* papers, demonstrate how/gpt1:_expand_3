It is possible for quality and status to become uncoupled as a consequence of social processes; this means that the connection between these two notions may shift throughout the course of time. The articles "The Decoupling of Quality and Status: An Analysis of the Market for Luxury Goods" by Thorsten Hens and "The Decoupling of Status and Quality in the Market for Higher Education" by Michael T. Hannan and Barbara Schneider are two papers that provide evidence of this phenomenon. Both articles are available online. Hens investigates the market for luxury goods in his article titled "The Decoupling of Quality and Status: An Analysis of the Market for Luxury Goods," and he comes to the conclusion that the link between quality and status has shifted over the course of time. Hens contends that in recent years, luxury items have become more linked with status and less connected with quality. Luxury products were historically associated with high levels of quality; but, in recent years, this association has shifted. He contends that societal factors such as the democratization of luxury products, the commercialization of luxury goods, and the increasing rivalry in the market for luxury goods are to blame for the uncoupling of quality and social position. Hannan and Schneider investigate the market for higher education in their article titled "The Decoupling of Status and Quality in the Market for Higher Education," where they come to the conclusion that the link between status and quality has also shifted throughout the course of time. Hannan and Schneider argue that in recent years, prestigious universities have become more associated with status and less associated with quality of education. Historically, prestigious universities were associated with high-quality education; however, in recent years, prestigious universities have become more associated with status. They contend that social dynamics such as the expanding number of institutions, the expanding availability of information about universities, and the expanding competitiveness in the market for higher education are the causes of this uncoupling of prestige and quality. The authors of both studies show how social processes like democratization, commodification, and increasing competition may lead to the decoupling of quality and status. This is a situation in which the connection between these two ideas changes over the course of time.
