Social dynamics may lead to the decoupling of quality and status, which means that the two notions' connection might alter through time. The Decoupling of Quality and Status: An Analysis of the Market for Luxury Goods by Thorsten Hens and The Decoupling of Status and Quality in the Market for Higher Education by Michael T. Hannan and Barbara Schneider are two studies that illustrate this phenomena. Hens studies the market for luxury goods in "The Decoupling of Quality and Status: An Analysis of the Market for Luxury Goods" and finds that the connection between quality and status has shifted through time. Hens contends that although historically luxury items have been linked to high quality, this association has shifted in recent years to one of prestige rather than high quality. He contends that societal factors including the democratization of luxury products, their commercialization, and the heightened competitiveness in the market for luxury goods are to blame for the decoupling of quality and prestige. Hannan and Schneider look at the market for higher education in "The Decoupling of Status and Quality in the Market for Higher Education" and discover that the connection between status and quality has also shifted through time. In the past, elite colleges were linked to high-quality education, but Hannan and Schneider contend that in more recent times, elite institutions have grown to be linked more to status and less to education. They contend that societal dynamics including the expansion of universities, the expansion of knowledge about universities, and the expansion of competition in the higher education market are to blame for the decoupling of prestige and quality. The authors of both studies show how social processes like democratization, commodification, and increasing competition may result in the decoupling of status and quality, where the connection between these two ideas shifts over time.
