As a consequence of social dynamics, quality and status may become divorced, implying that the connection between these two ideas might shift through time. Thorsten Hens' article "The Decoupling of Quality and Status: An Analysis of the Market for Luxury Goods" and Michael T. Hannan and Barbara Schneider's paper "The Decoupling of Status and Quality in the Market for Higher Education" both highlight this issue. Hens studies the market for luxury goods in "The Decoupling of Quality and Status: An Analysis of the Market for Luxury Goods" and finds that the link between quality and status has altered through time. Historically, luxury products were linked with high quality, but Hens contends that in recent years, they have become more connected with status and less with quality. He contends that the decoupling of quality and prestige is the outcome of societal processes such as democratization of luxury products, commodification of luxury goods, and increasing competitiveness in the luxury goods market. Hannan and Schneider study the market for higher education in "The Decoupling of Status and Quality in the Market for Higher Education," and discover that the link between status and quality has also shifted through time. Historically, prominent colleges were linked with high-quality education; however, Hannan and Schneider contend that in recent years, prestigious institutions have become more connected with status and less with quality. They contend that the decoupling of prestige and quality is the outcome of societal factors such as the growing number of institutions, the increased availability of information about colleges, and the increased rivalry in the higher education market. Both publications show how social processes like democratization, commercialization, and increasing competition may lead to the decoupling of quality and status, where the connection between these two ideas shifts over time.
