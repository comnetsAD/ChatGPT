There are several different social processes that might lead to the quality and prestige becoming uncoupled from one another. The following two papers serve as illustrations of how this kind of thing might take place: Robert Merton's article "The Matthew Effect in Science" explains: Merton contends in this article that the so-called "Matthew Effect" might result in the quality and prestige of scientific research being uncoupled from one another. It is called the Matthew Effect, and it describes the phenomenon in which scientists who have a high level of initial prestige and visibility tend to receive more credit and recognition for their work, even if their work is of lower quality than the work of other scientists who are not as well known. According to Merton, this might result in a decoupling of quality and prestige, which can lead to a scenario in which the most highly visible and prominent scientists are not always the ones producing the greatest work. The paradox of meritocracy in organizations is explored in Lauren Rivera's article as follows: Rivera explores the recruiting procedures of prestigious professional service businesses in this article, and he makes the argument that meritocracy may result in the uncoupling of quality and prestige in the workplace. Rivera discovered that these businesses often utilize "culture fit" as a primary factor for selecting applicants. This might lead to a bias towards candidates who are similar to current workers rather than those who are the most competent. This may result in a decoupling of quality and prestige, leading to a scenario in which the applicants with the highest level of qualifications are not always the ones that are recruited. Both of these papers illustrate how social processes can lead to the decoupling of quality and status by demonstrating how factors such as prestige, visibility, and cultural fit can be used to evaluate performance and assign credit or recognition rather than focusing solely on the quality of the work or merit. In other words, these papers show how prestige, visibility, and cultural fit can be used to evaluate performance and assign credit or recognition.
