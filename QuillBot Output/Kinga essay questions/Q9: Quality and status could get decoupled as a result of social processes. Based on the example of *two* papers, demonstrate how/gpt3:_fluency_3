Several social factors might result in the decoupling of quality and status. Here are two publications that illustrate this: George Akerlof's "The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism". Akerlof argues in this study that the presence of asymmetric information in the market might lead to the decoupling of quality and price. He takes the used vehicle market as an example, where consumers cannot readily discern between excellent and poor automobiles, resulting in a general deterioration in the quality of cars for sale and a fall in the pricing of the good cars owing to the difficulty in differentiating them from the bad ones. "Signaling Social Status Through Luxury Goods: The Role of Brand Prominence," by Kees van den Bulte and Eric Bradlow. This research investigates how the display of luxury items may convey social status and how the brand's prominence affects the efficacy of this signal. According to the report, when luxury items become more accessible and inexpensive, their capacity to indicate status deteriorates, resulting in a decoupling of quality and status. The article shows that brand prominence, or the degree to which a brand is known and recognized, is important in conveying status via luxury items. Even if they are of same quality, more prominent brands convey greater status than less famous ones. Both articles show how social forces like market dynamics and brand prominence may cause the decoupling of quality and status. The decoupling occurs in the first study because to the difficulty of identifying excellent quality items from low quality products, and it occurs in the second paper due to the decline in the exclusivity of luxury goods and the function of brand prominence in signaling status.
