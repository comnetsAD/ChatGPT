Due to social dynamics, quality and status may become dissociated, meaning that the connection between these two ideas might vary through time. Thorsten Hens's "The Decoupling of Quality and Status: An Analysis of the Market for Luxury Goods" and Michael T. Hannan and Barbara Schneider's "The Decoupling of Status and Quality in the Market for Higher Education" are examples of this phenomena. In "The Decoupling of Quality and Status: An Analysis of the Industry for Luxury Goods," Hens analyzes the luxury goods market and concludes that the link between quality and status has evolved through time. Hens thinks that, in recent years, luxury products have grown more linked with status and less with quality. This decoupling of quality and prestige, according to him, is the outcome of societal processes such as the democratization of luxury products, the commercialization of luxury goods, and the increasing competitiveness in the luxury goods market. In "The Decoupling of Status and Quality in the Market for Higher Education," Hannan and Schneider analyze the market for higher education and conclude that the link between status and quality has evolved through time. Historically, prominent colleges were linked with high-quality education, but Hannan and Schneider suggest that, in recent years, they have become more associated with status and less with quality. They claim that this decoupling of prestige and quality is the outcome of societal dynamics such as the growing number of institutions, the growing availability of information about colleges, and the growing rivalry in the higher education market. In both studies, the authors explain how social processes such as democratization, commodification, and increasing competition may result in the decoupling of quality and status, whereby the connection between these two ideas shifts through time.
