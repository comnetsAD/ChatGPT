The decoupling of status and quality may result from a number of social factors. Here are two publications that illustrate how this might happen. Robert Merton's "The Matthew Effect in Science": In this essay, Merton makes the case that the "Matthew Effect" may cause the quality and stature of scientific research to become uncoupled. The Matthew Effect is a term used to describe the tendency for scientists with a high degree of early prestige and exposure to obtain greater credit and acknowledgment for their work, even if it is of poorer quality than that of less well-known scientists. Merton contends that this may result in a scenario where the finest research is not always being done by the most renowned and highly visible scientists, leading to a decoupling of quality and status. According to Lauren Rivera's "The Paradox of Meritocracy in Organizations," In this essay, Rivera investigates the recruiting procedures of prestigious professional service organizations and makes the case that meritocracy might result in the separation of status and quality. According to Rivera, these companies often base recruiting decisions on "culture fit," which may lead to a bias in favor of applicants who are similar to current workers rather than the most qualified. This may result in a scenario where the most competent applicants are not always hired, which would decouple quality from status. Both of these papers provide examples of how social processes can result in the decoupling of quality and status by demonstrating how evaluation of performance and attribution of credit or recognition can be based on factors other than just the caliber or merit of the work, such as prestige, visibility, and cultural fit.
