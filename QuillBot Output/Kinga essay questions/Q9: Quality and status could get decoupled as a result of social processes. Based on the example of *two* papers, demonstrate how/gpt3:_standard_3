The decoupling of status and quality may result from a number of social factors. Here are two studies that illustrate this: George Akerlof wrote "The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism." In this essay, Akerlof makes the case that asymmetric knowledge in the market might cause the decoupling of price and quality. He uses the used car market as an example, where it is difficult for buyers to distinguish between good and bad vehicles, which results in a general decline in the quality of vehicles available for sale and a decrease in the prices of the good vehicles because it is so difficult to tell them apart from the bad ones. By Kees van den Bulte and Eric Bradlow, "Signaling Social Status with Luxury Goods: The Role of Brand Prominence." This essay explores how displaying expensive products might convey social status and how brand recognition can influence how successful this signal is. The study makes the case that the capacity of luxury items to indicate status is weakened as they become more widely available and reasonably priced, leading to a decoupling of quality and status. The study shows that brand prominence, or how well-known and recognizable a brand is, is an important factor in indicating status via luxury items. Even if two brands are of the same quality, those that are more prominent convey a better prestige than those that are less prominent. The decoupling of quality and status may be caused by social factors including market dynamics and brand prominence, as shown in both publications. The decoupling occurs in the first study because to the difficulty in differentiating between high-quality items and low-quality products, while it occurs in the second paper due to the decline in the exclusivity of luxury goods and the significance of brand prominence in indicating status.
