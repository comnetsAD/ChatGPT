Several social mechanisms may decouple quality and status. Two papers show this: Robert Merton's "Matthew Effect in Science": Merton claims in this study that the "Matthew Effect" may decouple scientific research quality and prestige. The Matthew Effect occurs when scientists with high starting reputation and exposure obtain greater credit and acknowledgment for their work, even if it is poorer quality. This may decouple quality and prestige, Merton claims, since the most prominent and renowned scientists may not be the greatest. Lauren Rivera: "The Paradox of Meritocracy in Organizations" Rivera explores the recruiting procedures of top professional service businesses and argues that meritocracy may decouple quality and status in this research. Rivera discovered that these organizations typically hire based on "cultural fit," which might favor applicants who are like current workers over the most qualified. This may decouple quality and prestige by hiring less-qualified personnel. These studies explain how prestige, visibility, and cultural fit may be utilized to assess performance and provide credit or acknowledgment, decoupling quality and status.
