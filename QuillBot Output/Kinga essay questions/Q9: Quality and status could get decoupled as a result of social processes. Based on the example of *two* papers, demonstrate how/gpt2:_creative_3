Several social dynamics may result in the separation of quality and status. Here are two examples of articles that illustrate this phenomenon: Robert Merton's "The Matthew Effect in Science" entails: In this article, Merton contends that the "Matthew Effect" might lead to the decoupling of research quality and prestige. The Matthew Effect refers to the phenomena in which scientists with a high degree of early prestige and exposure tend to gain more credit and acknowledgment for their work, despite the fact that their work is of poorer quality than that of less-famous scientists. This, according to Merton, might lead to a system in which the most prominent and renowned scientists are not always the greatest workers, resulting in a decoupling of quality and prestige. Lauren Rivera, "The Paradox of Meritocracy in Organizations" In this work, Rivera studies the recruiting procedures of top professional service organizations and argues that meritocracy may decouple quality and prestige. Rivera discovered that these companies often utilize "cultural fit" as a primary recruiting factor, which might result in a bias toward applicants who are similar to current workers rather than the most competent. This might result in a scenario in which the most qualified people are not necessarily recruited, resulting in a separation of quality and status. These two publications highlight how social processes may lead to the decoupling of quality and status by demonstrating how prestige, visibility, and cultural compatibility can be utilized to judge performance and allocate credit or acknowledgment, as opposed to relying exclusively on the quality of work or merit.
