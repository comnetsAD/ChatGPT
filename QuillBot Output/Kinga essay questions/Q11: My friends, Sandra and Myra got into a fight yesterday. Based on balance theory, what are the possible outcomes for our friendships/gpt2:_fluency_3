According to balance theory, the result of a quarrel between two friends, such as Sandra and Myra, may be influenced by the character of their other friendships as well as the balance of positive and negative ties in their social network. One probable conclusion of the disagreement is that Sandra and Myra's friendship will dissolve and they will no longer socialize with one other. This might occur if the conflict's bad sensations exceed the pleasant ones existing in the friendship. Another possibility is that Sandra and Myra's friendship will continue, but in a weaker form, with less communication, trust, and closeness. This is possible if the disagreement is not addressed and the bad sentiments it generates persist. A third potential consequence is that the disagreement will enhance Sandra and Myra's relationship as they work through their differences and get a better understanding of one other. This might happen if the disagreement is resolved and the good sentiments from the friendship exceed the bad ones caused by the conflict. A fourth potential conclusion is that Sandra and Myra's friendship will remain mostly unchanged, with no significant changes in the degree of closeness, trust, or communication. This is possible if the dispute is not serious or if the friends can reconcile it quickly. It's vital to note that the result of the dispute may also be determined by the character of other connections within the social network, as well as whether or not the balance of good and negative relationships is maintained. If Sandra and Myra have other close friends who support them, the bad impacts of the disagreement may be reduced, and the relationship may continue or even strengthen.
