A social psychology theory called "balance theory" discusses how individuals try to keep things balanced in their social interactions. The balance theory states that relationships are balanced when one person's attitudes, beliefs, and actions are congruent with another person's. This equilibrium is upset and a relationship is said to be unbalanced when there is a dispute or conflict between two persons. There are numerous consequences for the friendship between Sandra, Myra, and you after their argument, according to balancing theory: Balance restoration: By working through their differences and regaining a condition of consistency in their attitudes, beliefs, and actions, Sandra and Myra may be able to mend their differences and bring balance back into their partnership. Segregation could arise if Sandra and Myra decide to sever their relationship and stop interacting with one another. When a relationship is seen to be too unbalanced and it is deemed not to be worth the effort to restore equilibrium, this might occur. Triangulation: In order to balance out their connection, Sandra and Myra could turn to third parties like you or other friends for assistance. Triangulation is a strategy that may be used to ease tension and bring harmony back into a relationship. The imbalance between Sandra and Myra may continue to exist if they decide to be at odds with one another. When the connection is deemed valuable enough to continue despite the imbalance, this might occur. It's important to remember that the balance theory is not the sole explanation for social interactions. A variety of variables, such as personalities, setting, and other social dynamics, may influence how a dispute or disagreement plays out.
