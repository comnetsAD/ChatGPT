Balance theory states that the result of a quarrel between two friends, such as Sandra and Myra, might rely on the nature of their other friendships and the balance of positive and negative ties within their social network. Sandra and Myra's relationship may come to an end as a result of the argument, and they will no longer socialize with one another. This might occur if the bad emotions caused by the argument exceed the good emotions existing in the friendship. It is also feasible that Sandra and Myra's friendship may continue, but in a weaker condition, with less communication, less trust, and less closeness. This may occur if the disagreement is not addressed and the unpleasant emotions it generates persist. The third potential result is that Sandra and Myra's relationship will be enhanced as they work through their disagreements and get a better understanding of one another. This may occur if the disagreement is resolved and the good sentiments in the friendship exceed the bad ones caused by the conflict. The fourth probable conclusion is that Sandra and Myra's friendship will remain mostly unchanged; that is, the degree of closeness, trust, and communication will not alter much. This might occur if the issue is minor or if the friends are able to swiftly reconcile it. It is crucial to highlight that the result of the dispute might also rely on the character of other connections within the social network, as well as on whether the balance between good and negative relationships is preserved or disturbed. If Sandra and Myra have other close friends who support them, for instance, the bad impacts of the disagreement may be reduced and the relationship may continue or even strengthen.
