The Balance Theory is a Social Psychological Theory That Suggests People Strive to Maintain Balance in Their Relationships By Aligning Their Attitudes And Behaviors With Those Of Their Friends The Balance Theory is a social psychological theory that proposes people strive to maintain balance in their relationships by align After an argument or disagreement, there are three distinct directions that a relationship might go in, according to the balance theory: back to equilibrium, out of whack, or completely off the rails. The equilibrium in Sandra and Myra's relationship will be restored to its former state if they are successful in resolving the disagreement that arose between them and in keeping a good attitude toward one another. This indicates that their perspectives and ways of behaving will be congruent with one another, and that their friendship will continue in the same manner as before. Instability If Sandra and Myra are unable to settle their disagreement but are still able to retain their relationship, there is a possibility that an imbalance may develop. In this scenario, one or both of the participants may adjust their perspectives or actions in order to preserve the connection; but, the friendship will be defined by tension or discomfort. The relationship will come to an end if Sandra and Myra are unable to come to an agreement on how to handle their disagreement and decide to sever their friendship. This indicates that their mindsets and actions will not be congruent with one another, which will ultimately result in the dissolution of their connection. It is important to note that balance theory is not the only explanation for the dynamics of relationships. Many other factors, such as the nature of the conflict, the communication skills of the individuals, the type of relationship, and the context in which the conflict takes place, will also play a role in determining the outcome of the friendship. The context in which the conflict takes place is also an important factor. After an argument or disagreement, there are three potential outcomes for a friendship: equilibrium (balance), imbalance (imbalance), and dissolution (dissolution). The Balance hypothesis posits that individuals attempt to preserve balance in their relationships. If things are in equilibrium, the relationship will go on as usual. If things are out of equilibrium, the friendship will be fraught with stress or discomfort. Dissolution indicates that the friendship will come to an end.
