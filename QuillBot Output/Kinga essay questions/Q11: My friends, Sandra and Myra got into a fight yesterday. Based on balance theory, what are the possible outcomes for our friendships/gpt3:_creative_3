According to the social psychology idea of "balancing," individuals try to strike a good chord with their social circle by conforming to their peers' norms of thought and action. After a disagreement or conflict, relationships might return to equilibrium, become imbalanced, or completely break down, as described by the balance theory. Restoring harmony in their relationship, if Sandra and Myra can work out their differences and have a good attitude toward each other. This ensures that they will maintain a harmonious connection and share similar perspectives and habits. An imbalance may develop if Sandra and Myra are unable to overcome their disagreement and still continue to be friends. It's possible that one or both people involved might make adjustments to their conduct or outlook in order to keep the friendship going, but it would still be fraught with awkwardness and tension. This friendship will end if Sandra and Myra are unable to work out their differences and decide to cut ties. As a result, they will no longer be able to maintain a harmonious relationship because of their divergent perspectives and actions. It's crucial to remember that balance theory is just one explanation of relationship dynamics; other elements, like as the kind of connection, the people involved, the nature of the dispute, and the setting in which it occurs, will all play a part in deciding the fate of the friendship. In essence, according to the Balance theory's proposal that individuals try to strike a healthy balance in their relationships, there are three potential outcomes for a friendship after a disagreement or conflict: balance, imbalance, and disintegration. If the friendship is in a state of equilibrium, it will carry on as usual; if it is out of equilibrium, it will be characterized by tension or discomfort; and if it is dissolved, it will terminate.
