Balance theory suggests that Sandra and Myra's disagreement may rely on their other connections and the social network's balance of positive and negative interactions. The dispute may cause Sandra and Myra to break up. If conflict sentiments overwhelm friendship feelings, this might happen. Sandra and Myra may continue their connection, but with less communication, trust, and closeness. If the disagreement is not resolved and unpleasant sentiments persist, this may happen. The disagreement may deepen Sandra and Myra's relationship as they resolve their differences and learn more about each other. If the disagreement is resolved and the good sensations from the friendship exceed the bad ones, this might happen. A fourth possibility is that Sandra and Myra's friendship will remain unchanged in closeness, trust, and communication. If the disagreement is minor or the friends overcome it quickly, this may happen. The conflict's conclusion might also rely on the social network's other connections and whether the balance of good and negative ties is preserved or upset. For instance, if Sandra and Myra have other close friends who support them, the tension may lessen and the relationship may even deepen.
