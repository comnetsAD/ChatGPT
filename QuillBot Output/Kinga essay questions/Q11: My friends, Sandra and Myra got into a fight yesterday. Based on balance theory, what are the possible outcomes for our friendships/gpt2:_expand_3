The resolution of a dispute between two friends, such as Sandra and Myra, might be contingent on the nature of their other friendships and the equilibrium of positive and negative interactions within the social network, according to the balance theory. In this example, Sandra and Myra are friends. As a result of the disagreement, one of the potential outcomes is that Sandra and Myra will no longer be friends with each other and will no longer socialize with each other. This may occur if the bad sentiments brought on by the argument are more significant than the pleasant ones that were present in the friendship before to the disagreement. There is also the possibility that Sandra and Myra's relationship may continue, but in a diminished condition, characterized by a reduction in the amount of communication, trust, and closeness that exists between the two of them. This is something that might occur if the disagreement is not addressed and the bad sentiments that it caused continue to be present in the relationship. As Sandra and Myra work through their disagreements and get a better understanding of one another, a third potential outcome is that their relationship will be enhanced as a result of the struggle. This could occur if the disagreement is settled and the good sentiments that have always been a part of the friendship prove to be stronger than the bad feelings that were caused by the disagreement. The fourth potential consequence is that Sandra and Myra's relationship would not alter all that much. This would mean that their friendship would continue as it had previously, with no significant shifts in the degree of closeness, trust, or communication between the two of them. This could occur if the argument between the friends is not too serious or if they are able to settle it in a short amount of time. It is essential to keep in mind that the resolution of the dispute may also be determined by the dynamics of the other friendships that exist within the social network, as well as by whether or not the equilibrium between positive and negative connections is preserved or thrown off. For instance, if Sandra and Myra have other close friends who are on their side throughout the disagreement, it is possible that the bad consequences of the fight may be lessened, and it is also possible that their relationship will continue or even become stronger.
