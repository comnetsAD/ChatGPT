Balance theory is a social psychology theory that claims that individuals try to keep their relationships balanced by matching their views and actions with those of their friends. Following a battle or disagreement, there are three potential outcomes for relationships, according to balance theory: equilibrium, imbalance, and disintegration. Balance will be restored in Sandra and Myra's friendship if they can overcome their argument and keep pleasant attitudes toward one other. This suggests that their attitudes and actions will match, and their relationship will continue as usual. Imbalance: If Sandra and Myra are unable to overcome their disagreement yet continue to be friends, an imbalance may arise. In this instance, one or both people may adjust their views or actions in order to keep the connection going, but the friendship will be tense or uncomfortable. If Sandra and Myra are unable to overcome their disagreement and opt to discontinue their friendship, the relationship will cease. This implies that their beliefs and actions will be incompatible, and their friendship will terminate. It is important to note that balance theory is not the only explanation for relationship dynamics; many other factors, such as the nature of the conflict, the individuals' communication skills, the type of relationship, and the context in which the conflict occurs, will all play a role in determining the outcome of the friendship. In summary, Balance theory says that individuals attempt to preserve balance in their relationships. Following a disagreement or conflict, the various outcomes for a friendship are: balance, imbalance, and disintegration. Balance indicates that the relationship will continue as usual, Imbalance indicates that the friendship will be characterized by tension or discomfort, and Dissolution indicates that the friendship will cease.
