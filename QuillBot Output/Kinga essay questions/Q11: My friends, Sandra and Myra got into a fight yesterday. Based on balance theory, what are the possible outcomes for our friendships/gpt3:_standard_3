According to the balance hypothesis, which is based on social psychology, individuals want to keep relationships in balance by adopting their friends' attitudes and actions. Balance, imbalance, and disintegration are the three potential outcomes for relationships after a quarrel or disagreement, according to balance theory. Balance will be restored to their relationship if Sandra and Myra can work out their differences and continue to show each other respect. Their attitudes and actions will be congruent with one another as a result, and their relationship will go on as usual. Imbalance: If Sandra and Myra can't work out their differences yet keep up their relationship, there can be an imbalance. In this situation, one or both parties may alter their views or actions in order to keep the connection, but the friendship will still be tense or uncomfortable. Dissolution: The relationship will end if Sandra and Myra are unable to overcome their disagreement and decide to call it quits on their friendship. This implies that their beliefs and actions will clash and that their friendship will collapse as a result. It's important to remember that the balance theory is not the only explanation for relationship dynamics; many other elements, including the nature of the conflict, the participants' communication skills, the type of relationship, and the environment in which the conflict occurs, will also affect how the friendship develops. In conclusion, the balance hypothesis suggests that individuals work to keep relationships in balance. After a disagreement or conflict, a friendship may become balanced, imbalanced, or dissolve. Balance indicates that the relationship will go on as usual, imbalance denotes that there will be tension or unease in the friendship, and disintegration denotes that the friendship will cease.
