According to balancing theory, when two friends, say Sandra and Myra, have a disagreement, the resolution may hinge on the relative number of positive and negative connections between them. As a result of the argument, Sandra and Myra may decide to no longer be friends with one other and avoid each other in the future. This may occur if the bad emotions caused by the argument are stronger than the happy emotions resulting from the friendship. An alternative possibility is that Sandra and Myra's friendship will continue, but at a diminished level of communication, trust, and closeness. This is a possible outcome if the disagreement is not resolved and the resulting negative emotions persist. The third possibility is that Sandra and Myra would become closer as friends as they learn to understand each other better after experiencing disagreement. This may occur if the good sentiments associated with the friendship return stronger than the bad ones brought on by the disagreement, once the issue has been resolved. That Sandra and Myra's relationship will remain mostly unchanged, with little to no shift in their degree of closeness, trust, or communication, is a fourth possibility. The level of disagreement must be low, or the friends must be able to work through it rapidly, for this to occur. It's worth noting that the balance between good and negative ties within the social network, and the character of other friendships within it, might also affect the result of the dispute. To illustrate, the negative impacts of the disagreement may be lessened and the relationship may even endure or grow if Sandra and Myra have other close friends who support them.
