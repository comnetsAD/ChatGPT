Balance theory is a social psychology theory that describes how individuals seek to keep their social connections balanced. According to balance theory, relationships are balanced when one person's attitudes, beliefs, and actions are congruent with those of another. When two individuals argue or disagree, this equilibrium is upset, and the relationship is said to be unbalanced. According to balancing theory, there are various conceivable outcomes for Sandra, Myra, and your friendship after their fight: Balance may be restored in Sandra and Myra's relationship by resolving their disagreement and returning to a condition of consistency in their attitudes, beliefs, and actions. Segregation: Sandra and Myra's relationship may break and they will no longer engage with one other, leading in segregation. This may occur when the relationship is seen too uneven to be worth the effort of restoring equilibrium. Triangulation: Sandra and Myra may seek assistance from others, such as you or other friends, in order to restore equilibrium to their relationship. Triangulation is a technique that may assist to reduce stress and restore equilibrium to a relationship. Persistence of imbalance: Sandra and Myra may choose to prolong their fight and keep their relationship lopsided. This may occur if the connection is deemed essential enough to continue despite the inequality. It's important to note that balance theory isn't the only way to explain social connections, and the results of any specific dispute or disagreement may be influenced by a variety of elements such as personality, setting, and other social dynamics.
