The concept of maintaining equilibrium in one's social interactions is the subject of a social psychology theory known as balance theory. This theory explains why individuals attempt to do so. According to the balance hypothesis, a relationship is considered balanced when the views, attitudes, and actions of one individual are congruent with those of the other individuals in the connection. This equilibrium is upset if there is contention or contention between two individuals, and the resulting relationship is referred to as being unbalanced because of this. Following their argument, there are a few different ways that Sandra, Myra, and your friendship might develop according to balancing theory. Here are some of the possibilities: Restoring equilibrium: If Sandra and Myra are able to reconcile their differences and return to a condition of consistency in their attitudes, beliefs, and actions, they may be able to restore equilibrium to their relationship and bring it back into equilibrium. The possibility exists that Sandra and Myra may decide to sever their relationship and will no longer communicate with one another, which would lead to segregation. This may occur if the connection is seen to be excessively unbalanced, and it is determined that the work required to restore equilibrium is not worthwhile. Triangulation: In order to reestablish harmony in their relationship, Sandra and Myra may decide to look for help from third parties such as yourself or other friends. This tactic, known as triangulation, may be useful in defusing the tension and bringing the relationship back into a state of equilibrium. Continuation of an unbalanced relationship: Sandra and Myra may decide to continue arguing with one another and to continue to keep their relationship in an unbalanced state. This may occur when the two parties involved in the relationship agree that the connection is significant enough to maintain despite the imbalance. It is important to keep in mind that the balance theory is not the only viable explanation for social relationships. The outcomes of any given conflict or disagreement can be influenced by a wide variety of factors, such as the personalities of those involved, the context in which it takes place, and other social dynamics.
