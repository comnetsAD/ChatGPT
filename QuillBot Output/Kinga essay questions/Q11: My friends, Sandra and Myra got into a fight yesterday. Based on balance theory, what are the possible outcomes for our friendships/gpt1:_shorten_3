Equilibrium theory outlines how humans seek social balance. Balance theory states that relationships are balanced when people share attitudes, ideas, and actions. A relationship is uneven when two individuals disagree or fight. Balance theory suggests many friendship outcomes after Sandra, Myra, and you fight: Balance: Sandra and Myra may reconcile by resolving their dispute and returning to consistency in their attitudes, beliefs, and practices. Segregation: Sandra and Myra may break up and segregate. If the connection is excessively unequal, it may not be worth fixing. Triangulation: You or other friends may help Sandra and Myra manage their relationship. Triangulation helps ease stress and restore equilibrium. Persistence of imbalance: Sandra and Myra may continue to fight and have an unequal relationship. If the connection is essential enough, it can survive the imbalance. Balance theory is not the primary explanation for social connections, and personalities, setting, and other social variables may impact conflict outcomes.
