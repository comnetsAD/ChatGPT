Balance theory is a social psychology theory that describes how individuals attempt to preserve equilibrium in their social connections. According to the principle of balance, relationships are balanced when one person's attitudes, beliefs, and actions are congruent with those of another. When there is a dispute or conflict between two individuals, this equilibrium is thrown off, and the relationship is said to be unbalanced. In accordance with balancing theory, there are a number of potential outcomes for the friendship between Sandra, Myra, and you after their fight: Sandra and Myra may reconcile and restore balance in their relationship by resolving their disagreement and returning to a consistent condition of attitudes, beliefs, and actions. Sandra and Myra may decide to break their relationship and cease interacting with one another, leading in segregation. This may occur when the connection is seen too unbalanced to warrant the effort required to restore equilibrium. To reestablish equilibrium in their relationship, Sandra and Myra may seek help from other parties, such as you or other friends. This is known as triangulation, and it may help defuse stress and restore equilibrium to the relationship. Sandra and Myra may opt to maintain an unequal relationship and prolong their quarrel. This may occur if the connection is deemed significant enough to continue despite the imbalance. Notably, balance theory is not the sole explanation for social connections, and the results of any specific dispute or disagreement may be influenced by a variety of variables, such as the personalities involved, the situation, and other social dynamics.
