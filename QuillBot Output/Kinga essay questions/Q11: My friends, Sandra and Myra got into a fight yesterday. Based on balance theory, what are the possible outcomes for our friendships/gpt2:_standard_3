According to the balance theory, the character of Sandra and Myra's other connections and the proportion of good and negative interactions in their social network may influence how their disagreement with one another turns out. Sandra and Myra's friendship can collapse as a result of the argument, and they might stop interacting with one another. This can occur if the argument produced more negative emotions than pleasant ones that were already present in the friendship. Another conclusion is that Sandra and Myra's friendship will endure, but with diminished levels of closeness, communication, and trust. This could occur if the disagreement is not addressed and the unfavorable emotions it caused persist. Thirdly, the dispute may actually deepen Sandra and Myra's relationship as they work through their differences and get a better understanding of one another. This may occur if the issue is resolved and the favorable emotions that existed in the friendship exceed the unfavorable emotions brought on by the conflict. A fourth scenario is that little will change in Sandra and Myra's friendship, meaning that their degree of closeness, trust, and communication will remain mostly unchanged. This could occur if the disagreement is not serious or if the friends can settle it quickly. It's important to note that the type of other connections within the social network and whether the balance of good and negative relationships is maintained or disturbed may also influence how the conflict plays out. For instance, if Sandra and Myra have other close friends who stand by them, the impact of the disagreement may be lessened and the likelihood of the relationship lasting longer or even strengthening may increase.
