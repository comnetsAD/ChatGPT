The concept of "balance" in interpersonal interactions is the subject of a social psychology theory called "balance theory." According to balancing theory, harmony exists between two people when their worldviews are congruent and they act in ways that reflect their shared values. An unbalanced relationship is one where there is disharmony between the partners as a result of disagreement or conflict. According to balancing theory, there are a few ways in which Sandra, Myra, and your friendship might develop after their fight: Sandra and Myra may be able to reestablish harmony in their relationship if they can work through their differences and adopt more congruent perspectives, values, and habits. There is a risk of segregation if Sandra and Myra decide to stop being friends and stop interacting with each other. This might happen if there is an imbalance in the relationship and if it is decided that working to fix it is not worthwhile. To reestablish harmony in their relationship, Sandra and Myra may turn to third parties like yourselves or mutual acquaintances for help (a process known as "triangulation"). Triangulation is a technique used to reduce conflict and bring harmony back into a partnership. It's possible that Sandra and Myra may opt to keep fighting and keep their relationship unbalanced. This may occur if both parties value the connection enough to keep it going despite the discrepancy. It's important to remember that balance theory is only one possible explanation for interpersonal dynamics, and that many elements, such as the personalities involved, the setting, and other social dynamics, may influence the resolution of a specific dispute or disagreement.
