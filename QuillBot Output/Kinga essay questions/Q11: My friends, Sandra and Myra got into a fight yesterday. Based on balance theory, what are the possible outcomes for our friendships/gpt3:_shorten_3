Balance theory is a social psychology theory that suggests individuals try to balance their relationships by matching their friends' attitudes and actions. Balance theory says relationships may balance, unbalance, or dissolve after a quarrel. Balance: If Sandra and Myra can overcome their argument and stay optimistic, their relationship will be restored. Their friendship and views will remain constant. Imbalance: If Sandra and Myra cannot settle their issue yet remain friends, an imbalance may arise. One or both people may adjust their views or actions to continue the connection, but the friendship will be tense or uncomfortable. Dissolution: Sandra and Myra will lose their friendship if they can't overcome their dispute. Their beliefs and actions will conflict, ending the connection. Balance theory is not the sole explanation of relationship dynamics, and other elements including the nature of the dispute, the persons' communication abilities, the kind of connection, and the setting in which the disagreement occurs will all affect the friendship's conclusion. According to balancing theory, following a quarrel or disagreement, a friendship might balance, unbalance, or dissolve. Balance suggests the relationship will continue, imbalance means tension or discomfort, and disintegration means the friendship will cease.
