Balance theory is a social psychology theory that claims individuals attempt to preserve equilibrium in their relationships by matching their attitudes and actions with those of their friends. There are three potential outcomes for relationships after a quarrel or conflict, according to the balance theory: equilibrium, imbalance, and disintegration. If Sandra and Myra are able to overcome their disagreement and keep good attitudes toward one another, the equilibrium in their friendship will be restored. This suggests that their views and actions will align, and their relationship will continue as usual. If Sandra and Myra are unable to overcome their disagreement yet keep their relationship, an imbalance may result. In this situation, one or both parties may modify their views or actions in order to preserve the connection, but the friendship will be distinguished by tension or discomfort. If Sandra and Myra cannot overcome their disagreement and opt to discontinue their friendship, the connection will collapse. This indicates that their views and actions will no longer be compatible, and their friendship will cease. It is important to note that balance theory is not the only explanation for the dynamics of relationships; many other factors, such as the nature of the conflict, the communication skills of the individuals, the type of relationship, and the context in which the conflict occurs, will also influence the outcome of the friendship. In conclusion, according to the Balance theory, individuals attempt to preserve equilibrium in their relationships, and the various outcomes for a friendship after a disagreement or conflict are equilibrium, imbalance, and disintegration. Balance indicates that the relationship will continue as usual. Imbalance indicates that the friendship will be characterized by stress or discomfort.
