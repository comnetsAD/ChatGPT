It's true and untrue. In the 1960s, Stanley Milgram performed the Milgram experiments to explore obedience to authority by asking participants to shock a "learner" (who was really a confederate of the researcher) in a lab. When directed by an authority person, a large number of Milgram participants were prepared to give the "learner" serious or even death electric shocks. The Milgram studies don't explain why the men in Christopher R. Browning's "Ordinary Men" (a novel about a reserve police battalion in the Holocaust) murdered so many people. "Ordinary Men" was not a scientific experiment and did not use electric shocks. Instead, they killed Jews and other minorities in the Holocaust. These men's background, setting, and motive were quite different from the Milgram experiment. However, the Milgram studies provide some insight into the psychological factors that may have influenced the individuals in "Ordinary Men." The tests demonstrate that individuals may be prepared to undertake unethical or even illegal things when ordered to by an authoritative person. This may explain how "Ordinary Men" could join in the Holocaust despite their atrocities. However, the Milgram experiments do not fully explain the men's conduct in "Ordinary Men," since social and historical background also had a part.
