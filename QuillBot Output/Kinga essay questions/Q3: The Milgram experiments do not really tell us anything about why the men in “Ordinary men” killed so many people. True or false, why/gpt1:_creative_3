False. In the 1960s, Stanley Milgram performed a series of studies to study subjects' propensity to obey authority and provide electric shocks to a confederate if told to do so by a researcher. The results of the Milgram experiments can shed light on the mechanisms of obedience and conformity that may have contributed to the actions of the men in "Ordinary Men" (a book by Christopher Browning that explores the actions of a unit of German reserve policemen during World War II), though the experiments were not designed with that purpose in mind. Many volunteers in the Milgram tests were prepared to give a confederate an electric shock at what they perceived to be lethal levels when directed to do so by an authority person. As a result, it seems that individuals are sometimes willing to follow the orders of authoritative leaders even though they are unethical. Browning claims in his book that the troops of Reserve Police Battalion 101 were not bad per such, but were eager to follow instructions and perpetrate atrocities because they felt it as their responsibility to do so. Although the Milgram tests did not look into how the men in "Ordinary Men" reacted to authority, they do provide light on the psychological factors that cause individuals to comply with orders and do things they would not otherwise do. Even while the Milgram studies had nothing to do with the events described in "Ordinary Individuals," they do provide light on the psychological processes of compliance and conformity that may have played a role in the behavior of the men described there.
