False. The goal of Stanley Milgram's studies, which were carried out in the 1960s, was to examine volunteers' readiness to deliver electric shocks to a conspirator when told to do so by an authority person. The results of the Milgram experiments can shed light on the mechanisms of obedience and conformity that may have contributed to the actions of the men in "Ordinary Men," a book by Christopher Browning that examines the actions of a unit of German reserve policemen during World War II. However, the Milgram experiments were not specifically designed to investigate the actions of the men in "Ordinary Men." The Milgram tests showed that when directed to do so by an authority person, many participants were prepared to give a confederate what they perceived to be deadly amounts of electric shock. This shows that despite their own moral convictions, individuals might have a tendency to follow authoritative persons. In his book, Browning makes the case that while the members of Reserve Police Battalion 101 were eager to carry out instructions and perpetrate atrocities because they believed it was their responsibility to do so, they were not intrinsically wicked. Because of this, even though the Milgram studies did not focus on the behavior of the individuals in "Ordinary Men," they do provide light on the psychological processes that might motivate people to submit to authority and carry out behaviors that they ordinarily would not contemplate. In conclusion, although though Milgram's tests are unrelated to the "Ordinary Guys" book, they do provide some light on the psychological processes behind obedience and conformity that could have influenced the behavior of the men in the book.
