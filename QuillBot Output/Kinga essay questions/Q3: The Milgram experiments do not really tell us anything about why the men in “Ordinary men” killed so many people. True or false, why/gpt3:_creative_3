False. Both the Milgram tests and Christopher Browning's book "Ordinary Men" provide light on the mental processes that might lead to people taking part in acts of murder and genocide. In the 1960s, psychologist Stanley Milgram performed a series of studies in which subjects were asked to deliver electric shocks to a confederate (an actor) when directed to do so by an authority person. This study demonstrated the importance of following orders and how easily external circumstances may trump an individual's moral compass and cause them to behave immorally. Ordinary Men, written by Christopher Browning and released in 1992, is a look at the experiences of one platoon of the German Reserve Police Battalion 101 during the Holocaust. Browning maintains that his unit's members were not innately bad or antisemitic, but rather "ordinary guys" who were carried away by the horrors of war and the homicidal practices of the Nazi dictatorship. Browning uses interviews and archival materials to show how the men's acts were impacted by authority, group dynamics, and a steady increase in violence. Though unrelated, the Milgram studies and Ordinary Men provide light on the inner workings of the minds of those who may be manipulated into acts of brutality and genocide. In the Milgram studies, we see how people will follow orders even though they know it's wrong, and in "Ordinary Men," we see how people may grow desensitized to violence and find ways to rationalize it as a result of group dynamics and the progressive escalation of violence.
