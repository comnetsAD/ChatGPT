False. The Milgram studies and Christopher Browning's book "Ordinary Men" both provide light on the psychological mechanisms that might motivate people to commit violent and genocidal actions. When asked to do so by an authority source, many volunteers in the 1960s Milgram studies were prepared to give electric shocks to a confederate (who was really an actor) even though the shocks may have been lethal. This study emphasized the importance of deferring to authority and how circumstances might take precedence over people's moral convictions and personal ideals. Christopher Browning's 1992 book "Ordinary Men" explores the acts of a section of the German Reserve Police Battalion 101 during the Holocaust. According to Browning, the members in the unit were "ordinary guys" who were drawn into the homicidal practices of the Nazi dictatorship and the war's conditions rather than being fundamentally bad or antisemitic. Browning demonstrates how the men's acts were impacted by deference to authority, group dynamics, and the steady escalation of violence via interviews and historical archives. Although "Ordinary Men" and the Milgram studies are unrelated, they both provide light on the psychological factors that might motivate people to do violent or genocidal actions. While "Ordinary Men" demonstrates how people may grow desensitized to violence and can excuse their conduct via group dynamics and the steady escalation of violence, the Milgram experiments show how allegiance to authority can cause people to perform immoral acts.
