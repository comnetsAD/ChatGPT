This is somewhat true and partially untrue. The Milgram studies, performed by Stanley Milgram in the 1960s, attempted to examine loyalty to authority by observing how individuals responded to directions to administer electric shocks to a "learner" (who was really a confederate of the experimenter) in a laboratory environment. When directed by an authority person, a large number of participants in the Milgram tests were prepared to administer what they saw to be harmful or even possibly death electric shocks to the "learner." However, the Milgram studies do not clearly explain why the men in Christopher R. Browning's "Ordinary Men" (a book that investigates the role of a reserve police battalion in the Holocaust) murdered so many people. The guys in "Ordinary Men" were not a part of a scientific experiment and no one was requesting electric shocks from them. As part of the Holocaust, they participated in the systematic slaughter of Jews and other minority groups. The background, location, and motives for these men's acts were drastically different from the Milgram experiment. Nevertheless, the Milgram experiments provide some insight into the psychological factors that may have influenced the conduct of the guys in "Ordinary Men." Experiments indicate that individuals may be prepared to participate in behaviors that they would ordinarily consider unethical or even unlawful if encouraged to do so by a person of authority. This may help explain how the men in "Ordinary Men" were able to engage in the Holocaust despite the heinous nature of their deeds. It is crucial to emphasize, however, that the Milgram experiments do not fully explain the conduct of the individuals in "Ordinary Men"; other elements, such as social and historical background, also played a part.
