False. The Milgram experiments and Christopher Browning's "Ordinary Men" illuminate the psychological mechanisms that might lead to violence and genocide. In the 1960s Milgram studies, a large number of subjects were ready to shock a confederate (an actor) when ordered by an authority person, even though the shocks were lethal. This study showed that adherence to authority and situational considerations may trump morality and principles. Christopher Browning's 1992 book "Ordinary Men" investigates German Reserve Police Battalion 101's Holocaust conduct. Browning claims that the unit's members were "regular guys" caught up in conflict and Nazi murderous programs. Browning shows how adherence to authority, group dynamics, and violent escalated affected the men's conduct via interviews and historical archives. Although unrelated, the Milgram studies and "Ordinary Men" provide light on the psychological processes that might lead to violence and genocide. "Ordinary Men" shows how group dynamics and the slow escalation of violence may desensitize people to violence and rationalize their conduct, while the Milgram experiments show how adherence to authority can lead to immorality.
