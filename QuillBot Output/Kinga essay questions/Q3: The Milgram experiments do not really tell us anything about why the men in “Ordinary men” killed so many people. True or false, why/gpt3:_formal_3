False. The Milgram studies and Christopher Browning's "Ordinary Men" both provide light on the psychological mechanisms that might drive people to commit acts of violence and genocide. Christopher Browning's 1992 book "Ordinary Men" analyzes the conduct of a unit of the German Reserve Police Battalion 101 during the Holocaust. Browning demonstrates via interviews and historical sources how adherence to leadership, group dynamics, and the steady escalation of violence shaped the men's conduct. Although the Milgram tests and "Ordinary Men" are not directly related, they both provide light on the psychological processes that might drive people to commit acts of violence and genocide. The Milgram studies explain how adherence to authority may lead to immoral behavior, but "Ordinary Men" demonstrates how people can grow desensitized to violence and rationalize their conduct via group dynamics and the progressive escalation of violence.
