False. Both the Milgram tests and Christopher Browning's book "Ordinary Men" give insight into the psychological mechanisms that might drive people to engage in acts of violence and genocide. The Milgram experiments, done in the 1960s, indicated that a large majority of volunteers were prepared to deliver electric shocks to a confederate (who was really an actor) when directed to do so by an authority person, even though the shocks may be lethal. The force of allegiance to authority and the potential of situational conditions to overcome people' moral views and personal values were underlined in this study. Christopher Browning's 1992 book "Ordinary Men" analyzes the conduct of a unit of the German Reserve Police Battalion 101 during the Holocaust. Browning contends that the soldiers in the unit were not intrinsically bad or antisemitic, but rather "ordinary guys" caught up in the events of war and the Nazi regime's homicidal objectives. Browning shows how allegiance to leadership, group dynamics, and the steady escalation of violence affected the men's conduct via interviews and historical sources. While the Milgram studies and "Ordinary Men" are not directly related, they both give insight into the psychological processes that might lead to humans engaging in acts of violence and genocide. The Milgram studies show how allegiance to authority may lead to immoral behavior, but "Ordinary Men" shows how people can grow desensitized to violence and rationalize their conduct via group dynamics and the progressive escalation of violence.
