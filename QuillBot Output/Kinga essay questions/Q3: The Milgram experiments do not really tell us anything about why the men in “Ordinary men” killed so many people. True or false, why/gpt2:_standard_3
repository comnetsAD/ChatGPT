This claim contains both genuine and incorrect information. The Stanley Milgram studies, carried out in the 1960s, examined how individuals would react to orders to administer electric shocks to a "learner" (who was really a confederate of the experimenter) in a laboratory environment. The experiments attempted to analyze obedience to authority. According to the results of the Milgram studies, a sizeable percentage of participants would follow an authority figure's orders to provide the "learner" with what they perceived to be harmful or even possibly fatal electric shocks. The men in "Ordinary Men," a book by Christopher R. Browning that explores the role of a unit of reserve police battalions in the Holocaust, murdered a lot of people, but the Milgram tests don't explicitly explain why. The guys in "Ordinary Men" were not instructed to administer electric shocks to any subjects, nor were they taking part in a scientific experiment. Instead, they were taking part in the Holocaust's methodical extermination of Jews and other minority groups. These men's activities differed significantly from those of the Milgram experiment in terms of their context, environment, and motive. However, the Milgram studies do provide some understanding of the psychological processes that could have influenced the behavior of the guys in "Ordinary Men." According to the research, when given orders by a superior, individuals may be prepared to do things that they would otherwise deem unethical or even illegal. This could provide some light on how the guys in "Ordinary Men" managed to take part in the Holocaust despite the atrocities of what they did. It is crucial to remember that other elements, such as the social and historical backdrop, also played a part in the behavior of the individuals in "Ordinary Men," and that the Milgram experiments do not provide a comprehensive explanation.
