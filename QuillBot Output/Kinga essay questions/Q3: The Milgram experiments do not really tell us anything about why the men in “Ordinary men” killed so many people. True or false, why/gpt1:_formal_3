False. In the 1960s, Stanley Milgram performed studies to explore loyalty to authority and the subjects' readiness to give electric shocks to a confederate when directed to do so by an authority person. While the Milgram experiments were not specifically designed to investigate the actions of the men in Christopher Browning's "Ordinary Men" (a book that examines the actions of a unit of German reserve policemen during World War II), the results can provide insight into the mechanisms of obedience and conformity that may have contributed to the men's actions. When directed by an authoritative person, several volunteers in the Milgram tests were willing to deliver to a confederate what they perceived to be harmful doses of electric shock. This indicates that individuals may be motivated to comply with authority figures even when it conflicts with their own moral values. In his book, Browning contends that the members of Reserve Police Battalion 101 were not intrinsically wicked, but were eager to accept commands and perpetrate atrocities because they saw it as their responsibility to do so. While the Milgram tests did not directly examine the conduct of the individuals in "Ordinary Men," they do give insight into the psychological reasons that might cause people to follow authority and perform activities they would not typically contemplate. In conclusion, while the Milgram studies are not directly connected to the book "Ordinary Characters," they do give insight into the psychological processes of obedience and conformity that may have influenced the conduct of the men in the book.
