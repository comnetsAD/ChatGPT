This statement is both true and incorrect. Stanley Milgram's Milgram experiments, done in the 1960s, attempted to explore loyalty to authority by analyzing how individuals would react to directions to apply electric shocks to a "learner" (who was really an experimenter's confederate) in a laboratory environment. When directed to do so by an authority person, a large number of participants were prepared to give what they saw to be harmful or even possibly death electric shocks to the "learner" in the Milgram tests. The Milgram studies, however, do not clearly answer why the men in "Ordinary Men" (a book by Christopher R. Browning that explores the role of a unit of reserve police battalions in the Holocaust) murdered so many people. The guys in "Ordinary Men" were not subjected to a scientific experiment or instructed to administer electric shocks to anybody. Instead, they were complicit in the Holocaust's methodical extermination of Jews and other minority groups. The context, place, and motive for these men's acts were drastically different from the Milgram experiment. However, the Milgram studies do provide some insight into the psychological factors that may have led to the men's conduct in "Ordinary Men." The tests demonstrate that when commanded by an authoritative person, individuals may be prepared to participate in behaviors that they would typically consider unethical or even unlawful. This might provide some light on how the guys in "Ordinary Men" were able to engage in the Holocaust despite the atrocities they committed. It is crucial to highlight, however, that the Milgram experiments do not give a comprehensive explanation for the men's conduct in "Ordinary Men," and that other elements, such as social and historical background, also played a part.
