False. Stanley Milgram's 1960s Milgram studies examined loyalty to authority and volunteers' willingness to shock a confederate when told to. The Milgram studies were not meant to study the soldiers in Christopher Browning's "Ordinary Men," a novel about a unit of German reserve cops during World War II, but they may provide light on the processes of obedience and conformity that may have influenced their behavior. When directed by an authority person, several Milgram participants were prepared to shock a confederate at unsafe levels. This implies that individuals may follow authoritative persons despite their morals. In his book, Browning claims that Reserve Police Battalion 101 members were not malevolent but eager to follow instructions and perpetrate crimes because they believed it was their responsibility to do so. Thus, although the Milgram studies did not particularly examine the conduct of "Ordinary Men," they did reveal the psychological factors that might cause individuals to follow authority and do activities they would not typically contemplate. In conclusion, although Milgram studies are not directly relevant to "Ordinary Men," they do provide light on psychological processes of obedience and conformity that may have influenced the book's characters.
