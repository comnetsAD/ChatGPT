To some extent, this is correct. In the 1960s, Stanley Milgram performed a series of experiments to investigate the concept of obedience to authority by testing participants' willingness to carry out a task that included administering electric shocks to a "learner" (who was really a confederate of the experimenter). Many test subjects in the Milgram tests were prepared to carry out the "teacher's" (authority figure's) instructions to administer electric shocks to the "learner," even if they thought doing so may endanger the "learner's" life. When it comes to the question of why the men in "Ordinary Men" (a book by Christopher R. Browning that investigates the part played by a unit of reserve police battalions in the Holocaust) murdered so many people, the results of the Milgram studies don't provide any clear answers. No one in "Ordinary Men" was subjected to an electric shock as part of a scientific investigation. Instead, they were taking part in the Holocaust's methodical killing of Jews and other minorities. These men's activities were quite different from the Milgram experiment in terms of context, setting, and motive. However, the psychological factors that may have contributed to the conduct of the guys in "Ordinary Men" are partially explained by the Milgram studies. The results of the trials imply that individuals are prepared to break their own moral codes when ordered to do so by a higher authority. This may help explain how the guys in "Ordinary Men" could take part in the Holocaust despite the horrors they saw. The Milgram experiments may provide light on some of the reasons for the men's behavior in "Ordinary Men," but they cannot account for all. Other elements, such as social and historical background, undoubtedly played a part.
