False. Stanley Milgram performed the Milgram experiments in the 1960s to explore loyalty to authority and participants' willingness to deliver electric shocks to a confederate when directed to do so by an authority person. While the Milgram experiments were not specifically designed to investigate the men in "Ordinary Men" (a book by Christopher Browning that explores the actions of a unit of German reserve policemen during World War II), the results of the experiments can provide insight into the mechanisms of obedience and conformity that may have contributed to the men in the book's actions. Many volunteers in the Milgram tests were willing to give what they perceived to be harmful amounts of electric shock to a confederate when directed to do so by an authority person. This implies that individuals are prone to obeying authoritative persons even when it contradicts their moral values. In his book, Browning contends that the members of Reserve Police Battalion 101 were not innately bad, but they were eager to accept commands and perpetrate atrocities because they viewed it as their responsibility to do so. While the Milgram tests did not directly explore the guys in "Ordinary Men," they do give insight into the psychological reasons that might cause people to follow authority and perform activities they would not ordinarily contemplate. In conclusion, although the Milgram studies are not directly connected to the book "Ordinary Men," they do give some insight into the psychological processes of obedience and conformity that might have played a role in the men's conduct in the book.
