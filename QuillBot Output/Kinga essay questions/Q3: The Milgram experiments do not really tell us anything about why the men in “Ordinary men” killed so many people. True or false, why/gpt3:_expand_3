False. The psychological mechanisms that may cause people to engage in acts of violence and genocide are discussed in both the Milgram experiments and the book "Ordinary Men" written by Christopher Browning. Both of these sources give insight into these topics. The Milgram experiments, which were carried out in the 1960s, demonstrated that a significant number of participants were willing to administer electric shocks to a confederate (who was actually an actor) when instructed to do so by a figure of authority, even when the shocks had the potential to cause death to the confederate. The findings of this study brought to light the importance of submitting to those in positions of authority as well as the capacity of external circumstances to trump the moral convictions and ideals held by people. The events that took place during the Holocaust are investigated in Christopher Browning's book "Ordinary Men," which was first released in 1992 and is titled after the German Reserve Police Battalion 101. Browning contends that the members of the unit were not inherently evil or antisemitic; rather, he contends that they were "ordinary men" who were swept up in the circumstances of war and the genocidal policies of the Nazi regime. Browning's argument is that the men in the unit were swept up in the circumstances of war and the genocidal policies of the Nazi regime. Browning explains how the men's acts were impacted by adherence to authority, group dynamics, and the steady escalation of violence via the use of interviews and historical sources. Even though the Milgram tests and "Ordinary Men" are not immediately related to one another, they both provide light on the psychological processes that might drive people to engage in acts of violence and genocide. This is true even if they are not directly connected. The Milgram experiments illustrate how obedience to authority can lead individuals to commit immoral acts, whereas the film "Ordinary Men" illustrates how individuals can become desensitized to violence and how they can justify their actions through group dynamics and the gradual escalation of violence. Both of these concepts are demonstrated through the experiments conducted by Stanley Milgram.
