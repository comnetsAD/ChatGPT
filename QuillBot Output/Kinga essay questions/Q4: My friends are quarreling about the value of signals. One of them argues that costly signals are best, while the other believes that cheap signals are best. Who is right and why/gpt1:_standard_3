The situation's context will determine the answer. Signals that are costly to make are those that demand a considerable outlay of the signaler's time, effort, or financial resources. On the other hand, low-cost signals are those that are created at a cheap cost. Given that the signaler must be prepared to commit a substantial amount of resources to producing the signal, expensive signals are often seen as more accurate indications of the signaler's underlying characteristics or talents. For instance, in the animal realm, huge antlers or vividly colored feathers are sometimes seen as expensive signals since they need a significant amount of energy to generate and maintain. These signals are trustworthy gauges of the animal's bodily well-being, which is crucial for luring a mate. On the other hand, cheap signals are those that are created at a low cost and may not be as accurate predictors of the signaler's underlying characteristics or skills. For instance, a loud call from an animal may be a simple signal that doesn't cost much energy to create, but it doesn't reveal much about the animal's wellbeing or physical state. The importance of signals in a human environment might change depending on the circumstance. Costly signals may sometimes be more beneficial since they show that the signaler is prepared to commit a substantial amount of resources to producing the signal. A applicant with a prominent degree or certification, for instance, is sending a pricey signal during a job interview that they have spent a substantial amount of money on obtaining the necessary credentials. On the other hand, because they are simple to create and may show that the signaler is accessible and pleasant, inexpensive signals like a grin or a funny joke may be more beneficial in a courting situation. In conclusion, depending on the circumstances, both expensive and inexpensive signals may be valuable. Cheap signals may be less trustworthy but are more accessible and convey a feeling of approachability, whereas expensive signals are often seen as more dependable indications of the signaler's underlying characteristics or talents.
