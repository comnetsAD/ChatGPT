It is dependent on the circumstances. Costly signals are those that require the signaler to expend considerable resources, such as time, energy, or money, to generate. In contrast, cheap signals are signals that are created at a low cost. Because the signaler must be willing to commit a large amount of resources to make the signal, costly signals are frequently seen as more trustworthy indications of the signaler's underlying attributes or talents. In the animal realm, for example, vividly colored plumage or huge antlers are sometimes seen as expensive signals since they take a substantial amount of energy to generate and maintain. These signals are accurate markers of the animal's physical state and health, both of which are vital in attracting a partner. Cheap signals, on the other hand, are low-cost signals that may be less trustworthy predictors of the signaler's underlying features or talents. In the animal realm, for example, a loud cry may be a cheap signal that doesn't cost a lot of energy to create, but it doesn't reveal much about the animal's physical state or health. The importance of signals in the human setting might change depending on the scenario. Costly signals are often more important since they suggest that the signaler is prepared to commit considerable resources in producing the signal. In a job interview, for example, an applicant with a prominent degree or certifications is sending a pricey signal that they have spent substantial money to get the needed credentials. Cheap signals, such as a grin or a humorous joke, on the other hand, may be more beneficial in a dating situation since they are quick to create and may imply that the signaler is accessible and pleasant. In conclusion, depending on the scenario, both expensive and inexpensive signals have value. Cheap signals may be less dependable, but they may be cheaply created and offer a feeling of approachability.
