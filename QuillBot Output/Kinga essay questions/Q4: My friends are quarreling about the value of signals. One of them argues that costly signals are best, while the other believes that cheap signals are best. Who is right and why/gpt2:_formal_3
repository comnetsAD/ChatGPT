It is difficult to determine who is correct in this debate due to the fact that the value of signals relies on the unique context and the objectives of the sender and receiver. Costly signals are signals that incur a large expense for the sender, such as the tail of a peacock. These forms of signals are often seen as more dependable indications of the sender's quality or fitness, given that the sender committed a substantial amount of resources in making the signal. A male peacock with a huge and colorful tail is more likely to be fit and healthy than one with a short and uninteresting tail. These signals are often employed in courting and mating displays. In contrast, inexpensive signals are those that incur little to no expense for the sender, such as a bird cry. These signals are often seen as less trustworthy indications of the quality or fitness of the sender since they are very simple to generate. Nonetheless, they may be advantageous in some circumstances. For instance, a bird's cry may be used to signal the presence of a predator, a food source, or to attract a partner. In general, expensive signals are more accurate indications of the quality or fitness of the sender, but they may be less adaptable and more susceptible to manipulation. However, inexpensive signals might be more adaptable and less susceptible to deceit. Therefore, it relies on the context and objectives of the sender and recipient. If the objective is to attract a mate, for instance, expensive signals may be more successful since they give more trustworthy information about the sender's quality or fitness. If the objective is to indicate the existence of a predator or a food supply, however, inexpensive signals may be more successful since they are more adaptable and less susceptible to deceit.
