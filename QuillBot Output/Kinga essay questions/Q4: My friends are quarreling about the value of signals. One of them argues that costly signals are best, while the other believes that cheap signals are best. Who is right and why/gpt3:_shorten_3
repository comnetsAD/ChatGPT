The circumstances surrounding a signal and the function it serves may both have an impact on its value. Both expensive signals and low-priced signals have their own set of benefits as well as drawbacks. A costly signal is one that requires a big investment from the sender, such as a massive show of courting or an aggressive display that might be harmful or unpleasant for the recipient. Examples of costly signals include the following: Because the sender of the signal has put a lot of effort into creating the signal, it is often believed that the signal is a more dependable indication of the sender's genuine intentions or capabilities. Only healthy and strong males are able to afford to grow such a tail, so it is a reliable indicator of genetic quality. For example, in the animal kingdom, a large and colorful tail on a male peacock is a costly signal that indicates the male's fitness. In addition, a large and colorful tail is a reliable indicator of genetic quality. On the other hand, cheap signals are signals that involve minimal investment from the signaler, such as a straightforward vocalization or a limited display of color. Examples of this kind of signal include a blinking light or a single color. Due to the fact that the sender of the signal has not put much effort into it, people tend to see these signals as less dependable indications of the sender's genuine intentions or capabilities. In the world of animals, for instance, the straightforward cry of a bird may serve as a low-cost communication that only communicates the presence of the bird but says very nothing about the genetic quality or fitness of the bird. In a nutshell, the answer relies on the setting in which the signal was received. Signals that are expensive to send may be trustworthy indications of the sender's genuine intents or capabilities; yet, these signals may be less prevalent or less accessible for particular signalers. On the other side, cheap signals are more prevalent and easily available, but they could not give as much information about the signaler's genuine goals or talents.
