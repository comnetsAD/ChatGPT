It is dependent on the circumstances surrounding the issue. The production of costly signals requires the signaler to commit a considerable quantity of resources, such as time, energy, or money. These resources may also be combined into monetary investments. On the other hand, signals that are said to be cheap are ones that are created at a low cost. Because the sender of the signal must be prepared to commit a large amount of resources in order to create the signal, expensive signals are often considered to be more trustworthy indications of the underlying characteristics or capabilities of the sender. For instance, in the animal realm, signals that take a considerable amount of energy to develop and maintain such as brilliantly colored plumage or enormous antlers are often seen as expensive. This is because animals need a lot of energy to produce and keep these features. These signals are accurate indications of the animal's physical state and health, both of which are essential components in the process of enticing a mate to an animal. On the other hand, cheap signals are signals that are generated at a low cost and may be less trustworthy indications of the signaler's underlying features or talents. These signals are referred to as "cheap" signals. For instance, in the animal world, a loud cry may be an inexpensive signal that does not need a considerable amount of energy to create, but it does not tell us very much about the animal's physical state or health. When applied to humans, the significance of signals might shift significantly depending on the circumstances. There are instances when expensive signals are more useful than others because they suggest that the signaler is ready to devote a considerable amount of resources in order to make the signal. During a job interview, for instance, an applicant who has a prominent degree or certifications sends a pricey signal that they have committed a considerable amount of time and effort to get the necessary credentials. On the other hand, in the context of dating, inexpensive signals like a grin or a humorous joke may be more important since they are simple to create and may imply that the signaler is nice and accessible. In conclusion, the value of expensive and inexpensive signals varies greatly depending on the circumstances surrounding the scenario. Cheap signals may be less trustworthy, but they are easier to make and provide an impression that the sender is approachable. Expensive signals, on the other hand, are often seen as being more reliable indications of the signaler's underlying characteristics or talents.
