It is conditional on the specifics of the circumstance. The production of costly signals requires the signaler to expend considerable effort in the form of time, energy, or money. On the other hand, low-cost signals are signals that can be generated with little effort. Because the signaler must be willing to devote so much into producing the signal, its quality is frequently seen as a more accurate reflection of the signaler's true nature and capabilities. In the animal realm, for instance, elaborate displays of coloration or disproportionately huge antlers are frequently seen as expensive signals due to the high metabolic costs associated with their production and upkeep. These signals reliably reflect the animal's physical state and health, both of which are critical in attracting a partner. On the other side, "cheap signals" are those that may be generated with little effort and expense, but which may be less accurate reflections of the signaler's true qualities and skills. In the animal realm, for instance, a loud cry doesn't provide much information about an animal's health or physical condition, while being a cheap signal that doesn't cost much energy to create. Signals' worth in human interactions may change with circumstance. Signals that require a lot of effort to make are sometimes more useful because they show that the signaler cares enough to spend a lot of money on it. In a job interview, for instance, an applicant with a prominent degree or credentials is sending a pricey signal that they have spent much in acquiring the necessary skills. Alternatively, in a dating situation, inexpensive signals like a grin or humorous joke may be more important since they are simple to create and may imply that the signaler is accessible and nice. In conclusion, the usefulness of expensive and inexpensive signals depends on the specifics of the given scenario. Cheap signals may be less trustworthy but are simple to make and provide the impression of approachability, whereas costly signals are often seen as more reliable indications of the signaler's underlying qualities or capabilities.
