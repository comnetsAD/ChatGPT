It depends on the situational environment. Costly signals are signals that demand a large investment of resources, such as time, energy, or money, on the part of the signaler. In contrast, inexpensive signals are signals that are created at a cheap cost. Costly signals are often seen as more trustworthy indications of the signaler's underlying qualities or talents, as the signaler must spend large resources to make the signal. For instance, in the animal realm, vividly colorful plumage or huge antlers are sometimes seen as expensive signals since they take a great deal of energy to generate and maintain. These signals are dependable markers of the animal's physical condition and health, both of which are crucial mate-attracting qualities. Cheap signals, on the other hand, are low-cost signals that may be less trustworthy predictors of the signaler's underlying features or talents. In the animal realm, for instance, a loud cry may be a cheap signal that doesn't need much energy to generate, but it doesn't reveal much about the animal's health or physical condition. Depending on the circumstances, the importance of signals in the human setting might change. Occasionally, expensive signals are more useful because they suggest that the signaler is willing to commit substantial resources to make the signal. In a job interview, for instance, an applicant with a prominent degree or credentials indicates that they have committed a substantial amount of money to get the necessary qualifications. In a dating situation, however, inexpensive signals like as a grin or a humorous remark may be more important since they are simple to create and may imply that the signaler is accessible and pleasant. In conclusion, both costly and inexpensive signals have value depending on the situational context. In general, expensive signals are seen as more reliable indications of the signaler's underlying qualities or talents, while inexpensive signals may be less reliable but are simple to make and convey a feeling of approachability.
