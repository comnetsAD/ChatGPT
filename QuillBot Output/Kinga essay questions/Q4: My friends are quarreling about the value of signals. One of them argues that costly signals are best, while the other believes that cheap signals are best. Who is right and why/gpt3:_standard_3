Signal context and intent may both affect how valuable a signal is. Both expensive and inexpensive signals have benefits and drawbacks. Costly signals are those that need a big financial outlay from the signaler, such a big aggressive exhibition or a big show of wooing. These signals are often seen as more accurate representations of the signaler's actual intentions or skills since the signaler put a lot of effort into creating it. In the animal kingdom, a male peacock's enormous, colorful tail is an expensive signal that signals the male's fitness. It is also a trustworthy predictor of genetic quality since only fit, robust males can afford to produce a tail of this size and color. Contrarily, low-cost signals are those that demand minimal effort from the signaler, such as a straightforward vocalization or a little use of color. Because the signaler hasn't put much effort into the signal, these signals are often seen as less accurate indications of the signaler's genuine intentions or skills. In the animal kingdom, for instance, a bird's basic cry might be a subpar signal that merely shows that the bird is there and says nothing about its fitness or genetic makeup. In summary, it relies on the signal's context. Costly signals may be less frequent or more difficult for certain signalers to obtain, but they may be trustworthy indications of the signaler's genuine intents or talents. On the other hand, inexpensive signals are more prevalent and available but could not reveal as much about the signaler's genuine intentions or capabilities.
