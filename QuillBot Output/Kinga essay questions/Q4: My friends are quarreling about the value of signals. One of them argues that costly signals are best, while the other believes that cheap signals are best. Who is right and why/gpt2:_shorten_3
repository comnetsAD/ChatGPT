Signal value relies on context and sender/receiver intentions, making this debate difficult to resolve. Peacock tails are costly messages. Because the sender spent a lot of time and money on the signal, it's usually a better indication of their quality or fitness. A male peacock with a huge, colorful tail is healthier than one with a tiny, drab tail. Courtship and mating employ these signals. Bird calls are examples of inexpensive signals. Because they're simple to make, these signals don't usually indicate the sender's quality or fitness. In certain cases, they're helpful. Bird calls may warn of predators, food, or mates. Costly signals are more trustworthy but less adaptable and deceptive. Cheap signals are less dependable yet more adaptable and less deceptive. Thus, it relies on context and sender/receiver intentions. Costly signals may be better in attracting mates because they convey more accurate information about the sender's quality or fitness. Cheap signals are more adaptable and less deceptive, making them better for communicating the presence of a predator or food source.
