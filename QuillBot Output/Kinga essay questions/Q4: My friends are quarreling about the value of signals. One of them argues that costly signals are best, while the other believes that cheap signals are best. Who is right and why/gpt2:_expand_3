Because the significance of signals is dependent on the particular environment in which they are used and the objectives of both the sender and the receiver, it is difficult to determine which side of this debate is in the right. A peacock's tail is an example of a costly signal, which refers to a signal that the sender must incur a large expense to convey. Because the sender has put a large amount of resources into making the signal, it is widely agreed that these kinds of signals are more trustworthy indications of the quality or fitness of the sender. For instance, a male peacock that has a long tail that is brightly colored is more likely to be in good physical shape than a male peacock that has a short tail that is colorless. These signals are often employed in mating displays as well as in the wooing process. On the other hand, inexpensive signals are signals that arrive at a low cost or perhaps no cost to the sender at all. An example of this would be a bird call. Due to the fact that it is not very difficult to manufacture these kinds of signals, they are often regarded to be less accurate indications of the quality or fitness of the sender. Nevertheless, there are still situations in which they may be helpful. For instance, a bird's cry may be used to warn of the proximity of a potential threat, such as another animal or a source of food, or it may be used to entice a potential partner. Costly signals are, in general, more trustworthy indications of the quality or fitness of the sender; but, they may be less adaptable and more prone to trickery. Cheap signals, on the other hand, are not as dependable as other indications, but they may be more adaptable and less susceptible to being misled. Therefore, it is dependent on the circumstances as well as the objectives of both the sender and the recipient. For instance, if the objective is to attract a mate, expensive signals may be more successful because they convey more trustworthy information about the quality or fitness of the sender. But if the objective is to convey the location of a potential threat, such as a predator or a source of food, then less expensive signals may prove to be more successful since they are more adaptable and less likely to be tricked.
