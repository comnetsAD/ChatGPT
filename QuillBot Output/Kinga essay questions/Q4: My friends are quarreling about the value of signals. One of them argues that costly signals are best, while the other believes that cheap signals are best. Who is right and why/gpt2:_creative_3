Given that a signal's worth is determined by both its context and the aims of its sender and recipient, it's hard to tell who has the upper hand in this discussion. The peacock's tail is an example of a costly signal since it requires a high price to be paid by the sender. Because the sender has put so much effort into making the signal, it is often seen as a more credible indication of the sender's quality or fitness. A male peacock with a long, brightly colored tail, for instance, is probably in better shape than one with a shorter, less flashy tail. Mating rituals and wooing rituals sometimes include the usage of such signals. But inexpensive signals, like a bird's song, cost the sender very nothing, if anything at all. These signals are often less trusted as indications of the sender's quality or fitness since they may be generated by almost anybody. They do, however, have their uses. A bird's cry, for instance, may be used to warn of danger, alert others to food availability, or woo a potential spouse. While expensive signals are often more accurate indications of the sender's quality or fitness, they also tend to be less malleable and more prone to deceit. However, low-cost signals may be more adaptable and resistant to deception than their more expensive counterparts. Therefore, it is dependent upon the situation and the intended outcomes for both the sender and the recipient. For sexual attraction, when accuracy is paramount, expensive signals may be the best option due to the superior information they provide about the sender's quality or health. But if you want to alert others to the presence of a predator or a food source, low-cost signals may be more useful since they are more malleable and less likely to be tricked.
