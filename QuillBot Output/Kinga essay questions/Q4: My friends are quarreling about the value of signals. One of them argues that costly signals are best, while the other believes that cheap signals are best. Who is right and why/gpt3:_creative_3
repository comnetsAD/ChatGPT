It's important to consider the context and the signal's intended use when assessing its worth. There are benefits and drawbacks to both expensive and low-cost signals. Extensive displays of courting or aggressive behavior that might cause harm to the signaler are examples of costly signals. Since the signaler has put so much effort into it, it is more likely to be an accurate reflection of the signaler's genuine goals or talents. A big and colorful tail in male peacocks is an expensive signal that signals the male's fitness and is a dependable measure of genetic quality since only healthy and strong males can afford to produce such a tail. On the other hand, cheap signals are those that involve minimal effort on the part of the signaler, such as a short vocalization or a splash of color. Given the low level of emotional investment from the sender, it is assumed that these signals are less indicative of the sender's genuine goals or talents. A bird's cry, for instance, may serve as a low-cost communication in the animal kingdom, indicating the presence of the bird but saying nothing about its ancestry or fitness. Finally, the signal's context is critical. Some signalers may not have ready access to more expensive signals, despite the fact that they may be trustworthy indications of the signaler's genuine intents or ability. In contrast, inexpensive signals are easier to get by, but they may not be as informative about the signaler's genuine intents or capabilities.
