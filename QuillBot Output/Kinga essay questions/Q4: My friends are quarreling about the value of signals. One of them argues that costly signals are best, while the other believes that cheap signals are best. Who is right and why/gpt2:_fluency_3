It is impossible to establish who is correct in this debate since the significance of signals relies on the unique circumstances as well as the sender and receiver's aims. Costly signals, such as the peacock's tail, are messages that come at a high expense to the sender. Because the sender has committed substantial resources in creating the signal, these sorts of signals are often seen as more dependable indications of the sender's quality or fitness. A male peacock with a huge and bright tail, for example, is more likely to be fit and healthy than a male peacock with a short and drab tail. These signals are often employed in courting and mating displays. Cheap signals, on the other hand, are signals that cost the sender nothing or nothing, such as a bird cry. Because they are relatively simple to make, these signals are often seen as less trustworthy indications of the sender's quality or fitness. They may, however, be advantageous in some situations. A bird cry, for example, might be used to signal the presence of a predator or a food source, or to attract a partner. In general, more expensive signals are more trustworthy indications of the sender's quality or fitness, but they are less flexible and more susceptible to trickery. Cheap signals, on the other hand, are less dependable indications, but they are more adaptable and less susceptible to manipulation. As a result, it is dependent on the context as well as the sender's and receiver's aims. If the objective is to attract a mate, for example, more expensive signals may be more successful since they convey more accurate information about the sender's quality or fitness. However, if the purpose is to indicate the presence of a predator or a food supply, inexpensive signals may be more successful since they are more adaptable and less susceptible to deceit.
