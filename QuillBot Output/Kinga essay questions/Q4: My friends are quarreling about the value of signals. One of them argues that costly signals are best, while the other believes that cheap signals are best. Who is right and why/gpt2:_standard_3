The significance of signals relies on the particular situation and the objectives of the sender and the recipient, making it impossible to determine who is correct in this debate. Costly signals, like the peacock's tail, are ones that the sender must pay a high price to communicate. Because the sender has spent a large amount of resources on creating the signal, these signals are often seen as more accurate indications of the sender's quality or fitness. For instance, a male peacock with a huge, vibrant tail is more likely to be in better physical shape and overall better health than one with a short, dull tail. These signals are often employed during courting and mating rituals. Cheap signals, on the other hand, are those that the sender incurs little or no expense to convey, like a bird cry. Because they are very simple to make, these signals are often seen as less accurate indications of the sender's quality or fitness. They may yet be helpful in certain circumstances. A bird cry, for instance, might be used to signal the presence of a predator, a food source, or to entice a partner. Costly signals tend to be less adaptable and more susceptible to fraud, but they are generally more accurate indications of the sender's quality or fitness. Cheap signals, on the other hand, might be more adaptable and less susceptible to fraud but are less trustworthy as indications. Therefore, it depends on the situation and the parties' objectives. For instance, expensive signals may be more successful if the objective is to entice a mate since they provide more trustworthy information about the sender's quality or fitness. However, since they are more adaptable and less susceptible to trickery, inexpensive signals could be more successful if the objective is to announce the existence of a predator or a food supply.
