The value of a signal might vary depending on its context and intent. Both expensive and inexpensive signals have benefits and downsides. Costly signals, such as a major exhibition of courting or a risky or painful demonstration of hostility, need a considerable commitment from the signaler. Because the signaler has spent so much in the signal, these signals are typically seen as more trustworthy indications of the signaler's genuine intentions or talents. A huge and colorful tail of a male peacock, for example, is an expensive signal that signals the male's fitness, and it's also a dependable predictor of genetic quality since only healthy and robust males can afford to produce such a tail. Cheap signals, on the other hand, demand minimal commitment from the signaler, such as a basic vocalization or a modest color display. Because the signaler has spent little in the signal, these signals are typically seen as less dependable indications of the signaler's genuine intentions or talents. In the animal world, for example, a basic bird cry may be a low-cost communication that just tells that the bird is there, but not much about its genetic quality or fitness. Finally, it is dependent on the signal's context. Costly signals may be accurate indications of the signaler's genuine intents or talents, although they may be less frequent or more difficult for particular signalers to get. Cheap signals, on the other hand, are more widespread and accessible, but they may not reveal as much about the signaler's genuine goals or talents.
