The value of signals might vary depending on their context and function. Both expensive and inexpensive signals have their benefits and limitations. Costly signals are those that demand a substantial investment on the part of the signaler, such as a huge show of courting or a risky or painful demonstration of aggressiveness. These signals are often seen as more dependable indications of the signaler's genuine intentions or talents, due to the signaler's substantial investment in the signal. In the animal kingdom, a huge and colorful tail on male peacocks is an expensive symbol of fitness and a dependable diagnostic of genetic quality, since only strong and healthy males can afford to produce such a tail. In contrast, inexpensive signals are those that take little effort from the signaler, such as a simple vocalization or a modest display of color. These signals are often seen as less accurate indications of the sender's genuine intentions or capabilities, given the sender has placed less effort into the signal. In the animal kingdom, for instance, a bird's basic cry may be a cheap communication that only conveys the presence of the bird, but not much about its genetic quality or fitness. In conclusion, it relies on the signal's context. Costly signals may be trustworthy indications of the sender's genuine intents or capabilities, although they may be uncommon or inaccessible for some senders. Cheap signals, on the other hand, are more prevalent and accessible, but they may not reveal as much about the sender's genuine intents or capabilities.
