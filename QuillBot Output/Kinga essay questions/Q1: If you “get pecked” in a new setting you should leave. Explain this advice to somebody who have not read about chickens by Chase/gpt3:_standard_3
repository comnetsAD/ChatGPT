This suggestion is based on an idea from Gail Damerow's book "Chickens: Taming and Training." The book offers guidance on how to treat the chickens in various circumstances and is about rearing hens. When a chicken strikes or pecks at another chicken, it is said to "get pecked." Chickens may be more inclined to peck at one another when they are in an unfamiliar environment, such as a new coop or flock, as they work to establish a pecking order. If you witness a chicken pecking at another, it's essential to separate them right away since the pecking might grow out of hand and hurt the chickens. This is what it means to "leave if you get pecked." To avoid major injury to their hens, it is advised that poultry keepers observe how the birds interact and respond quickly if they see violent behavior.
