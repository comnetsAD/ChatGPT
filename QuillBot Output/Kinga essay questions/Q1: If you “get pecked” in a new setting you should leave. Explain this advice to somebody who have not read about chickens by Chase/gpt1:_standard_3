When someone or a group of people "gets pecked," it means that they are being singled out and bullied by other people. When used to chickens, it denotes that one of the flock's members is being singled out for assault by other birds. In this circumstance, the advise to "leave" refers to removing oneself from the circumstance or setting where the bullying is taking place. This might be accomplished by physically relocating away from the aggressor(s) or by utterly withdrawing from the group or environment. It would include removing the targeted chicken from the flock, giving it a separate coop or enclosure to dwell in, and keeping an eye on its health and wellbeing. The rationale behind this suggestion is that being the target of persistent bullying may have a significant impact on a person's physical and mental health. By leaving the setting, the person may prevent future damage and perhaps find a more encouraging and supportive atmosphere.
