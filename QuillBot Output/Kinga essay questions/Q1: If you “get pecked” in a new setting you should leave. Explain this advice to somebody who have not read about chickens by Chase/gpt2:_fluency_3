Gail Damerow's book "The Chicken Health Handbook" inspired this suggestion. According to the author, if a new chicken is brought to a flock and is pecked by the other chickens, the new chicken should be removed from the flock since it is likely to be bullied and may not be welcomed into the group. Pecking may cause harm or even death. It is advisable to prevent this situation by properly introducing the new chicken to the flock and allowing it to establish its position in the group before being pecked. Because every scenario is different, this is only a general rule of thumb rather than a hard and fast rule.
