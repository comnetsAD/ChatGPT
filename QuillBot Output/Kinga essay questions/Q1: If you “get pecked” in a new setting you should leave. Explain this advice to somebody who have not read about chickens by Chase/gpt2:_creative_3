This recommendation alludes to a theory presented in Gail Damerow's The Chicken Health Handbook. According to the author, a new chicken brought to a flock and subsequently pecked by the other chickens is best removed from the flock since it is likely to be bullied and may not be welcomed into the group. The pecking might cause serious harm or possibly kill the bird. To prevent this from happening, young chickens should be introduced to the flock in a controlled environment where they may learn the social norms and establish their position in the flock before being picked on. Every circumstance is unique, so consider this more of a guideline than a strict regulation.
