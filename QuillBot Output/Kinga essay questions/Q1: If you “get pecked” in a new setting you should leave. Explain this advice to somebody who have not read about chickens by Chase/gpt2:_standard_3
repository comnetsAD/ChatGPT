This recommendation makes use of a notion from Gail Damerow's book "The Chicken Health Handbook." According to the author, it is better to remove a new chicken from a flock if it is introduced to the flock and is pecked by the other chickens since it is likely to be bullied and may not be welcomed into the group. Pecking might result in harm or even death. It is ideal to prevent this situation by providing the new chicken a good introduction to the flock and a chance to settle in before it is attacked. This is just a broad guideline and not a set rule since every circumstance is unique.
