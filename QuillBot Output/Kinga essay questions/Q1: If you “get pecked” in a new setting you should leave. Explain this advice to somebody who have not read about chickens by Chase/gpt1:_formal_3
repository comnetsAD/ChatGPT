The expression "get pecked" refers to a scenario in which a person or group of people are targeted and bullied by others. In the context of chickens, it indicates that one chicken is being singled out and assaulted by other birds. In this case, the advise to "leave" refers to withdraw oneself from the context or setting in which bullying is happening. This may be accomplished by physically separating oneself from the aggressor(s) or by leaving the group or environment. In the case of chickens, this would include separating the targeted bird from the flock, providing it with a separate coop or cage, and monitoring its health and well-being. The rationale behind this recommendation is that being subjected to persistent bullying may have significant impacts on a person's physical and mental health. By removing oneself from the circumstance, a person might prevent future injury and perhaps find a more positive and helpful setting.
