The circumstance described by the expression "get pecked" refers to an instance in which a person or group of individuals is being picked out and bullied by other people. When referring to a flock of chickens, this phrase indicates that one bird in the flock is being singled out and attacked by the other chickens. When given in this context, the advise to "leave" suggests that one should remove themselves from the setting or environment in which the bullying is taking place. To do this, one may either physically move away from the aggressor(s) or remove themselves entirely from the group or situation in which they are being harassed. In the context of chickens, this would include removing the bird in question from the rest of the flock, providing it with its own coop or cage, and ensuring that its health and well-being are closely monitored. This piece of advise is grounded on the understanding that being exposed to persistent bullying may have a harmful impact on an individual's physical as well as mental health and should be avoided at all costs. By removing themselves from the precarious circumstance, a person may protect themselves from suffering more injury and increase their chances of discovering a more positive and encouraging setting.
