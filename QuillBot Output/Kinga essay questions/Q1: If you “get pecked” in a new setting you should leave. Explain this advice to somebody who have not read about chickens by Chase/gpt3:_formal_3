This recommendation references an idea from Gail Damerow's book "Chickens: Taming and Training." The book is about rearing chickens and provides guidance on how to treat the birds in various circumstances. This expression is used to describe when a chicken strikes or pecks at another fowl. As they establish a pecking order in a new environment, such as a new coop or flock, hens may be more prone to peck at each other. The recommendation to leave if you "get pecked" suggests that if you witness one chicken pecking at another, it is better to remove them quickly, since the pecking might grow and inflict harm to the birds. To avoid significant injury to their chickens, it is recommended that the keeper observe the relationship between the birds and react quickly if they see violent behavior.
