"Chickens: Taming and Training" by Gail Damerow inspired this suggestion. Chicken-raising guidance included in the book. "Get pecked" means a chicken attacks another chicken. Chickens may fight more in a new coop or flock as they establish a pecking order. If you "get pecked," leave immediately since one chicken pecking at another may escalate and hurt the birds. To avoid major injury to their birds, poultry keepers should study the birds' interactions and respond early if they notice aggressive behavior.
