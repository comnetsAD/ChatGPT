This piece of guidance makes reference to a theory that is presented in Gail Damerow's book "The Chicken Health Handbook." According to the author, if a new chicken is brought into a flock and it is pecked by the other chickens in the flock, it is best to remove the new chicken from the flock because it is likely to be bullied and may not be accepted into the group. This is because the other chickens may not accept it into the group. The constant pecking has a risk of causing serious harm or perhaps death. It is preferable to prevent this situation by introducing the new chicken to the flock in the correct manner, allowing it the opportunity to establish its position in the group before beginning to pick on it. This is only a general rule of thumb and not a rule that must be followed exactly since each circumstance is unique.
