"The Chicken Health Handbook" by Gail Damerow inspired this suggestion. The author advises removing a baby chicken from a flock if it is pecked by the other chickens since it may be bullied and rejected. Pecking may kill. To prevent this, properly introduce the new chicken to the herd before pecking it. Every circumstance is different, therefore this is only a rule of thumb.
