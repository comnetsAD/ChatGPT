This advise is based on an idea from the book "Chickens: Taming and Training" by Gail Damerow. The book is about rearing chickens and offers tips on how to deal with the birds in various scenarios. When a chicken pecks at or assaults another chicken, the term "get pecked" is used. Chickens may be more inclined to peck at each other in a new environment, such as a new coop or flock, as they establish a pecking order. If you witness one chicken pecking at another, it's better to remove them quickly since the pecking might grow and inflict harm to the birds. To avoid major injury to their birds, poultry keepers should observe their birds' interactions and respond early if they see aggressive behavior.
