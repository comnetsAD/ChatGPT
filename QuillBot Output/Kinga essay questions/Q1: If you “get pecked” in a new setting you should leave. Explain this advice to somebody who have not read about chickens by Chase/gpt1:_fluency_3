The expression "get pecked" refers to a scenario in which a person or group of people is picked out and bullied by others. In the context of chickens, it signifies that one bird in the flock is being targeted and assaulted by other chickens. In this case, the advise to "leave" refers to remove oneself from the context or setting where the bullying is taking place. This may be accomplished by physically moving away from the aggressor(s) or by withdrawing from the group or setting entirely. In the case of chickens, this would include separating the targeted bird from the flock, providing it with its own coop or cage, and monitoring its health and well-being. The logic for this advise is that being bullied on a regular basis may have a significant impact on an individual's physical and mental health. By distancing oneself from the circumstance, the person might perhaps prevent more injury and find a more positive and helpful setting.
