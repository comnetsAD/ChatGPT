This piece of guidance makes reference to a theory that may be found in a book written by Gail Damerow titled "Chickens: Taming and Training." The book provides guidance on how to manage hens in a variety of settings and is about rearing chickens. When one chicken strikes or pecks at another chicken, it is said to "get pecked," which is a word that describes the incident. It is possible that chickens will be more prone to peck at each other in a new environment, such as a new coop or a new flock, as they attempt to establish a pecking order. If you notice one chicken pecking at another, it is advisable to separate them quickly since the pecking may increase and inflict harm to the birds. The recommendation to leave if you "get pecked" suggests that if you witness one chicken pecking at another, it is preferable to remove them immediately. It is important for the person who keeps the chickens to keep an eye on how the birds interact with one another and to step in immediately if they see any aggressive behavior in order to avoid causing any significant injuries to their hens.
