The source of this recommendation is Gail Damerow's book "Chickens: Taming and Training," which contains the aforementioned premise. The book discusses how to care for chickens in a variety of settings and offers tips for rearing healthy, happy hens. When one chicken strikes or pecks at another chicken, the victim is said to "get pecked." Chickens may be more aggressive against one another when they are in an unfamiliar environment, such as a new coop or flock, and are trying to establish dominance hierarchies. If you notice one chicken pecking at another, it is essential to remove them quickly to prevent the pecking from escalating and injuring the birds, as implied by the phrase "get pecked," which advises you to leave if you experience this unpleasant situation. If the keeper of chickens is concerned that any of their birds may be in danger, he or she should keep a close eye on how the hens interact with one another and respond quickly if they see violent behavior.
