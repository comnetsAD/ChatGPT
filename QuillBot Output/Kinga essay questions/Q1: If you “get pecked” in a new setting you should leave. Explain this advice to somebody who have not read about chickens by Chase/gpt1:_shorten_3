"Get pecked" is to be picked out and bullied. In chickens, it indicates the flock is attacking one bird. "Leave" signifies leaving the bullying scenario. Moving away from the aggressor(s) or leaving the group or environment may achieve this. It would require separating the targeted chicken from the herd, giving it a separate coop or enclosure, and monitoring its health. Bullying may harm one's physical and emotional health, hence this advise is given. By leaving, the person might prevent future damage and perhaps find a more supportive setting.
