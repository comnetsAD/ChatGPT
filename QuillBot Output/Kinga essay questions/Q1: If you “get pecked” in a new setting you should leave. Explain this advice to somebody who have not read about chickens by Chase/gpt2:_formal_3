This recommendation references an idea from Gail Damerow's "The Chicken Health Handbook." The author adds that if a new chicken is brought to a flock and it is pecked by the other chickens, the new chicken should be removed since it is likely to be bullied and may not be welcomed into the group. The pecking might result in harm or death. It is ideal to prevent this situation by properly introducing the new chicken to the flock, allowing it to establish its position within the group prior to being pecked. This is a broad rule of thumb, not a hard and fast guideline, since every circumstance is unique.
