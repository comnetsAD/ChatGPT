When someone or some group is "being pecked," it means they are being picked on or harassed by others. This phrase has chicken-specific meaning: one bird in the flock is picking on and attacking another chicken. For purposes of this discussion, "leave" refers to physically leaving the location where bullying is taking place. Moving away from the aggressor(s) is one option, but leaving the group or the situation entirely is also effective. In the case of hens, this would include isolating the affected bird from the rest of the flock, providing it with its own coop or enclosure, and keeping a close eye on its well-being. The rationale for this recommendation is that being subjected to bullying on a regular basis may have detrimental impacts on a person's physical and mental health. Leaving the circumstance is a way to protect yourself from additional damage and look for a new, more positive and helpful setting.
