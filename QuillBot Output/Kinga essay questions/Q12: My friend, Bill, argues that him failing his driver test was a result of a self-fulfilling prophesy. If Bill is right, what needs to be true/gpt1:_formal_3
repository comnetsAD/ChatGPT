If Bill is correct in his assertion that his failure on the driver's exam was the consequence of a self-fulfilling prophesy, then the following must be true: Before taking the exam, Bill must have assumed he would not pass. This view may have been influenced by previous encounters, expectations, or preconceptions. Bill's actions or attitude towards the exam must have been altered by his idea that he would fail. For instance, he may have prepared for the exam with less effort or experienced anxiety or tension throughout the exam. Bill's actions or attitude towards the examination must have affected his performance. For instance, if he did not rehearse enough or was too stressed to concentrate on the test, this may have hindered his performance. The failing of the examination must have stemmed from the negative beliefs and actions. Self-fulfilling prophesies are not necessarily bad; they may also be good, in which the idea that one will achieve leads to actions and behaviors that result in success. It is also essential to remember that self-fulfilling prophesies are not the sole cause of failure. Lack of awareness of the laws and regulations, ineffective test-taking tactics, or simply a lousy day may have also contributed to the failure of the exam. It is essential to discover the underlying reason of the failure and work to eliminate it for future success.
