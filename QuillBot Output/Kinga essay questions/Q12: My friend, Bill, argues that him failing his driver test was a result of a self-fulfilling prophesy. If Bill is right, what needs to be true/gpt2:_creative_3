Bill must satisfy a number of conditions in order for his self-fulfilling prophecy theory to account for his failed driving test. Before taking the exam, Bill must have assumed he would do poorly. It's possible that this opinion was formed as a result of prior exposure, assumptions, or preconceived notions. Bill's conduct and attitude toward the exam likely suffered because of his expectation that he would do poorly on it. Perhaps he didn't study as hard as he should have, or he panicked or felt stressed out when taking the exam. It's likely that Bill's exam performance was affected by his attitude or conduct. Possible explanations include insufficient preparation or anxiety that prevented him from concentrating on the work at hand. Undoubtedly, the poor performance on the exam was due to the candidate's pessimistic outlook and actions. It's important to remember that self-fulfilling prophesies aren't all doom and gloom, and may be good when a person's confidence in their own achievement motivates them to take the steps necessary to actually achieve that accomplishment. Self-fulfilling prophesies aren't the only thing to blame when things don't work out. Lack of preparation, incorrect test-taking tactics, or even simply having a terrible day may all play a role in a low performance on a standardized exam. Finding the source of the failure and fixing it is crucial for moving forward.
