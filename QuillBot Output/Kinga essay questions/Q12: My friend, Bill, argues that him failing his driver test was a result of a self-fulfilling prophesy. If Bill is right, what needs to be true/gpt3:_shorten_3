If Bill is accurate that his driving test failure was a self-fulfilling prophesy, many things must be true: Bill must have expected to fail before taking the exam. Experiences, expectations, and preconceptions may have shaped this view. Bill's concern that he would fail must have influenced his test performance. He may have studied less or felt apprehensive throughout the examination. Bill's test performance was affected by his attitude. He may have performed poorly if he didn't study enough or was too nervous to follow instructions. Negative beliefs and conduct caused the test failure. Self-fulfilling prophesies may be good if they lead to success. It's also crucial to remember that self-fulfilling prophesies are not the sole reason for test failure. Lack of information, poor test-taking tactics, or a bad day may also cause failure. To improve future chances, find the failure's reason.
