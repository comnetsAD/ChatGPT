If Bill's explanation for his driving test failure is correct, then the following must be true: Before taking the exam, Bill must have assumed he would do poorly. It's possible that this opinion was formed as a result of prior exposure, assumptions, or preconceived notions. Bill's conduct and attitude toward the exam likely suffered because of his expectation that he would do poorly on it. Perhaps he didn't study as hard as he should have, or he panicked or felt stressed out when taking the exam. It's likely that Bill's exam performance was affected by his attitude or conduct. It's possible, for instance, that his test scores suffered because he hadn't put in sufficient preparation time or because he was too distracted by his nerves. Undoubtedly, the poor performance on the exam was due to the candidate's pessimistic outlook and actions. It's important to remember that self-fulfilling prophesies aren't all doom and gloom, and may be good when a person's confidence in their own achievement motivates them to take the steps necessary to actually achieve that accomplishment. Self-fulfilling prophesies aren't the only thing to blame when things don't work out. In addition to not knowing what was expected of them, not having a good test-taking strategy, or simply having a terrible day may all play a role in a low performance on an exam. Finding the source of the failure and fixing it is crucial for moving forward.
