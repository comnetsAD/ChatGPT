Bill's theory that his driving test failure was the consequence of a self-fulfilling prophesy hinges on numerous factors being true. Before taking the exam, Bill must have assumed he would do poorly. It's possible that this opinion was formed as a result of prior exposure, assumptions, or preconceived notions. Bill's conduct and attitude toward the exam likely suffered because of his expectation that he would do poorly on it. Perhaps he didn't study as hard as he should have, or he panicked or felt stressed out when taking the exam. It's likely that Bill's exam performance was affected by his attitude or conduct. His performance might have been negatively impacted by factors such as his lack of preparation for the test or his inability to concentrate on the instructions because of test anxiety. Undoubtedly, the poor performance on the exam was due to the candidate's pessimistic outlook and actions. It's important to remember that self-fulfilling prophesies aren't all doom and gloom, and may be good when a person's confidence in their own achievement motivates them to take the steps necessary to actually achieve that accomplishment. Keep in mind that self-fulfilling prophesies aren't the only reason why an exam could be failed; other causes include ignorance, inadequate test-taking techniques, or even plain bad luck. Finding the source of the failure and fixing it is crucial for moving forward.
