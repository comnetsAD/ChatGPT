Bill must prove several things to claim that his driving test failure was a self-fulfilling prophecy: Bill must have expected to fail before taking the exam. Experiences, expectations, and preconceptions may have shaped this view. Bill's concern that he would fail must have influenced his test performance. He may have studied less or felt apprehensive throughout the examination. Bill's test performance was affected by his attitude. He may have performed poorly if he didn't practice enough or was too nervous to concentrate. Negative beliefs and conduct caused the test failure. Self-fulfilling prophesies may be good if they lead to success. Self-fulfilling prophesies aren't the sole cause of failure. Lack of information, lousy test-taking tactics, or a bad day may also cause test failure. To improve future chances, find the failure's reason.
