Your masculinity threat experiment may follow the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA). SUTVA is an experimental design assumption that one unit's treatment does not effect other units. In a masculinity threat experiment, this implies that individuals who were not manipulated should not be affected by the manipulation. Willer and colleagues' within-subjects design exposes each participant to both the masculinity threat manipulation and the control condition, indicating SUTVA. Researchers adjust for individual variations and infer causation by comparing participant responses in the two circumstances. Because the masculinity threat manipulation is only offered once to each participant, the experiment likely holds SUTVA. In conclusion, SUTVA holds in the masculinity threat experiment because the study's design allows for a within-subjects comparison of participants' answers in the two situations and does not alter the results of individuals who were not exposed to the manipulation.
