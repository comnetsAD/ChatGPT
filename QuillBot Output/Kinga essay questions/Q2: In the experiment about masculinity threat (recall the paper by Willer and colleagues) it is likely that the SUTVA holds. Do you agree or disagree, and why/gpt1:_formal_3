I am unaware of a particular study by Willer and colleagues describing a masculinity threat experiment where the SUTVA (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption) holds. The SUTVA is a causal inference assumption that asserts the prospective outcomes of an individual are unaffected by the treatment or treatments received by other persons. In other words, it implies that the acts or treatments administered to one individual do not alter the results for another. Without further information regarding the experiment you're referring to, it's impossible for me to agree or disagree with you. In general, however, it is conceivable for the SUTVA to hold in certain trials, especially if the research design and data analysis account for or control for potential inter-individual interactions. On the other hand, the SUTVA may not hold true in certain research owing to the complexity of the system being examined, which may result in spillover effect or network impact.
