Unfortunately, the SUTVA (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption) you describe does not seem to hold in any of the papers by Willer and colleagues that I am familiar with. An important assumption in causal inference is known as the SUTVA, which claims that an individual's results are independent of the treatments that any other persons may have received. In other words, it presumes that the activities and treatments of one individual do not alter the results for another individual. Without knowing more about the experiment in question, I can't say whether or not you're correct. However, the SUTVA could still hold in certain investigations, especially if the research plan and analysis take into consideration anticipated participant interactions. On the other hand, the SUTVA may not hold in certain investigations owing to the complexity of the system under investigation, which might result in a spillover impact or network effect.
