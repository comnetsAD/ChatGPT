The Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) is likely to hold in the experiment regarding masculinity threat that you are referring to. SUTVA is an experimental design assumption that says that the treatment provided to one unit has no effect on the results of other units. In the context of a masculinity threat experiment, this implies that manipulating the masculinity threat should have no effect on the results of individuals who were not exposed to the manipulation. Because the article by Willer and colleagues has a within-subjects design, each participant is exposed to both the masculinity threat manipulation and the control condition, it is likely to retain SUTVA. The researchers may account for individual variations and establish causation by comparing the participants' reactions in the two scenarios. Furthermore, the experiment is likely SUTVA since the manipulation of the masculinity threat is only shown to the participants once, which means that the result of one participant's experience with the manipulation should not be influenced by the experiences of other participants. In conclusion, I agree that SUTVA holds in the experiment about masculinity threat because the study is designed in such a way that the manipulation of masculinity threat should not affect the outcomes of participants who were not exposed to the manipulation, and the study design allows for a within-subjects comparison of the participants' responses in the two conditions.
