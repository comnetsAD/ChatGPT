The SUTVA (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption) is assumed to hold in the masculinity threat experiment, but I am not aware of any particular work by Willer and colleagues that makes this claim. The SUTVA is a causal inference assumption that claims that a person's possible outcomes are unaffected by the therapy or treatments that other people get. In other words, it is presumptive that the actions or treatments provided to one individual will not have an impact on the results for another. Without further details concerning the experiment you are referring to, it is challenging for me to concur with you or disagree with you. However, in general, the SUTVA may hold in certain trials, especially if the research design and data analysis are carried out in a manner that accounts for or controls for potential inter-individual interactions. On the other side, the complexity of the system under study in certain research may prevent the SUTVA from holding, which might result in spillover effect or network impact.
