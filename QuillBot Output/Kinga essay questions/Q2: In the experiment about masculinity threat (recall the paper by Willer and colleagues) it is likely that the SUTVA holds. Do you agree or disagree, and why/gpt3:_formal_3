It is probable that the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) holds true in the masculinity threat experiment you cite. SUTVA is an experimental design assumption that claims the treatment allocated to one unit does not influence the results of other units. In the context of an experiment on masculinity threat, this implies that the manipulation of masculinity threat should have no effect on the results of individuals who were not exposed to it. Due to the within-subjects design, each participant is exposed to both the masculinity threat manipulation and the control condition in the study by Willer and colleagues. By comparing the reactions of participants in the two settings, researchers may adjust for individual variations and infer causation. In addition, the experiment is likely SUTVA since the manipulation of masculinity threat is shown only once to each subject; hence, the result of one participant's experience with the manipulation should not be influenced by the experiences of other participants. In conclusion, I agree that SUTVA holds in the experiment about masculinity threat because the manipulation of masculinity threat should not affect the outcomes of participants who were not exposed to the manipulation, and the design of the experiment permits a comparison of the responses of participants in the two conditions.
