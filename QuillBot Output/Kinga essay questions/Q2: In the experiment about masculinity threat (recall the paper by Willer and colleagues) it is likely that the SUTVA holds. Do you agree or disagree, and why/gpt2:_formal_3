I am unaware of a Willer and colleagues research on masculinity threat and the SUTVA (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption) assumption. SUTVA is an assumption in causal inference which argues that the treatment status of others does not influence the prospective outcomes of a person. The assumption is crucial for assessing causal effects using observational data. In the context of an experiment on masculinity threat, this would indicate that the treatment status of other subjects does not influence the possible masculinity threat outcomes of the participants. Without knowing more about the study's design and procedures, it is impossible for me to conclude if SUTVA holds true in this particular experiment. Nonetheless, SUTVA is often an acceptable assumption to make when doing controlled research. Experiments that are well-designed and executed may give proof that SUTVA holds true. Importantly, SUTVA is not always satisfied in observational research, and when it is not satisfied, it might result in inaccurate estimates of causal effects. In such instances, alternate approaches, such as propensity score matching or instrumental factors, might be used to rectify the violation of SUTVA.
