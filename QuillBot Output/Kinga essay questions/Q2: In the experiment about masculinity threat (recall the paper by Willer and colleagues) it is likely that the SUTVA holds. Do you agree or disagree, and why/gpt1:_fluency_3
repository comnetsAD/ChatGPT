I am not aware of any particular work by Willer and colleagues describing a masculinity threat experiment in which the SUTVA (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption) holds, as you have indicated. The SUTVA is a causal inference assumption that claims that an individual's possible outcomes are unaffected by the treatment or treatments received by other persons. In other words, it presumes that the acts or treatments administered to one individual have no effect on the results for another. Without further information regarding the experiment you're referring to, it's impossible for me to agree or disagree with you. However, in general, the SUTVA may be used in certain research, especially if the study design and data analysis are done in a manner that controls for or compensates for potential inter-individual interactions. However, owing to the complexity of the system under study, the SUTVA may not hold in certain research, resulting in a spillover effect or network impact.
