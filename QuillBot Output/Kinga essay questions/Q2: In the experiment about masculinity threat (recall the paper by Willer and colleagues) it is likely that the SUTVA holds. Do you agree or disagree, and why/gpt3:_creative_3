To a high degree of probability, the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) holds in the study you cite on masculinity threat. That the treatment of one unit does not influence the results of other units (SUTVA) is a basic premise in experimental design. This indicates that the results of an experiment on masculinity threat should not be influenced by the exposure of the participants to the masculinity threat manipulation. The within-subjects design used by Willer et al. ensures that each participant experiences both the masculinity threat manipulation and the control condition, making the study very likely to hold SUTVA. Participants' answers in the two situations are compared to account for individual variations and draw causal conclusions. Since each person only encounters the masculinity threat manipulation once, the results of the experiment are unlikely to violate SUTVA because of the influence of other participants' exposure to the manipulation. In conclusion, I agree that SUTVA holds in the masculinity threat experiment because the manipulation of masculinity threat should not affect the outcomes of participants who were not exposed to the manipulation, and because the design of the study permits a within-subjects comparison of the responses of the participants in the two conditions.
