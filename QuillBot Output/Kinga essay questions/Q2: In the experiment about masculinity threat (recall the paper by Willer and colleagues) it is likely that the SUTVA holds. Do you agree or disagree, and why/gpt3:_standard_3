The Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) is likely true in the experiment you are referring to on the danger of masculinity. The SUTVA hypothesis, which governs experimental design, asserts that the treatment given to one unit has no effect on the results of any other units. This implies that the manipulation of the masculinity threat should not have an impact on the results of participants who were not exposed to the manipulation in the context of an experiment on the danger of masculinity. The within-subjects design of Willer and colleagues' article, in which each participant is exposed to both the masculinity threat manipulation and the control condition, suggests that it holds SUTVA. The researchers may account for individual variations and determine causation by comparing the participant's reactions in the two scenarios. Furthermore, the experiment is probably SUTVA since the individuals are only exposed to the danger of masculinity once, therefore the results of one participant's experience with the manipulation shouldn't be influenced by those of the other participants. In conclusion, I concur that SUTVA holds in the experiment on masculinity threat because the study's design ensures that the manipulation of masculinity threat shouldn't have an impact on participants' results who weren't exposed to the manipulation and because the study's design enables a comparison of participants' responses under the two conditions within-subjects.
