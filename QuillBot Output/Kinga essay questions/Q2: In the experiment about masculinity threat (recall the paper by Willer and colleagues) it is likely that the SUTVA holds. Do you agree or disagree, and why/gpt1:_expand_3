According to what you have said, I am not familiar with a particular publication written by Willer and colleagues concerning a masculinity threat experiment in which the SUTVA (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption) holds. The SUTVA is an assumption that is employed in causal inference, and it asserts that the prospective outcomes of a person are unaffected by the treatment or treatments that are received by other people. This assumption is known as the SUTVA. In other words, it presumes that the acts taken or treatments received by one individual do not effect or have any bearing on the consequences experienced by another person. Without further details regarding the experiment you are referring to, it is impossible for me to determine whether I agree or disagree with you. However, in general, it is conceivable for the SUTVA to hold in certain studies. This is especially true if the design of the research and the analysis of the data are carried out in a manner that adjusts for or accounts for the possibility of interactions between people. On the other hand, the SUTVA may not hold true in certain research owing to the complexity of the system that is being examined, which could result in a spillover effect or a network effect.
