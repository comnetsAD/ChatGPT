It is very possible that the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption, often known as SUTVA, was correct in the experiment that you are referring to about the masculinity threat. In experimental design, the SUTVA assumption asserts that the treatment applied to one unit does not influence the results obtained by any other units in the experiment. This implies that the manipulation of the masculinity threat should not alter the results of the participants in the experiment who were not exposed to the manipulation of the masculinity threat. This is because the experiment is about the masculinity threat. Because it is a within-subjects design, the research conducted by Willer and colleagues likely meets the criteria for SUTVA. This means that every participant in the study was subjected to both the masculinity threat manipulation and the control condition. The researchers are able to adjust for individual variations and infer causation via the process of comparing the replies of the participants under the two situations. The manipulation of masculinity threat is only shown to the participants once, which means that the outcome of one participant's experience with the manipulation should not be affected by the experiences of other participants because the manipulation is only shown to each participant once. This is another reason why the experiment most likely holds SUTVA. In conclusion, I concur with the finding that SUTVA is valid in the experiment regarding masculinity threat. This is due to the fact that the design of the study is such that the manipulation of masculinity threat should not affect the outcomes of participants who were not exposed to the manipulation, and the design of the study permits a within-subjects comparison of the responses that participants give in the two different conditions.
