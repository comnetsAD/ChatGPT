To my knowledge, Willer and colleagues have not conducted any research on masculinity threat where the SUTVA (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption) holds. This is a crucial premise for inferring causes from observed relationships. The prospective results of an experiment on masculinity threat would not be influenced by the treatment status of other individuals, if this were the case. Without knowing more about the experimental setup, I can't determine whether or not SUTVA holds in this particular experiment. However, SUTVA is often an acceptable assumption while doing studies in a lab or other controlled environment. Evidence for the validity of SUTVA may be gleaned through well-designed and -conducted experiments. Unfortunately, observational studies don't always adhere to SUTVA, which might provide skewed estimates of causal effects. When SUTVA is broken, we may utilize alternate approaches like propensity score matching or instrumental factors to fix the problem.
