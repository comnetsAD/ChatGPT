As you indicated, Willer and colleagues did not publish a masculinity threat experiment using the SUTVA (Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption). The SUTVA assumption in causal inference argues that an individual's prospective outcomes are unaffected by others' interventions. It presupposes that one person's results are unaffected by another's activities or treatment. I need additional information regarding the experiment to agree or disagree. However, the SUTVA may hold in certain trials, especially if the research design and data analysis allow for individual interactions. However, owing to system complexity, the SUTVA may not hold in other research, resulting in spillover impact or network effect.
