Willer and colleagues have not published a research on masculinity threat and SUTVA. Causal inference's SUTVA assumes that others' treatment status does not alter an individual's possible outcomes. For observational causal effect estimation, it is a key assumption. In a masculinity threat experiment, it means that other subjects' treatment status does not alter participants' masculinity threat results. SUTVA may not hold in this experiment without further information regarding the research design and techniques. In controlled trials, SUTVA is usually a realistic assumption. Well-designed experiments can prove SUTVA. SUTVA is not always satisfied in observational research, which might skew causal effect estimates. SUTVA violations may be corrected using propensity score matching or instrumental factors.
