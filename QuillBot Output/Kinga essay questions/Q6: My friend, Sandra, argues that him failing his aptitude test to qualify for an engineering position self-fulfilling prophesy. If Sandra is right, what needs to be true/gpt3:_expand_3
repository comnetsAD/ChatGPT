If Sandra is correct in her assertion that a poor performance on an aptitude test sets in motion a chain of events that inevitably leads to that failure, then the following must be true: Before he ever took the exam, Sandra must have had the expectation that he would do poorly on it. It's possible that prior experiences, preconceived notions, or prejudices led to the formation of this view. It is possible that Sandra's expectation that he would not pass the exam influenced either his actions or his mindset in relation to the test. One possibility is that he did not put as much effort into preparing for the test as he should have, or that he experienced anxiety or stress while taking the test. It is likely that his performance on the exam was influenced in some way by Sandra's actions or attitude about it. His performance may have been negatively impacted, for instance, because he did not adequately study for the exam or because he was too nervous to concentrate on the questions being asked. The unfavorable attitude and actions must have been the cause of the poor performance in the examination. It is important to keep in mind that self-fulfilling prophesies are not necessarily always negative but may also be good. This occurs when an individual's conviction that they will be successful leads to actions and behaviors that ultimately result in the individual's achievement of their goals. It is also essential to keep in mind that self-fulfilling prophesies are not the only factor that contributes to the failure of an endeavor. There are numerous other things that might have contributed to the low performance on the exam, such as a lack of prior knowledge, ineffective test-taking tactics, or even simply having a terrible day. It is essential to figure out what led to the failure in the first place and make an effort to fix the problem for better results in the future.
