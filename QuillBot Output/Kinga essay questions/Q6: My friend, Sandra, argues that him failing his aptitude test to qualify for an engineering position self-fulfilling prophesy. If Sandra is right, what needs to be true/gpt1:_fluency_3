If Sandra is accurate in claiming that her failure on an aptitude test for an engineering employment was a self-fulfilling prophesy, then the following must be true: Sandra had to have had low expectations of her own success on the exam at first. Sandra's low expectations may have affected her choices leading up to the exam, such as not studying as much or not seeking assistance. Sandra's low expectations and behaviors would have resulted in a poor test performance. Sandra's bad exam result would therefore corroborate her original low self-esteem. A self-fulfilling prophesy is a belief or anticipation that drives a person's conduct in such a manner that the belief or expectation manifests itself. In this situation, Sandra's fear of failing the aptitude exam would have caused her to under-prepare, resulting in a failure of the test. It is vital to highlight that self-fulfilling prophesies may be cyclical, which means that Sandra's failure on the aptitude exam might lead to low expectations for future tests or comparable scenarios, leading to failure again. Furthermore, self-fulfilling prophesies are neither predefined or unbreakable; they may be destroyed by altering one's mentality and conduct.
