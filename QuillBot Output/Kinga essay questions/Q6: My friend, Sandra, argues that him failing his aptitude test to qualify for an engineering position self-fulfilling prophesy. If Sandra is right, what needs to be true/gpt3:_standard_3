Several things must be true if Sandra is accurate that failing the aptitude exam is a self-fulfilling prophecy: Before he took the exam, Sandra must have thought he would fail. This opinion could have been shaped by prior encounters, assumptions, or preconceptions. He must have changed his conduct or attitude since Sandra thought he would fail the exam. For instance, he may not have studied as hard as he should have or could have experienced stress or anxiety while taking the test. The way Sandra conducted herself throughout the exam must have had an effect on his results. He may have performed worse if, for instance, he didn't study enough or was too excited to concentrate on the questions. The test must have failed as a consequence of the negative thinking and conduct. It's important to remember that self-fulfilling prophesies may be beneficial when someone believes they will achieve and takes actions and exhibits behaviors that support their accomplishment. It's crucial to remember that failure may occur for a variety of reasons beyond than self-fulfilling prophesies. Other variables that may have contributed to the test's failure include a lack of preparation, poor test-taking techniques, or even simply a bad day. To improve chances for success in the future, it's critical to pinpoint the failure's primary reason.
