If Sandra is correct and failing the aptitude exam is a self-fulfilling prophesy, then the following must be true: Sandra must have expected him to fail the exam before taking it. This belief might have been formed as a result of previous experiences, expectations, or preconceptions. Sandra's fear of failing the exam must have influenced his conduct or attitude toward the test. He may have put in less effort in preparing for the test, or he may have been apprehensive or agitated throughout the examination. Sandra's attitude or demeanor throughout the exam must have had an effect on his result. For example, if he did not prepare enough for the test or was too excited to concentrate on the questions, his performance may have suffered. The test must have failed due to the negative thinking and action. It's worth emphasizing that self-fulfilling prophesies aren't necessarily bad; they may also be positive, in which a confidence in one's ability to achieve leads to activities and behaviors that lead to success. It's also worth noting that self-fulfilling prophesies aren't the lone cause of failure. Many additional reasons, such as a lack of information, poor test-taking tactics, or simply a bad day, might have contributed to the test's failure. It is critical to understand the fundamental reason of the failure and attempt to rectify it in order to maximize future possibilities.
