Several conditions must hold true in order for Sandra's claim that poor performance on the aptitude exam will eventually come true: Sandra probably already knew in her head that he wouldn't pass the exam. It's possible that this opinion was formed as a result of prior exposure, assumptions, or preconceived notions. His performance or attitude on the exam likely suffered as a result of Sandra's expectation that he would do poorly. Perhaps he didn't study as hard as he should have, or he panicked or felt stressed out when taking the exam. What Sandra did or how she felt about the exam undoubtedly affected her husband's grade. Possible explanations include insufficient study time or test-day nerves that prevented him from concentrating on the questions. Undoubtedly, the poor performance on the exam was due to the candidate's pessimistic outlook and actions. It's important to remember that self-fulfilling prophesies aren't all doom and gloom, and may be good when a person's confidence in their own achievement motivates them to take the steps necessary to actually achieve that accomplishment. Self-fulfilling prophesies aren't the only thing to blame when things don't work out. Lack of preparation, incorrect test-taking tactics, or even simply having a terrible day may all play a role in a low performance on a standardized exam. Finding the source of the failure and fixing it is crucial for moving forward.
