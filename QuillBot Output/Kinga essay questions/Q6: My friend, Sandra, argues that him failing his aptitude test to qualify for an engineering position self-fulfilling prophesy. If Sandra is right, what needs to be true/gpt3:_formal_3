If Sandra's assertion that failing the aptitude exam is a self-fulfilling prophesy is accurate, then the following must be true: Sandra must have anticipated that he would fail the exam before he took it. This view may have been influenced by previous encounters, expectations, or preconceptions. Sandra's idea that he would fail the exam must have influenced his conduct or attitude toward the examination. For instance, he may have prepared for the exam with less effort or experienced anxiety or tension throughout the exam. Sandra's conduct or attitude toward the exam must have affected his performance. For instance, if he did not adequately study for the exam or was too nervous to concentrate on the questions, this may have hindered his performance. The failing of the examination must have stemmed from the negative beliefs and actions. Self-fulfilling prophesies are not necessarily bad; they may also be good, in which the idea that one will achieve leads to actions and behaviors that result in success. It is also essential to remember that self-fulfilling prophesies are not the sole cause of failure. Lack of information, ineffective test-taking tactics, or simply a lousy day may also have contributed to the failure of the exam. It is essential to discover the underlying reason of the failure and work to eliminate it for future success.
