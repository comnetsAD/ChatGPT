Sandra claims that she is a victim of a self-fulfilling prophesy because of her poor performance on an aptitude exam for an engineering employment. It's likely that Sandra went into the exam with low expectations for her own performance. Sandra would have prepared less for the exam or avoided getting assistance if she hadn't set high standards for herself. Sandra's low expectations and lackadaisical approach would have led to a poor performance. If Sandra did poorly on the exam, it would validate her negative self-perception. A self-fulfilling prophecy is an anticipation or belief that leads to action that brings about the fulfillment of that expectation or belief. In this situation, Sandra's fear of failing the aptitude exam would have prevented her from studying as diligently, ensuring that she did, in fact, do poorly. Sandra's failure on the aptitude exam may lead to low expectations for future tests or comparable scenarios, which may lead to more failure. Not only are self-fulfilling prophesies not fixed or unchangeable, but they are also susceptible to being shattered by a shift in perspective and action.
