Several factors would need to be true if Sandra is right when she claims that her inability to pass an aptitude test for an engineering employment is a self-fulfilling prophecy: Sandra must have had low expectations for her own success on the exam at first. Sandra's low expectations may have affected her test-day behavior, such as her decision to forgo extra study time or ask for assistance. Sandra would not have done well on the exam because of her low expectations and behavior. Sandra's subpar test results would later validate her original negative opinion of herself. A belief or anticipation that affects a person's conduct in such a manner that it makes the belief or expectation come true is known as a self-fulfilling prophecy. In this instance, Sandra would have underprepared since she thought she would fail the aptitude exam, which would have resulted in her failing the test. Because self-fulfilling prophesies may be circular, Sandra's failure on the aptitude test can cause her to have low hopes for subsequent exams or similar circumstances, which might then result in another failure. Also noteworthy is the fact that self-fulfilling prophesies may be avoided by altering one's attitude and conduct. They are neither predefined nor inevitable.
