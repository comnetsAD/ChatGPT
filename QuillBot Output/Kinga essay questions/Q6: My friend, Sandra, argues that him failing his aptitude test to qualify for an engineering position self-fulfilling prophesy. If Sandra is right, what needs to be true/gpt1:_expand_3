If Sandra's argument that her poor performance on an aptitude test for an engineering post is the result of a self-fulfilling prophesy is valid, then a number of circumstances would need to play out as follows: When Sandra first started thinking about how well she would do on the exam, she probably didn't have very high hopes for herself. Because Sandra did not have high expectations for herself going into the exam, she probably did not study as much as she should have or sought assistance when she needed it. Because Sandra didn't set high goals for herself and didn't put in the necessary effort, she didn't do very well on the exam. If Sandra continues to score poorly on the exam, it will just reaffirm the low expectations she had first set for herself. A thought or anticipation that impacts a person's conduct in such a manner that it causes the belief or expectation to come true is known as a self-fulfilling prophesy. Self-fulfilling prophecies may occur in both positive and negative contexts. In this particular scenario, Sandra's conviction that she would not pass the aptitude test would have caused her to under-prepare for the examination, which, in turn, would have caused her to not pass the examination. It is essential to keep in mind that self-fulfilling prophecies can have a cyclical nature. This means that Sandra's poor performance on the aptitude test could cause her to have low expectations for future tests or situations that are analogous to the one she did poorly on, which in turn could cause her to perform poorly on those future tests or situations. Furthermore, it is essential to keep in mind that self-fulfilling prophesies are not predefined or unavoidable; rather, they are susceptible to being debunked via a combination of mental and behavioral adjustments.
