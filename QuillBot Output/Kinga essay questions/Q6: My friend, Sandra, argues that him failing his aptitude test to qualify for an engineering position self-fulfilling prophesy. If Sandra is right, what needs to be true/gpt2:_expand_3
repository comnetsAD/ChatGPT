If Sandra is correct in her assertion that her performance on the aptitude exam was the result of a self-fulfilling prophesy, then a number of conditions must hold true. Before taking the exam, Sandra would have had unfavorable expectations about his capacity to do well on it. For instance, he could have been under the impression that he was unable to comprehend the subject matter or that he would not be able to perform successfully when the stakes were high. These unfavorable expectations would have had an effect on Sandra's conduct or attitude in such a manner that it would have hampered his performance on the exam. For instance, he may have had feelings of anxiety or lack of motivation, both of which may have interfered with his ability to concentrate or remember information. Because of Sandra's poor attitude and unfavorable expectations, the aptitude exam should have been failed by her. A self-fulfilling prophesy would have been created if Sandra had not done well on the exam since this would have caused her to have even lower expectations about herself. It is important to note that the self-fulfilling prophecy is a complex phenomenon, and it is possible that other factors, such as Sandra's lack of preparation, poor study habits, or difficulty with the specific material that was covered on the test, contributed to her poor performance on the test. It is also important to note that it is important to mention that the self-fulfilling prophecy is a complex phenomenon. In addition, it is possible to put an end to this occurrence by recasting the expectations and offering the appropriate assistance in order to get over the negative self-talk and improve performance.
