Sandra's claim that her engineering aptitude test failure is a self-fulfilling prophesy requires many conditions: Sandra must have had modest test performance expectations. Sandra's low expectations led to her not studying or seeking assistance before the exam. Sandra's low expectations and conduct would have hurt her test score. Sandra's bad exam result confirmed her low self-esteem. A self-fulfilling prophecy is a belief or anticipation that affects a person's conduct. In this scenario, Sandra's perception that she would fail the aptitude test caused her to underprepare, which caused her to fail. Self-fulfilling prophesies may be cyclical, therefore Sandra's aptitude test failure may lower her expectations for future exams or comparable scenarios, leading to failure again. Additionally, self-fulfilling prophesies may be broken by altering one's mentality and actions.
