If Sandra is correct, three things must be true. Before the exam, Sandra doubted his performance. He may have thought he couldn't comprehend or perform effectively under pressure. Sandra's test performance was hampered by these unfavorable assumptions. He may have been stressed or uninspired, affecting his focus or memory. Sandra would have failed the aptitude exam due to negative expectations and conduct. Sandra's test failure would have reinforced her poor self-image, producing a self-fulfilling prophesy. Self-fulfilling prophecy is complicated, and other reasons may have contributed to Sandra's low exam result, such as lack of preparation, bad study habits, or trouble with the test content. Reframing expectations and offering support may also help overcome negative self-talk and improve performance.
