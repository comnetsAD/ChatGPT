If Sandra's claim that her failure on an aptitude test for an engineering employment is a self-fulfilling prophesy is accurate, then four conditions must hold: Sandra must have originally had modest expectations for her success on the exam. Low expectations would have impacted Sandra's behavior leading up to the exam, such as not preparing as much or not seeking assistance. The low expectations and behaviors of Sandra would have caused her to do poorly on the exam. Sandra's bad result on the exam would reinforce her low self-esteem. A self-fulfilling prophesy is a belief or anticipation that drives an individual's conduct in such a manner that the belief or expectation comes to pass. In this instance, Sandra's expectation that she would fail the aptitude exam would have driven her to prepare less, which would have resulted in her failure. Self-fulfilling prophesies may be cyclical, meaning Sandra's failure on the aptitude exam might lead to low expectations for future tests or comparable scenarios, which can lead to failure again. Furthermore, it is essential to remember that self-fulfilling prophesies are not predefined or inevitable; they may be broken by modifying one's mentality and actions.
