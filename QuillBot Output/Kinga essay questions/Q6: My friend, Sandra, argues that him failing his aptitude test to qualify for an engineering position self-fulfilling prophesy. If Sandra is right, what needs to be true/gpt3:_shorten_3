Sandra's claim that failing the aptitude exam is a self-fulfilling prophesy implies multiple things: Before the exam, Sandra must have thought he would fail. Experiences, expectations, and preconceptions may have shaped this view. Sandra's expectation that he would fail must have influenced his test performance. He may have studied less or felt apprehensive throughout the examination. Sandra's test-taking conduct must have affected him. He may have done poorly if he didn't study enough or was too nervous to concentrate. Negative beliefs and conduct caused the test failure. Self-fulfilling prophesies may be good if they lead to success. Self-fulfilling prophesies aren't the sole cause of failure. Lack of information, lousy test-taking tactics, or a bad day may also cause test failure. To improve future chances, find the failure's reason.
