It is hard for me to predict precisely what social scientists would discover if they analyzed the suicide rate in 2050 and found that the female suicide rate is identical to the male suicide rate, and then altered the gender of the target in a small-world experiment. It is important to note, however, that suicide rates may be affected by a range of variables, including mental health, social support, access to options, and cultural views regarding suicide. Men have historically had greater suicide rates than women, but it is conceivable that changes in society, such as increasing awareness of mental health and more support for women, would result in a decrease of this discrepancy in the future. If social scientists altered the gender of the target in a small world experiment, it may show new patterns of social networks and dynamics that may contribute to suicide rates. However, it is essential to recognize that suicide is a multifaceted phenomena that is impacted by a variety of variables. Therefore, it is essential to research it using diverse methodologies and approaches.
