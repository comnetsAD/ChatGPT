I can't predict what social scientists would discover if they researched the suicide rate in 2050 and determined that the female suicide rate is the same as the male suicide rate, then altered the gender of the target in a small-world experiment. It is important to note, however, that suicide rates may be impacted by a number of variables, including mental health, social support, access to options, and cultural views regarding suicide. While there has historically been a gender disparity in suicide rates, with males having higher rates than women, it is conceivable that changes in society, such as improved mental health awareness and more support for women, might lead to a decrease in this gap in the future. If the social scientists changed the gender of the target in a small world experiment, it may show new patterns of social networks and dynamics that could contribute to suicide rates. It is crucial to remember, however, that suicide is a complicated phenomena that is impacted by a variety of variables. As a result, it is critical to investigate it using a variety of methodologies and approaches.
