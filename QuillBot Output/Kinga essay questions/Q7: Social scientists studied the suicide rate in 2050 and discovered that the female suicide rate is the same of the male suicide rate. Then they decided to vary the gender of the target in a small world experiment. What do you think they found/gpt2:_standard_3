The social scientists' tiny world experiment refers to a hypothetical investigation that occurs in the future, thus it is impossible for me to know precisely what they would have discovered there. According to the material given, the research seems to be looking at how gender roles and stereotypes may affect the propagation of suicidal ideas and actions through social networks. The researchers may have discovered that, while the overall suicide rate is the same for men and women, there are differences in how suicidal ideas and acts propagate in social networks for men and women. This may be due to gender-based preconceptions and expectations, such as the notion that males are more stoic and less prone to express their emotions than women, or that women are more emotional and more willing to discuss their difficulties. The research might potentially have shown that there is no discernible difference in how suicidal ideas and acts spread among men and women in the small world experiment, demonstrating that social networks are not influenced by gender norms and expectations in this respect. It is crucial to remember that suicide is a complicated problem that is affected by a number of variables, including mental health, social support, resource accessibility, and cultural attitudes. A small world experiment would be one of several research techniques used to comprehend the problem; any results would need to be validated via more study.
