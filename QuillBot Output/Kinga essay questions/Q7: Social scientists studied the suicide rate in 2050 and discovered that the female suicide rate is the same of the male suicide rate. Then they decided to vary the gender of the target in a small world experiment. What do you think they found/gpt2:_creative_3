Since this alludes to a hypothetical research in the future, I have no way of knowing for sure what the social scientists would have discovered in their tiny world experiment. The evidence presented suggests, however, that the research will investigate the role that gender stereotypes and norms play in the dissemination of suicide ideas and actions throughout social networks. One explanation is that the researchers saw a difference in the way suicidal ideas and actions propagate in male and female social networks despite the fact that the overall suicide rate is similar across the sexes. This may be due to gender-based preconceptions and assumptions, such as the notion that males are assumed to be more stoic and less prone to speak about their concerns, while women are presumed to be more emotional and more willing to talk about their difficulties. This research may have reached a different conclusion, finding that the small world experiment reveals no substantial difference in the spread of suicidal thoughts and actions among men and women. Noting that suicide is multifaceted and affected by things like mental health, social support, access to services, and cultural views is essential. Further study is needed to confirm any results from a small world experiment or any other research approach used to further understand the problem.
