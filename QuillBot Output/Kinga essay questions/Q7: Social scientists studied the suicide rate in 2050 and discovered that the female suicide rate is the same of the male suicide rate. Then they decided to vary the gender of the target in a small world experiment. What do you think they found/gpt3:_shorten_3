If social scientists analyzed the suicide rate in 2050 and found that the female suicide rate is the same as the male suicide rate, then altered the target gender in a small world experiment, it is difficult to predict what they would find. The experiment's outcomes rely on the population, methodologies, and cultural setting. Social scientists may uncover that gender influences suicide-related behavior propagated via social networks. The tiny world experiment examines social network information and behavior. Researchers might compare suicide-related behaviors in men and women by changing the target's gender. Suicide is complicated and impacted by mental health, social support, resources, and cultural beliefs. Thus, the experiment's findings may be complex and need additional study to understand the processes. Suicide research is delicate and might trigger some individuals, therefore it should be done with caution and the support of specialists.
