The gender of the target in a small-world experiment comparing the suicide rates of men and women in 2050 is something I cannot predict with any precision. Factors including mental health, social support, access to assistance, and cultural attitudes towards suicide may all play a role in determining suicide rates. Historically, males have had a greater suicide rate than women; however, improvements in society, such as improved awareness of mental health and more support for women, may eventually lead to a decrease of this discrepancy. It's possible that social scientists may learn more about the factors that contribute to suicide rates if they conducted a small world experiment in which the target gender was changed. Although many circumstances might play a role, it is essential to remember that suicide is a multifaceted phenomena. Therefore, it is essential to investigate it from a variety of angles.
