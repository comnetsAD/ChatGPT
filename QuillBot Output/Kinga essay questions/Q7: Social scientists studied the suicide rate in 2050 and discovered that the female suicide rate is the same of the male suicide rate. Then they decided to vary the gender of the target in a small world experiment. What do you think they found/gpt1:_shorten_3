I can't predict what social scientists would find if they investigated the suicide rate in 2050 and found that the female and male suicide rates are the same, then did a small-world experiment with different targets. However, mental health, social support, resources, and cultural attitudes about suicide might affect suicide rates. As society becomes more conscious of mental health and supports women, the gender difference in suicide rates may narrow. In a small world experiment, changing the target's gender might show social network and dynamics that may affect suicide rates. Suicide is complicated and impacted by many variables. Thus, it must be studied using several methodologies.
