The attitudinal fallacy is a cognitive bias in which individuals believe that other people share their attitudes and ideas. The idea that other people's opinions are plainly visible and can be deduced from their behaviors or acts. In their article "The Attitudinal Fallacy and the Ethnography of Infrastructure," Jerolmack and Khan warn us against the attitudinal fallacy by emphasizing that attitudes and beliefs are frequently shaped by the social and physical environments in which people live. They also point out that attitudes and beliefs are not always directly observable. They contend that it's crucial to comprehend how attitudes and opinions are created and how the social and physical contexts in which individuals live have an impact. Jerolmack and Khan warn us against believing that people's opinions about infrastructure, such as roads or bridges, can be deduced from their usage of these things in the context of their article. They contend that a range of elements, including people's social and economic backgrounds, cultural contexts, and the infrastructure itself, influence how people see it. Instead of believing that people's opinions can be gleaned straight from their behavior, it is crucial to understand how these elements combine to affect their attitudes regarding infrastructure. The assumption that one can deduce someone's attitude from their conduct or deed is known as the attitudinal fallacy. Jerolmack and Khan warn us against doing this by making the case that attitudes are complicated and influenced by a number of variables, including the social, economic, and cultural background, and can't be drawn straight from conduct.
