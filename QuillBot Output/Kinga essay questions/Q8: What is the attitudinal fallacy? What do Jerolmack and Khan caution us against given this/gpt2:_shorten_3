People think others share their opinions and attitudes due to the attitudinal fallacy. It's the idea that others' sentiments may be seen in their actions. In "The Attitudinal Fallacy and the Ethnography of Infrastructure," Jerolmack and Khan warn that attitudes and beliefs are not clearly observable and that people's attitudes and beliefs are frequently impacted by their social and material circumstances. They believe it's crucial to understand how people's attitudes and opinions are shaped by their social and material contexts. In their research, Jerolmack and Khan warn against inferring people's sentiments regarding infrastructure like highways and bridges from their usage of them. They contend that social, economic, cultural, and infrastructural elements impact people's opinions regarding infrastructure. Thus, rather than believing that people's infrastructure views can be derived from their behavior, it is vital to understand how these aspects interact. The attitudinal fallacy holds that one may deduce someone's attitude from their actions. Jerolmack and Khan warn us that views are complicated and formed by social, economic, and cultural environment, so they can't be deduced from conduct.
