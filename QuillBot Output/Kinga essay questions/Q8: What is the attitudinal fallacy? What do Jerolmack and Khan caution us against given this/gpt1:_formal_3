Sociologists use the term attitudinal fallacy to explain the propensity to infer people's attitudes or views from their conduct or behaviors. The idea is that people's actions are a reflection of their beliefs and emotions. In their article "The Attitudinal Fallacy and the Study of Culture," Jerolmack and Khan warn sociologists against the attitudinal fallacy and suggest that people's conduct is not always an accurate sign of their underlying attitudes or beliefs. They contend that people's behaviors are formed by a complex interaction of social norms, expectations, and restrictions, and that these elements may impact conduct regardless of people's opinions or beliefs. Inferring people's opinions or beliefs from their conduct might thus result in a misunderstanding of the causes that influence their behaviors. Instead of inferring attitudes or views from action, the authors urge that sociologists should concentrate on comprehending the social and cultural environment in which behavior happens. In addition, they recommend that sociologists keep in mind the complexity of social activity and the many elements that might impact conduct, such as social norms, expectations, and restrictions. In conclusion, the attitudinal fallacy is the notion that people's conduct reflects their attitudes or views. Jerolmack and Khan advise sociologists against this assumption and urge them to concentrate on comprehending the social and cultural environment in which behavior happens.
