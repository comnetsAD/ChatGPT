The propensity to infer people's attitudes or views from their conduct or behaviors is known as the attitudinal fallacy in the discipline of sociology. The underlying premise is that people's actions reflect their beliefs and/or emotions. In their article "The Attitudinal Fallacy and the Study of Culture," Jerolmack and Khan warn sociologists against the attitudinal fallacy and make the case that people's actions are often not a reliable indication of their underlying attitudes or beliefs. They contend that social norms, expectations, and restrictions play a complicated role in determining how individuals behave and that these elements may have an impact on people's conduct regardless of their opinions or beliefs. Consequently, extrapolating someone's views or beliefs based on their conduct might result in a misinterpretation of the forces that motivate them. The authors argue that rather than inferring attitudes or views from action, sociologists should concentrate on comprehending the social and cultural environment in which behavior happens. Additionally, they advise sociologists to be aware of the complexity of social activity and the many variables that might affect conduct, such as social norms, expectations, and limitations. The assumption that people's actions are a reflection of their attitudes or beliefs is known as the "attitudinal fallacy," and Jerolmack and Khan advise sociologists to avoid making this assumption and instead concentrate on figuring out the social and cultural contexts in which behavior takes place.
