The sociological concept of "attitudinal fallacy" refers to the common practice of reading others' thoughts and feelings into their actions. It's the idea that people's actions reveal their innermost thoughts and emotions. In their article "The Attitudinal Fallacy and the Study of Culture," authors Jerolmack and Khan warn sociologists against making the mistake of assuming that people's actions reveal their true attitudes and beliefs. People's behaviors, they say, are formed by a web of social norms, expectations, and restrictions that operate independently of individual views and values. Therefore, it might be misleading to assume anything about a person's ideas or views based on their behaviors. It is argued in these works that sociologists, rather than inferring attitudes or views from action, should seek to understand the social and cultural setting in which behavior happens. Furthermore, they advise sociologists to keep in mind the multifaceted nature of social action and the variety of circumstances, such as social norms, expectations, and restrictions, that might affect individuals' actions. In sum, Jerolmack and Khan warn sociologists against making the attitudinal fallacy's erroneous assumption that people's actions are indicative of their attitudes or beliefs. Instead, they advise that researchers instead pay close attention to the larger social and cultural contexts in which actions take place.
