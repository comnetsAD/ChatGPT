The attitudinal fallacy is a cognitive bias in which individuals believe that others share their attitudes and ideas. It is the assumption that other people's sentiments can be immediately seen and deduced from their behaviors or actions. Jerolmack and Khan warn us against the attitudinal fallacy in their article "The Attitudinal Fallacy and the Ethnography of Infrastructure," stating that attitudes and beliefs are not directly observable, and that people's attitudes and beliefs are frequently shaped by the social and material environments in which they live. They say that it is critical to understand how people's attitudes and ideas are formed, as well as how they are shaped by their social and material circumstances. In their study, Jerolmack and Khan warn against believing that people's sentiments regarding infrastructure, such as highways or bridges, can be deduced from their usage of these things. People's perceptions regarding infrastructure, they claim, are impacted by a range of elements, including their social and economic background, cultural environment, and the infrastructure itself. As a result, rather than thinking that people's opinions can be drawn straight from their conduct, it is critical to understand how these elements combine to affect people's attitudes regarding infrastructure. In essence, the attitudinal fallacy is the notion that one can deduce another person's attitude from their conduct or deed. Jerolmack and Khan warn against this, claiming that views are complicated and influenced by a range of elements such as social, economic, and cultural environment, and hence cannot be drawn straight from action.
