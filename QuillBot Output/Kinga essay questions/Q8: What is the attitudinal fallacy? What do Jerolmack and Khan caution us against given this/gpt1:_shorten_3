Sociology calls this tendency the attitudinal fallacy. People's actions reflect their beliefs and feelings. In "The Attitudinal Fallacy and the Study of Culture," Jerolmack and Khan warn sociologists that people's conduct doesn't always reflect their ideas. They contend that a complex interaction of social norms, expectations, and restraints shapes people's conduct regardless of their opinions or beliefs. Thus, inferring people's opinions or ideas from their conduct might misinterpret their motivations. Sociologists should study the social and cultural background of conduct rather than inferring views or opinions from it, the authors say. They also advise sociologists to consider the complexity of social activity and the various elements that might impact conduct, including social norms, expectations, and limits. In short, the attitudinal fallacy is the notion that people's conduct reflects their attitudes or views. Jerolmack and Khan advise sociologists to concentrate on the social and cultural context of behavior.
