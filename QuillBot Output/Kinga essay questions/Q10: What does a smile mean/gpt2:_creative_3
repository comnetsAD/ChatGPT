A smile is a common kind of facial expression that conveys joy, satisfaction, or mirth. Combinations of activities, such as tightening the muscles surrounding the eyes and mouth, are usually required to get the desired look of slightly curled lips. The muscles surrounding the eyes contract during a real Duchenne grin, whereas the muscles around the lips contract during a phony non-Duchenne smile. To communicate friendliness, openness, or interest in interacting with people, a smile may also function as a social signal. As a social regulation tool, smiling may be used to express agreement or de-escalate tense situations. It's important to remember that a grin may not always be a sign of happiness, and that its meaning might differ from culture to culture and from person to person. Sometimes, people put on a happy face to fool others or to gain control of a situation. Therefore, the significance of a grin may be altered depending on the circumstances and the nature of the interpersonal interaction between the people involved.
