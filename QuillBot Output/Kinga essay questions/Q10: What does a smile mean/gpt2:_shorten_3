Smiles show enjoyment, pleasure, or amusement. The lips are curled by contracting the muscles surrounding the eyes and mouth. The Duchenne smile, which contracts the muscles surrounding the eyes, is a real grin, whereas the non-Duchenne smile, which contracts just the lip muscles, is a phony smile. Smiling shows friendliness, openness, and sociability. Smiling may also be used to convey agreement or defuse a tense situation. A smile's meaning may vary among cultures and people, and it doesn't necessarily indicate happiness. A grin may disguise bad feelings or influence people. Thus, a smile's meaning depends on the situation and connection of the parties.
