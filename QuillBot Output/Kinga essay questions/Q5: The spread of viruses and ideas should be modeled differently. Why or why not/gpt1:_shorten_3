Because viruses and thoughts are separate phenomena with different processes, they may be described differently. Physical interactions between people and viruses facilitate viral propagation. The number of susceptible people, the number of infected people, the rate of transmission from infected to susceptible, and the efficacy of vaccinations and quarantine measures all affect the spread of a virus. Compartmental models can monitor the movement of people between susceptible, infected, and recovered groups to represent viral propagation. However, social and cultural relationships and communication promote the dissemination of ideas. The amount of people exposed to a concept, its perceived significance and legitimacy, the social networks of individuals, and the resistance or acceptance of the thought by individuals and organizations all affect its spread. The Bass model shows how a population adopts an invention over time. In conclusion, although both viruses and ideas may be mathematically described, the processes that drive their spread are distinct and need separate models to adequately portray the intricacy of the process.
