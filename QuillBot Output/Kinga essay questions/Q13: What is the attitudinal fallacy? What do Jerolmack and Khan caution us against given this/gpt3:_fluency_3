The attitudinal fallacy is the assumption that the language used to describe a subject might reveal a speaker's attitude or sentiments about it. Jerolmack and Khan warn against presuming that a speaker's choice of certain language or terms represents their own opinions or attitudes about the issue at hand, since language is often employed in complicated and nuanced ways that cannot be simply reduced to simple assertions of attitude or belief. They believe that instead, we should concentrate on understanding the social and cultural circumstances in which language is employed, as well as the manner in which language is utilized to accomplish certain communication purposes.
