The assumption that one's own personal sentiments or attitudes towards a subject may be used as evidence for or against an argument or assertion is an example of the fallacy known as the attitudinal fallacy. In other words, it is the notion that just because someone feels passionately about something, it must be true or incorrect, regardless of whether or not the person really knows the answer. When assessing the validity of an argument or claim, Jerolmack and Khan warn us not to commit the attitudinal fallacy by stressing how important it is to keep one's subjective beliefs or prejudices apart from the objective facts. They contend that focusing on one's own sentiments or views might result in faulty reasoning and an absence of critical thinking since it is based on the individual. Instead, they argue for evaluating the validity of an argument or claim based on the evidence and the reasoning that follows logically from it.
