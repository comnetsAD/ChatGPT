The attitudinal fallacy is the idea that one's own sentiments or attitudes towards a subject may be used to support or refute a claim or an argument. In other words, it is the notion that something must be true or incorrect if someone feels passionately about it. Jerolmack and Khan warn us against the attitudinal fallacy by highlighting the significance of separating subjective beliefs from factual facts when assessing a claim or argument. They contend that depending too much on one's own emotions or views might result in erroneous conclusions and a lack of critical thinking. Instead, they promote the use of facts and sound logic to assess the viability of a claim or argument.
