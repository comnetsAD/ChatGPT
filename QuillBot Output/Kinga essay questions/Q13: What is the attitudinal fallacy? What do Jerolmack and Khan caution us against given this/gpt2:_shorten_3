The attitudinal fallacy is the idea that one's own views or attitudes towards an issue may support or disprove a thesis. Thus, it is the belief that something is true or incorrect because someone firmly believes it. Jerolmack and Khan warn against the attitudinal fallacy by highlighting the need to separate personal biases from objective facts when assessing an argument or claim. They suggest that personal sentiments and attitudes may contribute to faulty reasoning and a lack of critical thinking. Instead, they utilize facts and logic to assess an argument or assertion.
