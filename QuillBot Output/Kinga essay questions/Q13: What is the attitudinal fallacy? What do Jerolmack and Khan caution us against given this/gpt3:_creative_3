The attitudinal fallacy is when someone assumes that another person's perspective on a subject can be gleaned from the words they use to express it. Because language is frequently used in complex and nuanced ways that cannot easily be reduced to simple expressions of attitude or belief, Jerolmack and Khan warn against assuming that a speaker's use of particular language or words necessarily reflects their personal beliefs or attitudes about the topic at hand. In their place, they say that we should consider how language is used to serve certain communication ends, as well as the social and cultural settings in which it is utilized.
