The attitudinal fallacy is the mistaken notion that a speaker's attitude or thoughts toward a subject may be derived from the words they use to express it. This is an example of a kind of linguistic fallacy known as a linguistic attribution error. Because language is frequently used in complex and nuanced ways that cannot easily be reduced to simple expressions of attitude or belief, Jerolmack and Khan warn against assuming that a speaker's use of certain language or words necessarily reflects their personal beliefs or attitudes about the subject at hand. They believe that we should instead concentrate on gaining an awareness of the social and cultural settings in which language is employed, as well as paying attention to the ways in which language is utilized to accomplish certain communicative purposes.
