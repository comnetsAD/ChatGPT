The attitudinal fallacy is the notion that one's own views or attitudes towards a subject may be used as evidence for or against an argument or assertion. In other words, it is the belief that something must be true or incorrect if someone feels passionately about it. When examining an argument or assertion, Jerolmack and Khan warn against the attitudinal fallacy by highlighting the need to separate personal ideas or prejudices from objective data. They contend that focusing on personal sentiments or attitudes might result in faulty reasoning and a lack of critical thought. In lieu of this, they propose using facts and logical reasoning to assess the validity of an argument or claim.
