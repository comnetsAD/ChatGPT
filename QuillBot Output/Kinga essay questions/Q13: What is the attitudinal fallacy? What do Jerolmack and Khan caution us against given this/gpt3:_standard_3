The assumption that one may deduce a speaker's attitude or sentiments about a subject from the words they choose to express it is known as the attitudinal fallacy. Jerolmack and Khan warn against making assumptions that a speaker's use of particular language or words necessarily reflects their personal beliefs or attitudes about the subject at hand. This is because language is frequently used in complex and nuanced ways that cannot be simply reduced to expressions of attitude or belief. Instead, they contend, we should put our emphasis on comprehending the social and cultural contexts in which language is utilized as well as how it is employed to accomplish certain communication objectives.
