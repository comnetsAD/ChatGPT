The attitudinal fallacy holds that a speaker's sentiments about an issue may be deduced from their words. Jerolmack and Khan warn against thinking that a speaker's choice of specific language or terms necessarily represents their own opinions or attitudes about the matter at hand, since language is frequently complicated and nuanced. Instead, they suggest studying language's social and cultural surroundings and how it's employed to attain certain communication aims.
