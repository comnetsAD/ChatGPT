The attitudinal fallacy is the mistaken notion that one's subjective evaluation of an issue may support or refute a proposition. The belief that a proposition is true or incorrect only because of the intensity of an individual's emotional attachment to it. Jerolmack and Khan warn against the attitudinal fallacy by stressing the need to evaluate an argument or claim based only on its merits, rather than allowing one's own ideas or prejudices to cloud one's judgment. In their view, focusing on one's own emotions or biases is a certain way to end up with illogical conclusions and an absence of critical thinking. Rather, they stress the need of considering facts and sound reasoning when deciding whether or not to accept a claim.
