The assumption that one's own personal sentiments or attitudes toward a subject may be used as evidence for or against an argument or assertion is known as the attitudinal fallacy. In other words, it is the belief that if someone has strong feelings about something, it must be true or incorrect. When examining an argument or assertion, Jerolmack and Khan warn us against the attitudinal fallacy by highlighting the need of separating personal ideas or prejudices from objective data. They contend that focusing on personal sentiments or attitudes might result in faulty reasoning and a lack of critical thinking. Instead, they argue for evaluating the merits of an argument or claim using facts and logical reasoning.
