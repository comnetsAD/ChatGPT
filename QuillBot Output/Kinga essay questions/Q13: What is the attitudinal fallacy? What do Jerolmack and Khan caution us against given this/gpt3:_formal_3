The attitudinal fallacy is the notion that a speaker's attitude or sentiments may be derived from the words they choose to discuss a subject. As language is frequently used in complex and nuanced ways that cannot be easily reduced to simple expressions of attitude or belief, Jerolmack and Khan caution against assuming that a speaker's use of particular language or words reflects their personal beliefs or attitudes regarding the topic at hand. Instead, they suggest that we should concentrate on understanding the social and cultural contexts in which language is employed and on how language is utilized to accomplish certain communication purposes.
