Shodan may be used to find and exploit weaknesses in critical infrastructure systems, which is why it is restricted. Because it may be used to perform cyber assaults on power grids, water treatment facilities, and other important infrastructure, this presents a huge security concern. Reason 2: Shodan may also be used to collect sensitive personal information such as IP addresses, login passwords, and other private information. This has the potential to lead to identity theft and other nefarious behaviors. Allow Reason: Shodan may be used legitimately for cybersecurity research and vulnerability evaluations. It may assist in identifying and patching vulnerabilities in systems, so making them more secure. Policy: Except for approved cybersecurity researchers and vulnerability assessors, all people and organizations are prohibited from using Shodan-like technologies. These approved persons and organizations must obtain formal approval from the right authorities and adhere to rigorous data use, management, and reporting rules. Any unlawful use of Shodan-like technologies will result in legal action being taken immediately.
