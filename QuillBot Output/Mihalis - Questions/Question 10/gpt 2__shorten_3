Data breaches and cyberattacks: Data breaches and cyberattacks are one of the main reasons to limit Shodan and related programs. Malicious actors may use these technologies to find network vulnerabilities and exploit them for profit or data theft. Compliance with laws: Another reason to limit Shodan and related technologies is to comply with rules like the GDPR or HIPAA (HIPAA). These tools breach these standards by collecting, storing, and exploiting personal data without permission. Cybersecurity pros benefit: However, cybersecurity pros may profit from Shodan and comparable technologies. These technologies may help firms prevent cyberattacks by identifying network weaknesses and monitoring for threats. Our staff and contractors cannot utilize Shodan or comparable technologies. Without authorization, these technologies cannot gather, store, or utilize personal data. Only approved cybersecurity specialists may use these tools to find vulnerabilities and monitor our company for threats. Unauthorized use of Shodan or similar technologies may lead to contract or job termination.
