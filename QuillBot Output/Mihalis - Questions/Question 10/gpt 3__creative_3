The first valid justification for limiting access to Shodan is that it may be used to search for and exploit security flaws in systems vital to society. There is a serious security issue since this might be used in cyber assaults on infrastructure as diverse as power grids and water purification facilities. The second justification for limiting access to Shodan is that it may be used to steal confidential information. There's a risk of identity theft and other bad things happening as a result of this. Shodan may be used to do valid research and vulnerability evaluations in the field of cybersecurity, hence its usage is justified. It may help find security flaws in a system and fix them so that the system is more secure. As a matter of policy, only approved cybersecurity researchers and vulnerability assessors are permitted to utilize technologies similar to Shodan. A documented authorization from the proper authorities and agreement to stringent criteria for data use, processing, and reporting are prerequisites for these approved persons and organizations. If you use a Shodan-like tool without permission, you will be taken to court right away.
