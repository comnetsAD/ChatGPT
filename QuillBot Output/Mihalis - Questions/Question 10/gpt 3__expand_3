Shodan is capable of locating and exploiting weaknesses in critical infrastructure systems. This is the first reason why Shodan cannot be utilized. Since of this, there is a serious danger to national security because it is possible to launch cyber assaults on vital infrastructure such as electricity grids, water treatment facilities, and other essential systems using it. Shodan may also be used to collect sensitive personal information, such as IP addresses and login passwords, in addition to other private data, which is why it is subject to this restriction. This may put victims at risk for identity theft and other forms of criminal activity. Shodan may be used for legitimate purposes, such as doing research on cybersecurity or conducting vulnerability assessments. It is possible to find vulnerabilities in systems and apply patches to them, which will make the systems more secure. Policy dictates that the use of Shodan and other tools similar to it is prohibited for all companies and people, with the exception of approved cybersecurity researchers and vulnerability assessors. These approved persons and organizations are required to acquire formal approval from the relevant authorities and must agree to adhere to stringent criteria about the use of the data, its management, and the reporting of it. Any attempt to utilize Shodan-like tools without authorization will result in immediate legal action being taken.
