The request for the website's content is normally sent by the host via the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (HTTP Secure) protocol. The request is then sent to the server hosting the website, which processes the request and obtains the material from its database that corresponds to the request. The host receives a response from the server that contains the material that was requested. This response may comprise HTML, CSS, JavaScript, or picture files. The answer is received by the host, and the information included inside the response is used by the host in order to display the contents of the website on the web browser utilized by the client. The host will continue to send out requests and get replies from the client as the customer interacts with the website in various ways, for as by clicking on links or filling out forms. In a nutshell, the client is able to access the contents of the website by initiating a request for information from the website's server and then getting that information using the HTTP or HTTPS protocol. The information included in the answer is used by the host in the process of displaying the contents of the website on the web browser utilized by the customer.
