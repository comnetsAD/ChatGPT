The host commonly uses the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (HTTP Secure) protocol to submit a request for the website's contents. The website's server receives the request, processes it, and obtains the needed material from its database. The requested material, such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and pictures, are included in the server's response, which is sent to the host. The host receives the reply, and makes use of the data inside to show the contents of the website on the client's web browser. As the client uses the website, such as by clicking links or completing forms, the host continues to send and receive requests and answers. In conclusion, the act of requesting and receiving information from the website's server via the HTTP or HTTPS protocol allows the website's contents to reach the client. The contents of the website are displayed on the client's web browser by the host using the data in the response.
