As a means of requesting the desired page or resource, the host computer uses the hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP). When a user makes a request of a website, the server responds with an HTTP response that includes the requested data. IP packets carrying the requested web page or resource are then delivered back to the host. When an IP packet is received, the host reconstructs it into the data that was requested. The contents of the page or resource are shown on the client device by the host. The host employs the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) for this action. Port 80 is used for non-encrypted HTTP traffic, whereas port 443 is used for encrypted HTTP traffic. In conclusion, the client is able to access the website's content via making use of the HTTP protocol to make the request for and to receive the requested page or resource. IP packets representing the requested site or resource are transmitted back to the host, where they are decoded and rendered on the client device.
