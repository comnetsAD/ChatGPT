Once the host creates a connection with the website, the website's contents reach the client via the following stages. The host makes a request to the website using the transport-layer protocol (such as TCP or UDP) and the corresponding port number, requesting the desired web page or resource. The request is received and processed by the website, which retrieves the requested web page or resource from its server. The website provides the requested web page or resource, together with any related data or media, as a response to the host. The host gets the answer, analyzes the web page's content, and transmits it to the client device. The host sends a request to the website using the transport-layer protocol and the correct port number, the website sends a response containing the requested web page or resource, and the host receives and processes the web page's contents, displaying it on the client device.
