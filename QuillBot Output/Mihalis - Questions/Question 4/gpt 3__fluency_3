The host makes a request for the website's contents, generally over the HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) or HTTPS (HTTP Secure) protocol. The request is sent to the server of the website, which processes it and obtains the requested material from its database. The server responds to the host with the requested content, which may contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and pictures. The host receives the response and utilizes the information in it to display the website's contents on the client's web browser. As the client interacts with the website, such as by clicking on links or completing forms, the host continues to send and receive requests and answers. In summary, the contents of the website reach the client through the HTTP or HTTPS protocol, which is used to request and receive information from the website's server. The information in the response is used by the host to display the contents of the website on the client's web browser.
