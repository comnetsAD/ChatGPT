The following stages describe how the website's contents finally reach the client when the host establishes a connection with it: The host requests the exact web page or resource it wishes to access from the website using the transport-layer protocol (such as TCP or UDP) and the relevant port number. The requested web page or resource is fetched from the server when the website receives and executes the request. The website replies to the host with a response that includes the requested web page or resource and any additional data or media. After processing the contents of the web page after receiving the answer, the host displays them on the client device. In summary, the host sends a request to the website using the transport-layer protocol and the correct port number, the website responds with the requested web page or resource, and the host receives and processes the response before displaying the contents of the web page on the client device.
