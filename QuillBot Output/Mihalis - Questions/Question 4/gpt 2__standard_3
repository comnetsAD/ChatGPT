The host requests a certain webpage or resource from the website via an HTTP request. Following receipt of the request, the website transmits an HTTP response containing the requested webpage or resource. The requested website or resource is included in the IP packets that are returned to the host as the response. The host receives the IP packets and puts the requested site or resource together from them. On the client device, the host shows the website or resource's content. The host communicates with the website via the HTTP protocol throughout this process. Ports 80 and 443 are used by the HTTP protocol respectively for encrypted and unencrypted communication. In conclusion, the HTTP protocol, which is used to request and receive the webpage or resource, is how the contents of the website reach the client. The host receives the requested website or resource as IP packets, which are then combined and shown on the client device.
