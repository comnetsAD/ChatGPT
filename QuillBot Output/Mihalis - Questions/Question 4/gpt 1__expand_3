Following the establishment of a connection between the host and the website "," the client will finally get the contents of the website as a result of the following steps: The host then makes a request to the website in which it asks for the particular web page or resource that it wishes to view. The request is sent using the transport-layer protocol (such as TCP or UDP) and the relevant port number. The request is then processed by the website, which ultimately results in the website retrieving the requested web page or resource from its server. The requested web page or resource, as well as any data or media that is linked with it, is included in the response that is sent from the website to the host. The answer is then received by the host, which then processes the contents of the web page to prepare it for display on the client device. After the host sends a request to the website using the transport-layer protocol and the appropriate port number, the website sends a response containing the requested web page or resource, and the host receives and processes the contents of the web page, displaying it on the client device. This is the general process that allows the client to access the information on the website.
