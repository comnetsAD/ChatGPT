The web server receives an HTTP request from the host, which asks for a certain webpage or resource to be provided. After the website has received the request, it will then transmit an HTTP response that includes the webpage or resource that was requested. The website or resource that was requested is included in the response that is delivered back to the host computer in the form of IP packets. The host is the entity that is responsible for receiving the IP packets and reassembling them into the resource or website that is being requested. On the client device, the host will show the contents of the website or resource that they are serving. During this particular procedure, the host will connect with the website by making use of the HTTP protocol. The HTTP protocol use port number 80 for communication that is not encrypted, whereas port number 443 is used for communication that is encrypted. In conclusion, the client is able to access the information contained on the website thanks to the use of the HTTP protocol. This is the same protocol that is used to make the request for the webpage or resource and to afterwards receive it. The host receives the requested web page or resource as IP packets, which are then reassembled and shown on the client device. The IP packets are transmitted back to the host.
