The host makes an HTTP request to the website, requesting the requested webpage or resource. After receiving the request, the website delivers an HTTP response containing the requested webpage or resource. The host receives the answer in the form of IP packets carrying the requested website or resource. The IP packets are received by the host and reassembled into the requested website or resource. On the client device, the host shows the contents of the website or resource. During this action, the host communicates with the website over the HTTP protocol. The HTTP protocol communicates using port 80 for unencrypted transmission and port 443 for encrypted communication. In summary, the website's contents are sent to the client through the HTTP protocol, which is used to request and receive the webpage or resource. The requested website or resource is returned to the host as IP packets, which are then reassembled and displayed on the client device.
