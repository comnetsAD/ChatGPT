When a host first connects to a website, the following sequence of events occurs before the website's content is finally sent to the client: The host computer initiates contact with the server by sending a request for the requested page or resource using the transport layer protocol (TCP or UDP) and port number. As soon as the request is received, the website processes it, ultimately retrieving the requested page or resource from its server. The requested web page or resource, together with any accompanying data or media, is sent by the website as part of a response to the host. After the host gets the response, it will analyze the data contained within it and render the page for display on the client device. In conclusion, the client sees the website's contents because the host sent a request to the website through the transport-layer protocol and the correct port number, the website sent a response containing the requested web page or resource, and the host received and processed the answer.
