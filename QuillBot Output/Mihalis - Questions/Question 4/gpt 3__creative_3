The host makes a request for the website's data, generally over the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or the more secure HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure). The request is then processed by the website's server, which accesses the database to get the desired information. The server returns the requested data to the host, which may contain HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and pictures. The host receives the answer and utilizes the data contained therein to render the website to the client's browser. As the user engages with the host's website, sending requests and receiving replies, the host's end is always active. In a nutshell, the client accesses the website's content by making a request to, and then getting a response from, the website's server using the HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP) or the Secure HTTP (HTTPS). The data in the response is what the host employs to render the webpage in the user's browser.
