The router uses its routing table to determine the next hop for the request and forwards it to the next network device (such as a switch or another router) or directly to the Internet.  The router uses its routing table to determine the next hop for the request and forwards it to the next network device (such as a switch or another router) or directly to the Internet.  The router uses its routing table to determine the next hop for the request and forwards it to the next network device (such as a switch or another router) or directly to the Internet.  The following processes occur when the host establishes a connection with the website: The host requests the host name's IP address from 8.8.8.8, the DNS IP address. The host connects to the website by using the DNS server's IP address. The host asks the router for its MAC address, "135.168.1.1." The router delivers its MAC address in an ARP reply, enabling the host to connect. The host sends the router a packet with the website's IP address. The router sends the IP packet to the website using the target IP address. These port numbers are used: The host sends and receives DNS requests on port 53. Port 0 is the host's ARP request and response port. TCP or UDP is used to connect the host to the website. Protocol determines ports numbers. For HTTP and HTTPS, the host utilizes port 80 and 443, respectively. The host, router, and DNS server carry the communication request from the client to the server. The host utilizes port 53 for DNS, port 0 for ARP, and the transport-layer protocol to connect to the website. The server and transport-layer protocol will interact through the correct port number.
