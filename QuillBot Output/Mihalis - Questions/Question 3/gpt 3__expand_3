When a connection is first established between the host and the website, the following sequence of events occurs as the communication request makes its way from the client (the host) to the server (the website): The host initiates a DNS query to the IP address of 8.8.8.8 that is assigned to the DNS server, inquiring for the IP address that is linked to the host name "." The host utilizes the IP address that is associated with the host name to begin a connection with the website. The IP address is returned by the DNS server when the host name is queried. An ARP request is sent from the host to the router, in which the host asks for the MAC address that is connected to the IP address "135.168.1.1" of the router. It is now possible for the host to establish a connection with the router once it has sent an ARP reply including its MAC address. The host then transmits an IP packet to the router, which contains the destination IP address of the website in quotation marks. The IP packet is sent to the specified website by the router, which is determined by the destination IP address. The following port numbers are used when carrying out this operation: Both the DNS request and the DNS answer are sent and received on port number 53 on the host. Both the ARP request and the ARP response are sent and received over port number 0 on the host. The connection between the host and the website is established by the use of a transport-layer protocol, such as TCP or UDP. The protocol that is utilized will determine the numbers that correspond to the ports. For instance, if the host employs the HTTP(S) protocol, it will utilize port 80 for HTTP communication and port 443 for HTTP communication. In conclusion, the communication request makes its way from the client to the server by way of the host computer, the network, and the DNS server. The connection between the host and the website is established through the transport-layer protocol, using port number 53 for the DNS request and response, port number 0 for the ARP request and response, and port number 53 for the DNS request. In order to interact with the server, the transport-layer protocol will determine the proper port number and utilize it.
