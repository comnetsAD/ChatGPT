When the host begins a connection with the website, the communication request goes as follows from the client (host) to the server (website): The host transmits a DNS query to the DNS IP address of 8.8.8.8, requesting the IP address corresponding to the host name. The DNS server delivers the IP address associated with the host name, which is used by the host to establish a connection to the website. The host makes an ARP request to the router, requesting the MAC address corresponding to the router's IP address "135.168.1.1." The router responds with its MAC address in an ARP reply, enabling the host to establish a connection with it. The host transmits an IP packet to the router carrying the IP address of the target website. The router sends the IP packet to the website depending on the IP address of the destination. During this procedure, these port numbers are utilized: The host utilizes port 53 for DNS requests and responses. The host's ARP request and ARP response utilize port number 0. To establish a connection with the website, the host use a transport-layer protocol, such as TCP or UDP. The port numbers will be determined by the employed protocol. If the host utilizes the HTTP(S) protocol, for instance, it will use port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS. The communication request is sent from the client to the server through the host, the router, and the DNS server. To create a connection with the website, the host utilizes port 53 for the DNS request and response, port 0 for the ARP request and answer, and the transport-layer protocol. The transport-layer protocol will interact with the server using the proper port number.
