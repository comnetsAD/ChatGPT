The communication request moves from the client (host) to the server (website) in the following phases when the host first establishes a connection with it: The host requests the IP address for the host name "" by sending a DNS request to the DNS IP address of 8.8.8.8. The host utilizes the IP address that the DNS server provides in order to establish a connection with the website. The host queries the router through an ARP request for the MAC address related to its "135.168.1.1" IP address. The host may connect to the router by sending an ARP reply to it with its MAC address. The host transmits an IP packet to the router that contains the website's destination IP address. Based on the target IP address, the router sends the IP packet to the website. The following ports are used throughout this process: For DNS requests and responses, the host utilizes port 53. For both the ARP request and ARP response, the host uses port number 0. The host connects to the website using a transport-layer protocol, such as TCP or UDP. The protocol being used will determine the ports' numbers. For instance, the host will utilize port 80 for HTTP and port 443 for HTTPS if the HTTP(S) protocol is used. In conclusion, the host, router, and DNS server all play a role in the communication request's journey from the client to the server. The host connects to the website using the transport-layer protocol, port number 0 for ARP requests and responses, port number 53 for DNS requests and responses, and port 53 for DNS responses. The proper port number will be used by the transport-layer protocol to connect to the server.
