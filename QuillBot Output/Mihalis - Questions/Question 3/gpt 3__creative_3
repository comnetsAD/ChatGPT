When a host first connects to a website, the host's request to communicate with the website goes through the following stages: To get the IP address corresponding to the host name "," the host issues a DNS query to the DNS IP address of 8.8.8.8. When a host requests an IP address from a DNS server, the host receives the IP address associated with the host name. The host initiates an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) query to the router, specifying the IP address of the router (in this case, 135.168.1.1) and requesting the MAC address that corresponds to it. To help the host connect to the router, it will respond to the ARP request with the router's own MAC address. To access a website, a host will send an IP packet to a router with the address of the server as the packet's destination. Based on the IP address included inside the IP packet, the router will send the data on to the requested website. Here are some of the port numbers that will be utilized throughout this process: DNS requests and responses are handled by the host over port 53. The host sends and receives ARP requests and responses over port 0. A connection between the host and the website is established using a transport-layer protocol, such as TCP or UDP. The protocol being utilized will determine the port numbers that are available. If the host supports the HTTP(S) protocol, for instance, it will utilize ports 80 and 443 for the respective protocols. From client to server, a communication request goes through host, router, and domain name server. The host initiates a connection with the web server through port 53 (used for DNS queries and replies), port 0 (used for ARP queries and replies), and port 443 (used for the transport layer protocol). The correct port number will be used for server communication via the transport layer protocol.
