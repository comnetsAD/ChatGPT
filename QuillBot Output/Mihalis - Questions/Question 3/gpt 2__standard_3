The router uses its routing table to determine the next hop for the request and forwards it to the next network device (such as a switch or another router) or directly to the Internet.  When the host connects to the website, the following processes occur: The host makes a DNS request to 8.8.8.8 for the host name's IP address. The host uses the DNS server's IP address to connect to the website. The host requests the router's "135.168.1.1" MAC address through ARP. The host connects to the router through an ARP reply using its MAC address. The host delivers the website's IP address to the router in an IP packet. Based on the website's IP address, the router sends the IP packet. Port numbers utilized during this operation: The host utilizes port 53 for DNS requests and responses. The host uses port 0 for ARP requests and responses. The host connects to the webpage via TCP or UDP. Port numbers depend on the protocol. For HTTP and HTTPS, the host will utilize port 80 and 443, respectively. In summary, the host, router, and DNS server route the client's communication request to the server. The host utilizes port 53 for DNS requests and responses, port 0 for ARP requests and responses, and the transport-layer protocol to connect to the website. The server's port number will be used by the transport-layer protocol.
