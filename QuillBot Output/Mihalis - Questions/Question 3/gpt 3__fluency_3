When the host begins a connection with the website "," the communication request goes in the following phases from the client (host) to the server (website): The host makes a DNS request to 8.8.8.8's DNS IP address, requesting the IP address associated with the host name "." The DNS server delivers the IP address that corresponds to the host name, which the host uses to connect to the website. The host makes an ARP request to the router, requesting the MAC address linked with the IP address "135.168.1.1" of the router. The router responds with an ARP response with its MAC address, enabling the host to connect to it. The host sends an IP packet to the router with the website's target IP address "." Based on the target IP address, the router sends the IP packet to the website. The following port numbers are utilized during this operation: For DNS requests and responses, the host utilizes port 53. For the ARP request and response, the host uses port number 0. To connect to the website, the host employs a transport-layer protocol such as TCP or UDP. The protocol that is utilized will determine the port numbers. For example, if the host employs the HTTP(S) protocol, port 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS will be used. To summarize, the communication request is routed from the client to the server through the host, router, and DNS server. To connect to the website, the host utilizes port 53 for DNS requests and responses, port 0 for ARP requests and responses, and the transport-layer protocol. To interact with the server, the transport-layer protocol will utilize the proper port number.
