The router uses its routing table to determine the next hop for the request and forwards it to the next network device (such as a switch or another router) or directly to the Internet.

The router uses its routing table to determine the next hop for the request and forwards it to the next network device (such as a switch or another router) or directly to the Internet.  When the host connects to the website, the communication request goes from the client (host) to the server (website) through the following steps: The host queries 8.8.8.8 for the IP address associated with "." The DNS server provides the IP address associated with the host name, which the host uses to connect to the website. The host makes an ARP request to the router for the MAC address associated with the router's IP address "135.168.1.1." The router's ARP reply containing its MAC address lets the host connect to it. The router receives an IP packet with the website's IP address from the host. Based on the IP address, the router sends the IP packet to the website. This operation uses the following port numbers: DNS requests and responses utilize port 53 on the host. ARP requests and responses utilize port 0 on the host. To connect to the website, the host utilizes a transport-layer protocol like TCP or UDP. The protocol will set port numbers. The host utilizes port 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS if it employs HTTP(S) protocol. The client's communication request passes via the host, router, and DNS server to reach the server. The host connects to the website using the transport-layer protocol, port 53 for DNS requests and responses, and port 0 for ARP requests and responses. The server will interact with the transport-layer protocol through the correct port.
