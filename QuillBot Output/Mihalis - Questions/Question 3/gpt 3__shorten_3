The following stages occur when the host connects to the website: The host queries 8.8.8.8 for the IP address of "." The host connects to the website using the DNS server's IP address. The host requests the router's MAC address, "135.168.1.1," through ARP. ARP replies containing the router's MAC address enable the host to connect. The router receives an IP packet from the host with the website's IP address. The router sends IP packets to websites depending on their IP addresses. This operation uses these port numbers: DNS requests and responses utilize port 53. ARP requests and responses utilize port 0. TCP or UDP connects the host to the website. Protocol determines port numbers. HTTP(S) hosts utilize port 80 for HTTP and 443 for HTTPS. The host, router, and DNS server transport the communication request from client to server. The host connects to the website using port 53 for DNS, port 0 for ARP, and the transport-layer protocol. The transport-layer protocol will connect to the server through the right port.
