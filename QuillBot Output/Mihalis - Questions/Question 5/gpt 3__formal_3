Cyberthreats are continually developing, but malware, phishing, ransomware, and distributed denial of service (DDoS) assaults are prevalent forms of threats. Malware refers to malicious software that may infect a computer or device, giving an attacker access to sensitive data or disrupting operations. Phishing refers to efforts to get personal information, such as passwords and credit card details, from people through a bogus email or website. Ransomware is a form of virus that encrypts the data of a victim and demands money in return for the decryption key. DDoS attacks impair service by flooding a website or network with traffic. Using cyberattacks instead of physical assaults is often motivated by the opportunity to conduct an attack remotely and with a lesser danger of getting discovered. Cyberattacks may be less costly and have a bigger potential impact than physical attacks. In addition, more firms and people keep sensitive data online, which makes it a more desirable target for hackers. In addition, it is a technique for hackers to disrupt the services of a firm or government without physically being there.
