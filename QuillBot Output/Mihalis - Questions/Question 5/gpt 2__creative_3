The nature of cyber threats changes over time and may be classified in several ways. Malware, software with malicious intentions, is one of the most widespread forms of cyber-threats. Viruses, worms, and trojans are all examples of malware that may infect a system and propagate from there to do harm or steal data. Phishing is another popular sort of cyber-threat, and it is used to try to get users to provide sensitive information or login credentials. Ransomware, a kind of malware that encrypts a victim's data and asks for a fee to decrypt them, is another sort of cyber-threat. Other forms of cyber-threats include advanced persistent threats (APTs), which are generally used by state-sponsored actors or criminal organizations to obtain persistent access to a target's network and steal critical data over an extended period of time. Depending on their objectives, cyberattackers may choose to launch digital assaults instead of traditional ones. There is a possibility that attackers are seeking financial benefit, either by obtaining valuable information that may be resold on the dark web or by demanding ransom payments. Other people may be trying to steal secret government documents or disrupt essential services because they are ideologically or politically motivated to do so. In addition to stealing sensitive information, cybercriminals may launch assaults on businesses in an effort to disrupt operations or tarnish their brand. Attackers may conduct cyber-attacks from any location, giving them an attractive low-risk, high-reward strategy.
