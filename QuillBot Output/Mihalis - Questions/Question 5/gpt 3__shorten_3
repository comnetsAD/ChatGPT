Malware, phishing, ransomware, and DDoS assaults are typical cyberthreats. Malware may infect a computer or device and enable an attacker to steal data or disrupt operations. Phishing is using bogus email or websites to get sensitive information like passwords or credit card details. Ransomware encrypts data and demands money to unlock them. DDoS attacks flood a website or network with traffic. Cyberattacks are widely used because they may be launched remotely and without being discovered. Cyberattacks are cheaper and more damaging than physical attacks. Cybercriminals target numerous companies and people because they keep valuable data online. Hackers may potentially use it to disrupt commercial or government functions remotely.
