Cyberthreats are developing and may be categorized. Malware is one of the most frequent cyberthreats. Viruses, worms, and trojans may infect a system and steal data. Phishing is another prevalent cyberthreat used to steal personal information or login credentials. Ransomware encrypts data and demands a ransom to decrypt them. State-sponsored actors or criminal organizations utilize advanced persistent threats (APTs) to steal sensitive data from a target's network. The attacker's aims may motivate cyber-attacks instead of physical assaults. Some attackers take important data to sell on the black market or demand a ransom. Political or ideological motives may drive others to destroy essential infrastructure or steal government or military secrets. Cyberattacks may also harm a company's reputation or operations. Cyberattacks are low-risk, high-reward since they may be launched from anywhere.
