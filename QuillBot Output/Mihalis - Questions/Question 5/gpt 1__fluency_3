Organizations and people may be subjected to a wide range of cyber risks. Some examples of frequent kinds are: Malware, often known as viruses, trojans, and ransomware, is software that is meant to damage or exploit a computer system. Phishing is a social engineering technique that is used to deceive individuals into disclosing sensitive information such as login passwords or financial information. DDoS attacks are attempts to render a website or network resource inaccessible by flooding it with traffic from many sources. APTs are long-term and targeted cyber attacks in which an attacker creates an illegal, long-term presence on a network in order to steal sensitive data. The objectives for cyber assaults vary, although they often involve financial gain, espionage, or political motivations. A cyber thief, for example, may employ malware to steal credit card information for financial gain, while a nation-state actor would utilize APT methods for espionage. Furthermore, physical assaults may be dangerous and difficult to carry out, but cyber attacks can be launched from anywhere in the globe, making it a popular option for people or organizations wishing to disrupt or steal important information.
