The panorama of cyberthreats is continually changing and may be divided into various subcategories. Malware, which is software intended to damage or exploit a computer or network, is one of the most prevalent sorts of cyber-threats. This may include malware like as viruses, worms, and trojans that can harm a system or steal sensitive data by infecting it and spreading across it. Phishing, a technique intended to deceive people into supplying personal information or login credentials, is another typical sort of cyber-threat. Ransomware is a sort of virus that encrypts a victim's data and requests a ransom payment in order to decrypt them. This is another category of cyber-threats. Another sort of cyber-threat is known as advanced persistent threats (APTs), which are generally employed by state-sponsored actors or criminal organizations to enter a target's network over an extended period of time and steal important data. Using cyberattacks rather of physical ones might be motivated for a variety of reasons, depending on the attacker's objectives. Some attackers could be driven by the desire for financial gain, for example, by stealing confidential information that can be sold on the black market or by demanding a ransom. Others can be driven by political or ideological objectives, such as seeking to damage vital infrastructure or steal confidential military or government data. Cyberattacks may be used to harm a company's reputation or to stop commercial activities. Cyberattacks are also easy to initiate from any location in the globe, making them a low-risk, high-reward strategy for attackers.
