Malware, phishing, ransomware, and distributed denial of service (DDoS) assaults are some of the most frequent forms of threats in the cyber-threat environment. Malware is a kind of malicious software that may infect a computer or device and enable an attacker to access sensitive data or disrupt operations. Phishing is an effort to deceive someone into supplying personal information, such as passwords or credit card details, through a bogus email or website. Ransomware is a sort of virus that encrypts a victim's data and then demands payment for the decryption key. DDoS attacks include flooding a website or network with traffic in order to interrupt service. The capacity to carry out an assault remotely and with a lesser danger of being detected is generally the rationale for choosing cyber-attacks instead of physical attacks. Cyber-attacks may potentially be less expensive and have a bigger impact than physical ones. Furthermore, many firms and people have vital information electronically stored, making it a more appealing target for hackers. It is also a method for hackers to disrupt a company's or government's services without having a physical presence in the region.
