Malware, phishing, ransomware, and distributed denial of service (DDoS) assaults are some examples of popular cyberthreats, while the environment is always changing. Malware is the term for malicious software that may infect a computer or other device and provide an attacker access to private data or cause disruptions. Phishing is the practice of deceiving someone into divulging private information, including passwords or credit card details, through a bogus email or website. A kind of malware known as ransomware encrypts a victim's data and demands money in return for the decryption key. DDoS attacks include saturating a network or website with traffic in order to interfere with service. The ability to conduct an assault remotely and with a reduced danger of being detected is often the driving force behind choosing cyberattacks over physical attacks. Compared to physical assaults, cyberattacks have a higher potential impact and might be more cost-effective. Furthermore, a lot of businesses and people keep critical information online, which makes it a more appealing target for hackers. Additionally, it gives hackers a method to interfere with government or commercial operations without being there physically.
