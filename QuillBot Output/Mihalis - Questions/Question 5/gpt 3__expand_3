Malware, phishing, ransomware, and distributed denial of service (DDoS) assaults are some of the most prominent forms of cyber threats, but the threat environment is always shifting and growing. Malware is a kind of harmful software that may infect a computer or other electronic device and provide an adversary access to private data or the ability to impede normal business operations. Phishing is the practice of attempting to get sensitive information from someone, such as passwords or credit card details, by deceiving them into believing they are receiving an email or visiting a website that is fraudulent. Ransomware is a sort of malicious software that encrypts the data of its victim and then demands money in order to get the key necessary to decode the contents. DDoS attacks consist of flooding a website or network with an excessive amount of traffic in an effort to disrupt service. Many times, the capacity to carry out an assault remotely and with a lesser chance of being detected is the driving force behind the decision to use cyber-attacks rather than traditional physical attacks. Attacking a computer network may be less expensive overall and have a larger potential for damage than attacking a physical location. In addition, a large number of corporations and private people save significant information in electronic storage, which makes this information a more desirable target for cybercriminals. In addition to this, it is also a method for hackers to interfere with the operations of a business or government without needing to be physically present at the target place.
