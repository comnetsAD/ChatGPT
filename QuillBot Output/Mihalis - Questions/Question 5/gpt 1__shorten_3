Organizations and people confront several cyberthreats. Common types: Malware: viruses, trojans, and ransomware. Phishing: social engineering to get login credentials or financial information. Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks: flooding a website or network resource with traffic. Advanced persistent threats (APTs): an attacker illegally stays on a network to steal sensitive data. Financial gain, espionage, or politics frequently motivate cyber assaults. A nation-state actor may utilize APT methods for espionage, whereas a cyber criminal may use malware to steal credit card information for financial gain. Physical assaults are dangerous and difficult to perform, but cyber attacks can be conducted from anywhere in the globe, making them a favorite option for disruptors and data thieves.
