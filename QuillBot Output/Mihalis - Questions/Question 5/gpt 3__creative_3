Malware, phishing, ransomware, and distributed denial of service (DDoS) assaults are all examples of frequent cyber dangers. The term "malware" is used to describe any kind of program designed specifically to do harm to a computer or other electronic device. Phishing is the practice of sending emails or creating websites that seem legitimate in order to fool users into divulging personal information. Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts a user's data and then demands money in return for the decryption key. Overloading a server or network with traffic is one method of launching a distributed denial of service attack. The ability to launch an assault from a distance and without raising suspicion is a major draw for those who might otherwise resort to physical violence but instead resort to cyberattacks. The cost of a cyberattack may be lower than the cost of a similar physical assault, and the latter may not even come close to matching the former's potential damage. And because so much sensitive information is now housed digitally, both businesses and people are prime targets for hackers. It's also a technique for hackers to disrupt a company's or government's services remotely.
