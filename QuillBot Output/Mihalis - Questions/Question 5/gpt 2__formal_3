The cyber-threat environment is ever-changing and may be divided into a number of categories. Malware, which is software intended to damage or exploit a computer or network, is one of the most widespread sorts of cyber-threats. This may include viruses, worms, and trojans, which can infect and propagate across a system, inflicting harm or stealing sensitive data. Phishing is a prevalent cyberthreat that is used to fool users into divulging their personal information or login credentials. Cyberthreats also include ransomware, a sort of virus that encrypts a victim's data and demands a price to recover access. Advanced persistent threats (APTs) are another sort of cyber-threat, generally used by state-sponsored actors or criminal organizations to acquire long-term access to a target's network and steal important information. Depending on the attacker's objectives, the motive for using cyberattacks instead of physical ones might differ. Some attackers may be motivated by financial gain, such as by stealing valuable information to sell on the black market or by demanding a ransom payment. Others may be motivated by political or ideological objectives, including as disrupting vital infrastructure or stealing key government or military secrets. Cyberattacks may also be used to disrupt corporate operations and harm the reputation of a corporation. In addition, attackers may conduct cyberattacks from anywhere in the globe, making them a low-risk, high-reward alternative.
