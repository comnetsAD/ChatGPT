MAC addresses, also known as Media Access Control addresses, are unique identifiers issued to each network device. They are used to identify devices on the OSI model's data connection layer (layer 2). MAC addresses are employed throughout the communication process when the host (with the MAC address 8a:00:12:3e:d6:be) makes a connection with the router (default gateway), which has a different MAC address. The host makes an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) request to the router, requesting the MAC address of the router. The router then replies with its MAC address, which the host uses to connect to the router. After connecting the host to the router, the router utilizes the host's MAC address to forward data packets to the host. The MAC address of the host is also used by the router to keep track of the host's position on the network and to guarantee that data packets are only transmitted to the proper device. As a result, MAC addresses are used at the start of the communication process to connect to the router, and then throughout the communication process to forward data packets and maintain track of the host's position on the network.
