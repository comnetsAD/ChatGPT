MAC (Media Access Control) addresses are unique physical addresses allocated to network devices, such as the 8a:00:12:3e:d6:be host device in this instance. They are used to identify and address local area network devices (LAN). MAC addresses are used throughout the communication process when the host device makes a request to the router (default gateway) to create a connection with a website. In order to create a connection, the host device makes an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) request to the router in order to obtain its MAC address. The host device must identify the router in order to establish a connection. This ARP request is broadcast to all LAN devices, and the router answers with its MAC address, enabling the host device to establish a connection and submit the DNS request. MAC addresses are used to identify and address devices on a local area network. Prior to establishing a connection, the host device makes an ARP request to the router in order to discover its MAC address.
