MAC addresses (Media Access Control) are unique physical addresses issued to network devices, such as the host device in this example, which has a MAC address of 8a:00:12:3e:d6:be. They are used to identify and address local area network devices (LAN). MAC addresses are utilized during the communication process when the host device makes a request to the router (default gateway) to create a connection with the website. The host device makes an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) request to the router to discover its MAC address, since identifying the router is required for the host device to establish a connection. This ARP request is broadcast to all LAN devices, and the router answers with its MAC address, enabling the host device to connect and submit the DNS request. MAC addresses, in brief, are unique physical addresses allocated to network devices that are used to identify and address devices on a local area network. They are utilized in the communication process when the host device makes an ARP request to the router to ascertain its MAC address before connecting.
