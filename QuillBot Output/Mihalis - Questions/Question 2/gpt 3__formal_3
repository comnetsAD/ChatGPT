MAC (Media Access Control) addresses are unique physical addresses issued to network devices, such as "8a:00:12:3e:d6:be" for the host's MAC address in this instance. They are used to identify and address local area network devices (LAN). MAC addresses are used throughout the communication process when a host establishes a connection with the router (default gateway) in order to access a website. The host makes an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) request to the router, requesting the MAC address corresponding to the router's IP address "135.168.1.1." The router then transmits an ARP response including its MAC address, enabling the host to establish a connection with it. MAC addresses are unique physical addresses issued to network devices and used to identify and address devices on a local area network (LAN). During the communication process, when the host starts a connection with the router via the ARP protocol, they are used.
