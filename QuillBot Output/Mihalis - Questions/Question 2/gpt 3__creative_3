In this case, the host's MAC address is "8a:00:12:3e:d6:be," which is a MAC address, or Media Access Control address. On a local area network, they serve as a means of addressing and identifying individual devices (LAN). When a host makes a connection to a router (the default gateway) to access a website, MAC addresses are utilized as part of the communication process. The host sends a Request for Address Resolution (ARP) to the router, specifying the IP address of the router (in this case, 135.168.1.1), and inquiring as to what MAC address is linked with that IP address. The host then receives the router's MAC address in an ARP reply sent by the router. In conclusion, Media Access Control (MAC) addresses are unique physical addresses allocated to network devices that are used to identify and address devices on a local area network (LAN). Through the ARP protocol, they are used when the host first makes contact with the router.
