The "8a:00:12:3e:d6:be" MAC address that was issued to the host in this situation is an example of a unique physical address that is assigned to network devices and is known as a "Media Access Control" address. On a local area network, they are used for the purpose of identifying and addressing the various devices (LAN). In the course of the communication process, MAC addresses are used whenever the host makes first contact with the router (the default gateway) in order to get access to the website. The host initiates an Address Resolution Protocol, or ARP, request to the router, asking for the media access control (MAC) address that corresponds to the IP address of the router, which is "135.168.1.1." Following this, the router will transmit an ARP reply including its MAC address. This will enable the host to successfully establish a connection with the router. In a nutshell, media access control (MAC) addresses are exclusive physical addresses that are issued to network devices. These addresses are used to identify and address devices on a local area network (LAN). They play a role in the process of communication, namely during the phase in which the ARP protocol is utilized to establish a connection between the host and the router.
