Media Access Control addresses (or MAC addresses) are the special numbers given to every gadget on a network. They are assigned unique identifiers on the OSI model's data connection layer (layer 2). MAC addresses are used in the communication process when, for example, a host with MAC address 8a:00:12:3e:d6:be establishes a link with a router (default gateway) with a different MAC address. To discover the router's MAC address, the host initiates an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) request. The host then makes use of the router's MAC address to connect to the router. As soon as the host is connected to the router, the router will utilize the host's MAC address to send data packets to the host. The router utilizes the host's MAC address to determine the right destination for data packets and to maintain track of the host's position on the network. The MAC address is used to establish a connection with the router at the start of a communication session and to forward data packets and monitor the host's position on the network afterwards.
