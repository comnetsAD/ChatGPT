The host device in this case has a MAC address of 8a:00:12:3e:d6:be, which is a unique physical address in a network. On a local area network, they serve as a means of addressing and identifying individual devices (LAN). The media access control (MAC) address is utilized when the host device makes a connection request to the router (default gateway). In order to establish a connection, the host device must first identify the router, thus it sends an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) request to the router to find out its MAC address. In response to this ARP request, the router broadcasts its MAC address to all devices on the LAN, enabling the host device to make contact and submit the DNS query. In conclusion, Media Access Control (MAC) addresses are unique physical addresses allocated to network devices that are used to identify and address devices on a local area network. When a host device wants to know the router's MAC address before establishing a connection, it makes an ARP request.
