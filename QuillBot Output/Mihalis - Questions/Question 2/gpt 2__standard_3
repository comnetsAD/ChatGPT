Network devices are given physical addresses known as MAC (Media Access Control) addresses, such as the host device in this example, which has the MAC address 8a:00:12:3e:d6:be. They are used for local area network device identification and addressing (LAN). When the host device makes a request to the router (default gateway) to create a connection with the website, MAC addresses are utilized throughout the communication process. In order to establish a connection, the host device must recognize the router, thus it sends an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) request to find out the router's MAC address. The router replies with its MAC address to the ARP request broadcast to all LAN devices, enabling the host device to connect and submit the DNS request. In conclusion, local area network (LAN) devices are identified and addressed using their unique physical addresses, or MAC addresses, which are allocated to network devices. They are utilized in the course of a conversation when the host device asks the router for its MAC address in order to create a connection.
