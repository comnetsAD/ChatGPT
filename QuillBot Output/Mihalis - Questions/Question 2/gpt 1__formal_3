They are used to identify devices on the OSI model's data connection layer (layer 2). MAC addresses are utilized throughout the communication process when the host (with MAC address 8a:00:12:3e:d6:be) makes a connection with the router (default gateway), which has a different MAC address. The host sends an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) request to the router, requesting its MAC address. The host then establishes a connection with the router using the router's MAC address. Additionally, the router utilizes the host's MAC address to keep track of the host's position on the network and to guarantee that data packets are only transmitted to the intended device.
