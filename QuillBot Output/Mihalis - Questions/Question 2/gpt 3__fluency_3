MAC addresses (Media Access Control) are unique physical addresses issued to network devices, such as the host's MAC address "8a:00:12:3e:d6:be" in this example. They are used to identify and address local area network devices (LAN). MAC addresses are utilized throughout the communication process to visit the website when the host begins a connection with the router (default gateway). The host requests the MAC address associated with the router's IP address "135.168.1.1" using ARP (Address Resolution Protocol). The router then sends an ARP response containing its MAC address, enabling the host to connect to it. MAC addresses, in brief, are unique physical addresses allocated to network devices that are used to identify and address devices on a LAN. They are utilized in the communication process when the host establishes a connection with the router via the ARP protocol.
