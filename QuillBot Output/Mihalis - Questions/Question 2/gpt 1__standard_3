Each device on a network is given a unique identification code known as a MAC address, or Media Access Control address. They are used to identify hardware on the OSI model's second tier, the data connection layer. When the host, which has the MAC address 8a:00:12:3e:d6:be, attempts to connect to the router (the default gateway), which has a different MAC address, MAC addresses are utilized throughout the communication process. The host requests the router's MAC address through an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) request. The host utilizes the router's MAC address, which it receives as a response from the router, to connect to it. The router uses the host's MAC address to forward the data packets to the host after it has established a connection with it. In order to make sure that data packets are only routed to the right device, the router additionally utilizes the host's MAC address to keep track of the host's position on the network. Therefore, MAC addresses are used throughout the communication process to forward data packets and maintain track of the host's position on the network, as well as at the beginning of the communication process to establish a connection with the router.
