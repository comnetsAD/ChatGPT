Each network device has a unique MAC address. They identify OSI model layer 2 data connection devices. When the host (8a:00:12:3e:d6:be) connects to the router (default gateway) with a different MAC address, MAC addresses are utilized. The host requests the router's MAC address using ARP. The host then connects to the router using its MAC address. The router sends data packets to the host using the host's MAC address. The router utilizes the host's MAC address to monitor its network position and send data packets to the right device. Thus, MAC addresses are used to establish a connection with the router and subsequently to forward data packets and monitor the host's network position.
