Media Access Control addresses, often known as MAC addresses, are one-of-a-kind identifiers that are given to any device that is connected to a network. On the data connection layer (layer 2) of the OSI model, they are put to use to identify the various devices present. During the process of communication, MAC addresses are employed when the host, which has the MAC address 8a:00:12:3e:d6:be, makes a connection with the router, which is assigned with a different MAC address than the host. The router is considered the default gateway. A request using the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) is sent from the host to the router, in which the MAC address of the router is requested. The host then makes advantage of the router's MAC address in order to establish a connection with the router once it has responded with its own. After the host has been successfully connected to the router, the router will make use of the host's Media Access Control (MAC) address in order to deliver data packets to the host. The router makes use of the host's Media Access Control (MAC) address not only to determine where the host is located on the network but also to guarantee that data packets are only sent to the intended recipient device. As a result, media access control (MAC) addresses are used at the beginning of the communication process to establish a connection with the router. MAC addresses are also utilized during the communication process to forward data packets and to maintain track of the host's position on the network.
