The host in this example has the MAC address "8a:00:12:3e:d6:be," which is a distinctive physical address allocated to network devices known as MAC (Media Access Control) addresses. They are used for local area network device identification and addressing (LAN). When the host establishes a connection with the router (default gateway) to access the website, MAC addresses are utilized throughout the communication process. The host requests the MAC address associated with the router's IP address "135.168.1.1" by sending an ARP (Address Resolution Protocol) request to the router. The host may then connect to the router by sending it an ARP reply that includes the router's MAC address. In conclusion, MAC addresses are specific physical addresses given to network equipment and are used to identify and address equipment on a LAN. When the host establishes a connection with the router via the ARP protocol, they are utilized throughout the communication process.
