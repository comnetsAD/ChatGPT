MAC addresses, which stand for "Media Access Control," are one-of-a-kind, physical addresses that are given to network devices. For example, the device that is acting as the host in this scenario has a MAC address that looks like this: 8a:00:12:3e:d6:be. On a local area network, they are used for the purpose of identifying and addressing the various devices (LAN). MAC addresses are made use of throughout the process of communication whenever the host device makes a request to the router (which acts as the default gateway) to create a connection with the website in question. Because it is important for the host device to identify the router in order to establish a connection, it sends an Address Resolution Protocol, or ARP, request to the router. This allows the router to obtain the host device's media access control (MAC) address. This ARP request is sent out to all of the devices connected to the LAN, and in response, the router provides its MAC address. This enables the host device to establish a connection and submit the DNS request. In a nutshell, media access control (MAC) addresses are exclusive physical addresses that are issued to network devices. These addresses are used to identify and address devices that are part of a local area network (LAN). They come into play during the phase of the process known as communication in which the host device makes an ARP request to the router in order to ascertain the latter's MAC address before beginning the process of establishing a connection.
