A host name is a unique identifier issued to a network device, such as "myhost.mysubnet.com" in this example. It is used for human-readable identification and network device organization. In contrast, a host IP address is a numerical identifier allocated to each device on a network, such as "135.168.1.50" in this example. It is used for network routing and addressing applications. Initially, the hostname "myhost.mysubnet.com" is used to establish a connection with the website "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com" in this procedure. However, the host name must be converted into the IP address of the host in order to create the connection. The Domain Name System (DNS) comes into action at this point. The host makes a DNS query to the DNS IP address 8.8.8.8, requesting the IP address corresponding to the host name "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com." After receiving the IP address from the DNS server, the host utilizes it to create a connection with the website. The host name is used for identification and organization, but the IP address is used for routing and addressing. The host name is first used to begin the connection, but before the connection can be formed, it is converted into an IP address using DNS.
