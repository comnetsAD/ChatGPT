A device on a network is given a host name, which is a distinct name, in this case "myhost.mysubnet.com," that is granted to it by the network administrator. Devices in a network may be organized and identified in a way that is readable by humans using this information. A host IP address, on the other hand, is a numerical identifier that is allocated to each device on a network. In this situation, the host IP address is "135.168.1.50." On the network, it is used for addressing and routing reasons respectively. During this procedure, a connection with the website "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com" is established by first using the host name "myhost.mysubnet.com," which is provided by the user. However, in order to successfully establish the connection, the host name must first be converted into the corresponding IP address of the host. The Domain Name System, abbreviated as DNS, comes into action at this point. A DNS query is sent from the host to the DNS IP address of 8.8.8.8, requesting for the IP address that corresponds to the host name "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com." The host will make use of the IP address after it has been returned by the DNS server in order to create a connection with the website. In a nutshell, the host name is used for the purposes of identification and organization, whilst the host IP address is utilized for the purposes of routing and addressing. Before the connection can be made, the host name must first be resolved via the Domain Name System (DNS) into the corresponding host IP address. This must occur before the connection can be made.
