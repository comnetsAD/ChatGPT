A host name, in this case "myhost.mysubnet.com," is a distinctive name given to a device on a network. It is used to organize and identify devices on a network in a way that is human-readable. On the other hand, each device on a network is given a host IP address, which in this case would be "135.168.1.50." On the network, it is utilized for addressing and routing reasons. In this procedure, a connection to the website "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com" is first established using the host name "myhost.mysubnet.com." However, in order to create the connection, the host name must be converted into a host IP address. The Domain Name System (DNS) is used in this situation. The host requests the IP address for the host name "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com" by sending a DNS request to the DNS IP address of 8.8.8.8. The host uses the IP address received from the DNS server to connect to the website. In conclusion, the host name serves as a means of organization and identification whereas the host IP address serves as a means of routing and addressing. The connection is originally made using the host name, but before it can be established, DNS must transform the host name into a host IP address.
