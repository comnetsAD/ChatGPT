Internet Protocol (IP): This protocol is used to route the DNS query and response packets through the internet. It is used because it provides the necessary addressing information for the packets to reach their destination.  In summary, the host uses UDP to quickly send a DNS query to the DNS server and receive a response. The DNS server uses TCP to send recursive queries to other DNS servers on the internet and receive responses in a reliable manner.

IP is used to route the packets through the internet to their destination.  This device's host name is "myhost.mysubnet.com." For human-readable network device identification and organization. In contrast, a host IP address is a numerical label allocated to each device on a network, such as "135.168.1.50" in this case. It routes and addresses the network. "Myhost.mysubnet.com" is utilized to connect to "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com" in this procedure. The host name must be converted into a host IP address to initiate the connection. This is where DNS comes in. The host requests "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.comIP "'s address from 8.8.8.8. The host connects to the website using the DNS server's IP address. In summary, the host IP address routes and addresses, whereas the host name identifies and organizes. DNS converts the host name into a host IP address before the connection is created.
