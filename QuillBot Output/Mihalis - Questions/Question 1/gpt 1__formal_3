A host name is a human-readable label issued to a networked device, such as a computer or router. It identifies the device on the network and consists of a string of alphanumeric characters separated by periods, such as "myhost.mysubnet.com." In contrast, a host IP address is a numerical designation issued to a device on a network. It is commonly expressed as four octets separated by periods, such as "135.168.1.50", and is used to identify and find the device on the network. In order to make a connection with www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com, the client device first uses the host name to conduct a DNS (Domain Name System) query. The Domain Name System (DNS) is a decentralized database that maps domain names to IP addresses. The client device makes a request to the DNS server given in its network setup (8.8.8.8) to translate "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com" to its IP address. After receiving the IP address, the client device may use the IP address of the host to create a connection with the target website. Host names are used to identify and find devices on a network in a human-readable manner, while host IP addresses are used in a numeric format. The host name is used to conduct a DNS query to resolve the domain name to an IP address, and the host's IP address is then used to establish the connection.
