Internet Protocol (IP): This protocol is used to route the DNS query and response packets through the internet. It is used because it provides the necessary addressing information for the packets to reach their destination.  In summary, the host uses UDP to quickly send a DNS query to the DNS server and receive a response. The DNS server uses TCP to send recursive queries to other DNS servers on the internet and receive responses in a reliable manner. IP is used to route the packets through the internet to their destination.  Internet Protocol (IP): This protocol is used to route the DNS query and response packets through the internet.

A device on a network is given a host name, which is a distinct name, in this case "myhost.mysubnet.com," that is granted to it by the network administrator. Devices in a network may be organized and identified in a way that is readable by humans using this information. A host IP address, on the other hand, is a numerical identifier that is allocated to each device on a network. In this situation, the host IP address is "135.168.1.50." On the network, it is used for addressing and routing reasons respectively. During this procedure, a connection with the website "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com" is established by first using the host name "myhost.mysubnet.com," which is provided by the user. However, in order to successfully establish the connection, the host name must first be converted into the corresponding IP address of the host. The Domain Name System, abbreviated as DNS, comes into action at this point. A DNS query is sent from the host to the DNS IP address of 8.8.8.8, requesting for the IP address that corresponds to the host name "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com." The host will make use of the IP address after it has been returned by the DNS server in order to create a connection with the website. In a nutshell, the host name is used for the purposes of identification and organization, whilst the host IP address is utilized for the purposes of routing and addressing. Before the connection can be made, the host name must first be resolved via the Domain Name System (DNS) into the corresponding host IP address. This must occur before the connection can be made.
