A host name is a label that can be read by humans that is given to a networked device, such as a computer or router. It normally consists of a string of alphanumeric characters separated by periods, such as "myhost.mysubnet.com," and is used to identify the device on the network. On the other hand, a network device is given a numerical label known as a host IP address. It normally has the form of four octets separated by periods and is used to identify and find the device on the network, for example, "135.168.1.50". The host name is used by the client device to do a DNS (Domain Name System) lookup before attempting to connect to www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com. A distributed database called the DNS converts domain names to IP addresses. The client device attempts to resolve the host name "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com" to the IP address supplied by the DNS server (8.8.8.8) in its network configuration. The client device may use the host IP address after receiving the IP address to start a connection with the destination website. In conclusion, host names are used to find and identify devices on a network in a human-readable manner, while host IP addresses are used to do so in a numerical format. When a DNS query to translate a domain name to an IP address is launched using the host name, the host IP address is then used to launch the connection.
