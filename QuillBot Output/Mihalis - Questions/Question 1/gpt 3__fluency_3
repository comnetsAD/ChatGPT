A host name is a unique identifier issued to a network device, such as "myhost.mysubnet.com" in this case. It is used for human-readable device identification and network device categorization. In contrast, a host IP address is a numerical label allocated to each device on a network, such as "135.168.1.50" in this case. It is used on the network for routing and addressing. Initially, the host name "myhost.mysubnet.com" is used to establish a connection with the website "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com." However, in order for the connection to be created, the host name must be translated into a host IP address. The Domain Name System (DNS) comes into play here. The host makes a DNS request to 8.8.8.8, requesting the IP address associated with the host name "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com." When the DNS server delivers the IP address, the host uses it to connect to the website. In summary, the host name serves as identification and organization, while the host IP address serves as routing and addressing. The host name is used to begin the connection, but it must be translated into a host IP address through DNS before the connection can be formed.
