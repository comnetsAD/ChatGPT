A host name is a human-readable label that is given to a network equipment such as a computer or a router. It is used to identify the device on the network and is often consisting of a sequence of alphanumeric characters separated by periods, such as "myhost.mysubnet.com". A host IP address, on the other hand, is a numerical designation that is allocated to a network device. It is used to identify and find the device on the network, and it is commonly expressed as four octets separated by periods, such as "135.168.1.50". The host name is initially used by the client device to conduct a DNS (Domain Name System) lookup when connecting to www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com. The Domain Name System (DNS) is a distributed database that maps domain names to IP addresses. To resolve the host name "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com" to its associated IP address, the client device makes a request to the DNS server defined in its network settings (8.8.8.8). After receiving the IP address, the client device may use the host IP address to connect to the destination website. In summary, host names are used to identify network devices in a human-readable manner, while host IP addresses are used to identify and locate network devices numerically. The host name is used to launch a DNS query to resolve the domain name to an IP address; after the IP address is obtained, the host IP address is used to establish the connection.
