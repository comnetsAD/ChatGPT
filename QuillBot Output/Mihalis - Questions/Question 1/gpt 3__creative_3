Host names, such "myhost.mysubnet.com," identify specific devices on a network. It's purpose is to provide an easy-to-read catalog of all the network nodes. In contrast, "135.168.1.50" is an example of a host IP address, a numeric identification allocated to each device on a network. It serves the network's addressing and routing needs. In this procedure, we first connect to the website "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com" through the host name "myhost.mysubnet.com." However, the connection cannot be created until the host name is resolved to an IP address. The DNS (Domain Name System) is used for this purpose. To find out what IP address corresponds to the hostname "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com," the host issues a DNS query to the DNS IP address of 8.8.8.8. The host then uses the IP address returned by the DNS server to communicate with the website. In conclusion, the host name serves identification and classification functions whereas the host IP address performs routing and addressing functions. Before a connection can be made, the host name must be resolved by DNS to return the corresponding host IP address.
