A computer or a router, for example, will have what is known as a host name, which is a label that is readable by humans, given to it when it is connected to a network. It is used to identify the device on the network and is normally formed of a sequence of alphanumeric characters separated by periods. For example, "myhost.mysubnet.com" is an example of an IP address. On the other hand, a host IP address is a numerical label that is issued to a device that is connected to a network. It is used to both identify and locate the device on the network, and it is commonly expressed in the form of four octets that are separated by periods, such as "135.168.1.50." The client device makes use of the host name in order to do a DNS (Domain Name System) lookup before proceeding with the process of establishing a connection with www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com. This step is the first step in the process. The Domain Name System (DNS) is a decentralized database that converts domain names to their corresponding IP addresses. In order to determine the IP address that corresponds to the host name "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com," the client device must first submit a request to the DNS server that was defined in its network configuration (8.8.8.8). When the IP address is obtained, the client device may make use of the IP address of the host to establish communication with the website that is the focus of its attention. Host names, in a nutshell, are used to identify devices on a network in a format that is legible by humans, while host IP addresses are used to identify and locate devices on a network in a format that is readable by computers. Once the domain name has been resolved to an IP address using the host name, the connection may then be made using the host's IP address. The host name is first used to conduct a DNS query in order to resolve the domain name.
