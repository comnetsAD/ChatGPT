Internet Protocol (IP): This protocol is used to route the DNS query and response packets through the internet. It is used because it provides the necessary addressing information for the packets to reach their destination.  In summary, the host uses UDP to quickly send a DNS query to the DNS server and receive a response. The DNS server uses TCP to send recursive queries to other DNS servers on the internet and receive responses in a reliable manner. IP is used to route the packets through the internet to their destination.  Internet Protocol (IP): This protocol is used to route the DNS query and response packets through the internet.

It's purpose is to provide an easy-to-read catalog of all the network nodes. In contrast, "135.168.1.50" is an example of a host IP address, a numeric identification allocated to each device on a network. It serves the network's addressing and routing needs. In this procedure, we first connect to the website "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com" through the host name "myhost.mysubnet.com." However, the connection cannot be created until the host name is resolved to an IP address. The DNS (Domain Name System) is used for this purpose. To find out what IP address corresponds to the hostname "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com," the host issues a DNS query to the DNS IP address of 8.8.8.8. The host then uses the IP address returned by the DNS server to communicate with the website. In conclusion, the host name serves identification and classification functions whereas the host IP address performs routing and addressing functions. Before a connection can be made, the host name must be resolved by DNS to return the corresponding host IP address.
