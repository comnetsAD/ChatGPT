Internet Protocol (IP): This protocol is used to route the DNS query and response packets through the internet. It is used because it provides the necessary addressing information for the packets to reach their destination.  In summary, the host uses UDP to quickly send a DNS query to the DNS server and receive a response. The DNS server uses TCP to send recursive queries to other DNS servers on the internet and receive responses in a reliable manner. IP is used to route the packets through the internet to their destination.  Internet Protocol (IP): This protocol is used to route the DNS query and response packets through the internet. It is used because it provides the necessary addressing information for the packets to reach their destination. It is used to organize and identify devices on a network in a way that is human-readable. On the other hand, each device on a network is given a host IP address, which in this case would be "135.168.1.50." On the network, it is utilized for addressing and routing reasons. In this procedure, a connection to the website "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com" is first established using the host name "myhost.mysubnet.com." However, in order to create the connection, the host name must be converted into a host IP address. The Domain Name System (DNS) is used in this situation. The host requests the IP address for the host name "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com" by sending a DNS request to the DNS IP address of 8.8.8.8. The host uses the IP address received from the DNS server to connect to the website. In conclusion, the host name serves as a means of organization and identification whereas the host IP address serves as a means of routing and addressing. The connection is originally made using the host name, but before it can be established, DNS must transform the host name into a host IP address.
