Internet Protocol (IP): This protocol is used to route the DNS query and response packets through the internet. It is used because it provides the necessary addressing information for the packets to reach their destination.  In summary, the host uses UDP to quickly send a DNS query to the DNS server and receive a response. The DNS server uses TCP to send recursive queries to other DNS servers on the internet and receive responses in a reliable manner. IP is used to route the packets through the internet to their destination.  Internet Protocol (IP): This protocol is used to route the DNS query and response packets through the internet.

IP is used to route the packets through the internet to their destination.  A host name is a unique identifier issued to a network device, such as "myhost.mysubnet.com" in this example. It is used for human-readable identification and network device organization. In contrast, a host IP address is a numerical identifier allocated to each device on a network, such as "135.168.1.50" in this example. It is used for network routing and addressing applications. Initially, the hostname "myhost.mysubnet.com" is used to establish a connection with the website "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com" in this procedure. However, the host name must be converted into the IP address of the host in order to create the connection. The Domain Name System (DNS) comes into action at this point. The host makes a DNS query to the DNS IP address 8.8.8.8, requesting the IP address corresponding to the host name "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com." After receiving the IP address from the DNS server, the host utilizes it to create a connection with the website. The host name is used for identification and organization, but the IP address is used for routing and addressing. The host name is first used to begin the connection, but before the connection can be formed, it is converted into an IP address using DNS.
