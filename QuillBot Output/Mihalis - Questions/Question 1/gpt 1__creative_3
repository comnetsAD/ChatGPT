A computer or router, for example, will be given a host name, which is a human-readable label. Names like "myhost.mysubnet.com" serve as examples of such network identifiers, consisting of a string of alphanumeric letters separated by periods. In contrast, a host IP address is a numerical identifier for a computer or other network node. Addresses like "135.168.1.50" employ four octets separated by periods to uniquely identify and locate a device on a network. When a client wants to connect to www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com, it first uses the host name to do a DNS (Domain Name System) lookup. In order to connect domain names with numerical IP addresses, there is a central database known as the Domain Name System (DNS). In order to determine the IP address that corresponds to the host name "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com," the client device contacts the DNS server that was previously set up in its network setup (8.8.8.8). The client device may then use the host IP address to establish a connection with the desired website after receiving the IP address. In conclusion, host names are used to identify devices in a human-readable manner on a network, whereas host IP addresses are used to identify and find devices in a numerical format. It is the host IP address that is used to establish the connection once a DNS query has been sent in order to resolve the domain name to an IP address.
