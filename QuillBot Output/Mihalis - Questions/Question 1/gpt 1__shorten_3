A network device's host name is human-readable. "Myhost.mysubnet.com" is a standard network device ID. A network device's host IP address is a numerical label. Its four octets separated by periods identify and locate the device on the network, such as "135.168.1.50". The client device initially queries DNS using the host name to connect to www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com. DNS translates domain names to IP addresses. The client device asks its network configuration's DNS server (8.8.8.8) to resolve "www.cyberwarfarenyuad.com" to its IP address. The client device may connect to the target website using the host IP address after receiving the IP address. In summary, host names identify devices on a network in a human-readable fashion, whereas host IP addresses identify and locate them numerically. The host name initiates a DNS query to resolve the domain name to IP address, and the host IP address initiates the connection.
