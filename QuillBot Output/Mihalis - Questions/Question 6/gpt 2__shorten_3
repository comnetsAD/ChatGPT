Ransomware is the cyberthreat. Ransomware encrypts data and wants bitcoin to unlock them. Ransomware attackers want money. Phishing emails, exploit kits, and drive-by downloads may transmit ransomware. Ransomware encrypts the victim's data and displays a ransom note with instructions on how to pay. The victim has a deadline to pay the ransom before the decryption key is removed, making the contents forever unavailable. The FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center recorded 4,086 ransomware assaults in 2019, costing $11.5 million. In 2018, 2,573 assaults cost $3.6 million. Ransomware attacks may be costly since not all victims report them or reveal the ransom paid. Cybersecurity Ventures predicts that ransomware will cost $11.5 billion by 2021. Backup, disaster recovery, endpoint protection, and staff training help battle ransomware. WannaCry and Petya are ransomware. In May 2017, WannaCry hit over 200,000 individuals in 150 countries. Petya ransomware encrypts the victim's master boot record, leaving it useless.
