Ransomware is a major cyberthreat that has become widespread in recent years. Ransomware is a form of virus that encrypts the data of a victim and demands money in return for the decryption key. The objective for deploying ransomware is financial gain. As corporations and organizations are more likely to pay the ransom to recover access to their sensitive data, attackers often target them. The distribution mechanism for ransomware might vary, although it is often distributed through phishing emails or software flaws. Once Ransomware infects a device, it encrypts the victim's data and presents a demand for money in return for the decryption key. A ransomware assault may have disastrous effects on a company or organization, which may lose access to crucial data and be required to pay a ransom to restore access. According to statistics from the Cyber Threat Alliance, the number of Ransomware assaults has steadily increased over the previous several years. In 2016, there were around 4,000 Ransomware assaults every quarter, and in 2017, there were over 6,000 attacks per quarter. This information originates from the Cyber Threat Alliance's Ransomware Intelligence Report. The cost of Ransomware attacks might vary based on the organization's size and the quantity of encrypted data. The cost of ransomware attacks is expected to reach $11.5 billion by 2019, according to a research by Cybersecurity Ventures. This cost consists of both the ransom payments and the costs associated with recovering from the assault. Implementing frequent backups, keeping software up-to-date, and training staff about the hazards of phishing emails are all solutions against ransomware. WannaCry and Petya are two instances of ransomware. In 2017, the WannaCry ransomware assault infected approximately 200,000 devices in 150 countries. In 2017, Petya was another Ransomware assault that harmed companies and organizations globally.
