Ransomware has been recognized as the most recent cyber-threat. Ransomware is a sort of malware that encrypts a victim's data and demands payment in return for the decryption key, generally in the form of cryptocurrency. The attackers' goal for deploying ransomware is financial gain. Ransomware distribution techniques vary, but popular ways include phishing emails, exploit kits, and drive-by downloads. Once sent and executed, ransomware encrypts the victim's data and displays a ransom note, generally with instructions on how to pay the ransom. The victim is then given a deadline to pay the ransom before the decryption key is removed, rendering the contents unavailable for good. According to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center, there were 4,086 documented ransomware attacks in 2019, totaling $11.5 million in losses. This is a considerable rise over 2018, when there were 2,573 recorded assaults resulting in a $3.6 million damage. In terms of cost, estimating the precise cost of ransomware attacks may be challenging since not all victims report the assaults or reveal the amount paid in ransom. However, according to a Cybersecurity Ventures analysis, the yearly cost of ransomware is estimated to hit $11.5 billion by 2021. Backup and disaster recovery, endpoint protection, and staff education and training may all be used to battle ransomware. WannaCry and Petya are two instances of ransomware. In May 2017, WannaCry was a worldwide ransomware assault that impacted over 200,000 people in 150 countries. Petya is a ransomware attack that encrypts the victim's master boot record, leaving the machine useless.
