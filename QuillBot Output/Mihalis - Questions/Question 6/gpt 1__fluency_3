Ransomware is the cyberthreat I've selected for today. By encrypting victims' data and requesting payment in return for the decryption key, ransomware is used to extract money from its victims. Typically, phishing emails or malicious software downloads are used as the distribution technique. After being downloaded, the ransomware encrypts the victim's data and demands bitcoin in return for the decryption key. Depending on the volume of data encrypted and how crucial the data is to the victim, the effects of a ransomware attack may vary from minor to catastrophic. In certain situations, victims may choose to pay the ransom in order to recover access to their data, while in others, they may decide to employ decryption tools or restore their data from backups. The amount of ransomware assaults has been gradually rising over the last several years, according to statistics from the Cyber Threat Alliance, with a notable jump in 2016 and 2017. Approximately 4,000 ransomware assaults per day were recorded in 2016, and by 2017, that number had increased to 6,000 per day. The Cyber Threat Alliance, the FBI, and cybersecurity firms like Symantec and McAfee are among of the sources utilized for this data. Attacks using ransomware have also become more expensive over time. Cybersecurity Ventures estimates that the price of ransomware attacks will be $11.5 billion in 2019. This costs more than the $325 million that was projected to be spent in 2015. The rise in assaults and the complexity of the ransomware being utilized are to blame for the cost increase. Implementing reliable backups, training staff to recognize and avoid phishing emails, and putting endpoint security software in place are all ways to combat ransomware. The ransomware strains Petya and WannaCry are two instances. In May 2017, a worldwide ransomware assault called WannaCry affected more than 200,000 people in 150 different countries. In June 2017, the Ukrainian international airport and metro system were hit by the Petya ransomware assault, which also hit the Danish shipping company Maersk.
