The selected modern cyberthreat is Ransomware. Ransomware is a kind of malware that encrypts a victim's data and demands payment in return for the decryption key, often in the form of cryptocurrency. The attackers' goal for using ransomware is financial gain. There are several techniques for delivering ransomware, including phishing emails, exploit kits, and drive-by downloads. After ransomware has been sent and launched, it encrypts the victim's data and displays a ransom note, which often includes instructions on how to pay the ransom. The victim is then given a deadline to pay the ransom before the decryption key is permanently lost, rendering the contents unavailable forever. According to statistics from the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Center, 4,086 ransomware incidents with a total loss of $11.5 million were recorded in 2019. This is a huge rise from 2018, when 2,573 assaults resulting in a $3.6 million loss were recorded. The actual cost of ransomware attacks might be difficult to establish since not all victims report the assaults or reveal the ransom amount paid. In contrast, Cybersecurity Ventures predicts that the yearly cost of ransomware would approach $11.5 billion by 2021. Solutions including as backup and disaster recovery, endpoint security, and personnel education and training may be used to fight ransomware. WannaCry and Petya are both instances of ransomware. In May 2017, WannaCry was a worldwide ransomware outbreak that impacted over 200,000 victims in 150 countries. Petya is a ransomware attack that renders the victim's machine useless by encrypting the master boot record.
