Ransomware is the selected modern cyberthreat. In the case of ransomware, data are encrypted and the victim is asked to pay a ransom in return for the decryption key. Financial gain is the driving force behind ransomware attacks. Ransomware may be spread in a number of ways, the most prevalent of which include spam emails, exploit kits, and drive-by downloads. Delivered and activated ransomware encrypts the victim's data and displays a ransom note, often with instructions on how to pay the ransom. The target is then given a time limit in which to pay the ransom, after which the decryption key is erased and the data is unrecoverable in any form. The Internet Crime Complaint Center at the FBI reports that $4,086 ransomware attacks cost businesses and individuals a combined $11.5 million in 2019. From 2018's 2,573 recorded assaults and $3.6 million in losses, this year's number is a considerable rise. Since not all victims report attacks or reveal the amount paid in ransom, it might be impossible to quantify the true cost of ransomware attacks. In spite of this, Cybersecurity Ventures predicts that by 2021, ransomware would cost businesses more than $11.5 billion yearly. Backup and disaster recovery, endpoint security, and staff education and training are just some of the measures that may be used to counter ransomware. WannaCry and Petya are two types of ransomware. Over 200,000 people in 150 countries were hit by the WannaCry ransomware assault in May of 2017. Petya is a kind of ransomware that encrypts the victim's computer's master boot record, making it useless.
