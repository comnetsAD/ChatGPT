Ransomware is a modern cyber-threat that has become more popular in recent years. Ransomware is a sort of virus that encrypts a victim's data and then demands payment for the decryption key. The goal of utilizing Ransomware is to gain money. Attackers often target corporations and organizations because they are more likely to pay a ransom to recover access to critical data. Ransomware may be distributed in a variety of ways, however it is most often supplied through phishing emails or software flaws. Once installed, the Ransomware encrypts the victim's data and shows a message requesting money in return for the decryption key. A ransomware attack may be disastrous for a company or organization because it can cause them to lose access to critical data and force them to pay a ransom to restore access. According to Cyber Threat Alliance statistics, the number of Ransomware assaults has steadily increased over the last several years. There were around 4,000 Ransomware assaults every quarter in 2016, which climbed to over 6,000 attacks per quarter in 2017. The Cyber Threat Alliance's Ransomware Intelligence Report was used to compile this information. The cost of a Ransomware attack varies according on the size of the company and the quantity of data encrypted. The cost of Ransomware assaults is expected to reach $11.5 billion by 2019, according to a research by Cybersecurity Ventures. This cost covers both the ransom and the expense of recovering from the assault. Regular backups, keeping software up to date, and training staff about the hazards of phishing emails are all solutions against Ransomware. WannaCry and Petya are two instances of Ransomware. In 2017, the WannaCry ransomware assault infected approximately 200,000 devices in 150 countries. Petya was another Ransomware assault that hit companies and organizations throughout the globe in 2017.
