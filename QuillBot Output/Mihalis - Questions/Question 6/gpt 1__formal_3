Ransomware is used to extort money from victims by encrypting their data and requesting payment in return for the decryption key. Typically, the malware is delivered by phishing emails or malicious software downloads. After ransomware is downloaded, it encrypts the victim's data and demands bitcoin payment in return for the decryption key. Depending on the quantity of data encrypted and the relevance of the data to the victim, the consequences of a ransomware attack might vary from minor to catastrophic. In some instances, victims may choose to pay the ransom in order to recover access to their data, while in others, they may choose to restore their data from backups or employ decryption software. The amount of ransomware assaults has progressively increased over the previous few years, with a large jump in 2016 and 2017. This information was obtained from the Cyber Threat Alliance, the FBI, and cybersecurity businesses like Symantec and McAfee. The cost rise may be due to the growing number of ransomware attacks and their increasing complexity. WannaCry and Petya are both instances of ransomware. In May 2017, WannaCry was responsible for a worldwide ransomware assault that affected over 200,000 victims in 150 countries. Petya was a ransomware assault that hit a number of prominent organizations in June 2017, including the international airport and metro system of Ukraine, as well as the Danish shipping firm Maersk.
