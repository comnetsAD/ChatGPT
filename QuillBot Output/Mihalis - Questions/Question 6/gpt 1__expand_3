Ransomware is the example that I will use to illustrate a modern cyber-threat. Ransomware is used for the purpose of financially exploiting victims by encrypting their data and then demanding payment in return for the key to decode it. This practice is known as extortion. Phishing emails or downloads of dangerous software are often the means through which the malware is distributed. After the ransomware has been downloaded, it encrypts the data of the victim and then demands payment in the form of cryptocurrency in order to provide the victim with the key to unlock the encrypted files. The volume of data that is encrypted as well as the significance of the data to the victim both have a role in determining the severity of the effects that might be caused by an assault by ransomware. In some instances, victims may decide to recover their data from backups or make use of decryption tools in order to regain access to their data. However, in other instances, victims may decide to pay the ransom in order to regain access to their data. The amount of ransomware assaults has been continuously growing over the last few years, with a notable jump in the years 2016 and 2017 according to statistics provided by the Cyber Threat Alliance. In 2016, there were roughly 4,000 recorded ransomware attacks per day, but in 2017, that number had climbed to 6,000 per day. In 2018, there have been approximately 6,000 reported ransomware assaults per day. The Cyber Threat Alliance, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), and other private cybersecurity organizations such as Symantec and McAfee were utilized as sources for this material. In addition, the cost of ransomware assaults has been steadily rising over the last several years. The cost of ransomware attacks is predicted to exceed $11.5 billion in 2019, according to a research published by Cybersecurity Ventures. This is a rise from the expected cost of $325 million in the year 2015, which has already reached this level. The expanding number of assaults and the more sophisticated nature of the ransomware that is being utilized are both likely contributing factors to the rise in costs. Implementing comprehensive backups, training personnel on recognizing and avoiding phishing emails, and installing endpoint security software are some of the solutions that may be used to combat ransomware. WannaCry and Petya are two instances of ransomware that have recently been discovered. More than 200,000 people in 150 different countries were hit by the WannaCry ransomware assault in May of 2017. The attack originated from China. Petya was a ransomware assault that occurred in June 2017 and damaged a number of well-known businesses, including as the international airport and metro system in Ukraine, as well as the Danish shipping company Maersk.
