My favourite cyberthreat of the present is Ransomware. Ransomware is used to extort money from victims by encrypting their data and then asking for money in return for the decryption key. Malicious software and links to downloads of such programs are common vectors for this kind of attack. Ransomware, once installed, encrypts the user's data and asks for bitcoin in return for the decryption key. If just a little quantity of data is encrypted, the effects of a ransomware assault may be negligible, but if a large amount of data is encrypted, the consequences may be catastrophic. Victims have two options: pay the ransom and have their data decrypted, or restore their data from a backup and try to decode it yourself. Cyber Threat Alliance statistics show that the amount of ransomware assaults has been rising gradually over the previous several years, with a notable uptick in 2016 and 2017. Ransomware assaults increased from over 4,000 per day in 2016 to over 6,000 per day in 2017. This data comes from a variety of places, including the Cyber Threat Alliance, the FBI, and private cybersecurity firms like Symantec and McAfee. The price tag associated with ransomware assaults has grown as well. Cybersecurity Ventures predicts that the total cost of ransomware attacks in 2019 will be $11.5 billion. It was previously anticipated to cost $325 million in 2015, thus this is an increase. The increased frequency of assaults and the improving quality of ransomware are to blame for the rising prices. Endpoint security software, staff training to recognize and prevent phishing emails, and reliable backups are all viable options for fending against ransomware. WannaCry and Petya are two types of ransomware. More than 200,000 people in 150 countries fell prey to WannaCry, a virus that caused widespread disruption throughout the world in May of 2017. In June of 2017, numerous prominent businesses were hit by the ransomware known as Petya. This included the international airport and metro system in Ukraine, as well as the Danish shipping company Maersk.
