Ransomware is one modern cyberthreat that has gained popularity recently. A kind of malware known as ransomware encrypts a victim's data and demands money in return for the decryption key. Making money is the driving force for the use of ransomware. Because they are more likely to pay the ransom to recover access to their crucial data, corporations and organizations are often the targets of attackers. Ransomware may be spread in a variety of ways, but its most common methods include phishing emails and software flaws. Once on a victim's device, the ransomware encrypts their data and shows a message asking for money in return for the decryption key. For a company or organization, the effects of a ransomware attack may be disastrous since they risk losing access to crucial data and even being forced to pay the ransom to get it back. The amount of Ransomware assaults has steadily increased over the last several years, according to statistics from the Cyber Threat Alliance. There were around 4,000 Ransomware assaults every quarter in 2016, while there were approximately 6,000 attacks per quarter in 2017. The Cyber Threat Alliance's Ransomware Intelligence Report served as the source for this information. Depending on the size of the company and the volume of encrypted data, ransomware attacks may cost a variety of amounts. Cybersecurity Ventures predicts that the cost of ransomware attacks would reach $11.5 billion by 2019. In addition to the price of recovering from the assault, this cost also includes the ransom payments. Implementing frequent backups, keeping software current, and teaching staff about the risks of phishing emails are all ways to combat ransomware. The ransomware strains WannaCry and Petya are two examples. In 2017, the WannaCry ransomware assault infected approximately 200,000 devices across 150 countries. Another ransomware assault that hit companies and organizations throughout the globe in 2017 was Petya.
