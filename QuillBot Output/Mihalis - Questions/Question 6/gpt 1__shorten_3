Ransomware is my cyberthreat. Ransomware encrypts data and demands money for the decryption key. Phishing emails or malware downloads provide it. After downloading, ransomware encrypts data and demands bitcoin for the decryption key. The severity of a ransomware attack depends on the quantity of data encrypted and its value to the victim. Victims may pay the ransom to get their data recovered or utilize backups or decryption tools. The Cyber Threat Alliance reports a sharp rise in ransomware assaults in 2016 and 2017. Ransomware assaults increased from 4,000 to 6,000 per day in 2017. The Cyber Threat Alliance, FBI, Symantec, and McAfee provided this material. Ransomware assaults cost more too. Cybersecurity Ventures expects ransomware attacks will cost $11.5 billion in 2019. This is up from 2015's $325 million forecast. Due to escalating assaults and ransomware complexity, costs are rising. Strong backups, phishing education, and endpoint security software may help prevent ransomware. WannaCry and Petya are ransomware. In May 2017, WannaCry ransomware affected over 200,000 people in 150 countries. In June 2017, Petya ransomware attacked Ukraine's international airport, metro system, and Danish shipping company Maersk.
