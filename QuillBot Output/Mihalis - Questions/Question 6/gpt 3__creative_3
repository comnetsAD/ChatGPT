Ransomware is a kind of modern cyber-threat that has become more common in recent years. Ransomware is malicious software that encrypts a user's data and then demands money in return for the decryption key. The goal of spreading Ransomware is, of course, financial gain. Organizations and enterprises are common targets for cybercriminals because they are more inclined to pay a ransom in order to recover their data. Ransomware may be distributed in a number of ways, the most common being by use of phishing emails or software flaws. Once Ransomware infects a system, it locks down all data until the victim pays a ransom to unlock it. If a company or organization loses access to crucial data and is forced to pay a ransom to get it back, the consequences may be catastrophic. Cyber Threat Alliance statistics show that the prevalence of Ransomware attacks has grown over time. There were around 4,000 Ransomware assaults every quarter in 2016, but that number grew to over 6,000 attacks per quarter in 2017. The Cyber Threat Alliance's Ransomware Intelligence Report is where we found this information. There is no set price for a Ransomware assault since it depends on the size of the company and the volume of data that has been encrypted. It is estimated that by 2019, the cost of Ransomware assaults would reach $11.5 billion, according to a research by Cybersecurity Ventures. All expenses incurred as a result of the assault, such as ransom payments, are included in this total. Regular backups, up-to-date software, and staff awareness of phishing emails are all effective countermeasures against ransomware. WannaCry and Petya are two popular instances of Ransomware. In 2017, a worldwide Ransomware outbreak known as WannaCry infected over 200 thousand devices in 150 countries. In 2017, Petya was yet another Ransomware outbreak that had a global impact.
