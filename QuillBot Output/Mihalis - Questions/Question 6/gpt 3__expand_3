Ransomware is a kind of modern cyber-threat that has been more widespread over the last several years. Ransomware is a sort of malicious software that encrypts the data of its victim and then demands money in order to get the key necessary to decode the contents. The pursuit of financial gain is the driving force behind the use of ransomware. Attackers often focus their attention on corporations and organizations, reasoning that these entities are more likely to pay the demanded ransom in order to recover access to their essential data. It's possible for ransomware to be distributed in a variety of ways, but phishing emails and software flaws are the most common vectors for this kind of malware. After the ransomware has successfully infected a device, it will encrypt the data of the victim and then show a message demanding money in return for the key to unlock the contents. A ransomware attack may have catastrophic effects on a company or organization because it can cause them to lose access to crucial data and force them to pay a ransom in order to recover access to the data. Over the course of the previous several years, there has been a consistent rise in the frequency of ransomware assaults, as shown by statistics provided by the Cyber Threat Alliance. There were around 4,000 assaults caused by ransomware each quarter in 2016, but that number climbed to over 6,000 attacks each quarter in 2017. This information was obtained from the Ransomware Intelligence Report published by the Cyber Threat Alliance. There is a wide range of potential costs associated with ransomware attacks, and these costs might change based on the size of the affected business and the quantity of data that has been encrypted. The cost of ransomware attacks is expected to reach $11.5 billion by 2019, as stated in a research compiled by Cybersecurity Ventures. This cost takes into account not just the payments of the ransom but also the costs associated with recovering from the assault. Implementing frequent backups, maintaining software on the most recent version, and teaching staff about the hazards of phishing emails are all potential solutions to the problem of ransomware. WannaCry and Petya are two instances of ransomware that have recently been discovered. Over 200,000 machines in 150 countries were infected with the WannaCry ransomware outbreak in 2017, which was a worldwide cyberattack. Another ransomware assault that occurred in 2017 was called Petya, and it targeted companies and organizations all across the globe.
