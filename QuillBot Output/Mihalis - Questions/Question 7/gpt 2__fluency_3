It is impossible to compare the dangers of cyber-attacks to those of physical assaults since they each have their own set of hazards and repercussions. However, cyber-attacks may be more deadly than physical strikes since they may cause widespread disruption and damage to essential infrastructure and systems. According to a Center for Strategic and International Studies research, the yearly worldwide cost of cybercrime is projected to be over $600 billion. This includes lost productivity, intellectual property theft, and reputational loss. Furthermore, the frequency of cyber-attacks has increased over time. According to Cybersecurity Ventures, there will be a cyber-attack every 11 seconds by 2021. Physical assaults, on the other hand, are often restricted in scope and have a more direct effect on persons or particular locales. However, physical assaults, such as the 9/11 terrorist strikes in the United States, may have a tremendous influence on society as well. Firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems are currently available options for defending the cyber-world against cyber-attacks. While these methods may be useful against some kinds of cyber-attacks, they are not infallible and can be circumvented by competent attackers. Furthermore, as technology advances and new weaknesses are identified, cyber-attacks grow more complex and difficult to fight against. In terms of cyber warfare, a scenario may entail a nation-state utilizing cyber-attacks to impair another country's infrastructure. They may, for example, attack power plants, transportation systems, and communication networks to impair the country's capacity to operate. They might also employ cyber-attacks to steal vital data or impede military activities. It is impossible to predict when a cyberwar will occur, but we may expect to witness an increase in cyber-attacks utilized as an instrument of conflict in the future. According to a research by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, cyber-attacks have previously been utilized in international wars. As technology advances, the chance of a cyberwar occurring in the near future grows.
