Cyberattacks have a different set of dangers and repercussions than physical attacks, so it's hard to draw comparisons between the two. The potential for widespread disruption and damage to key infrastructure and systems makes cyber-attacks potentially more hazardous than physical strikes. Cybercrime is predicted to cost the global economy over $600 billion every year, according to an analysis by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Lost productivity, theft of intellectual property, and reputational harm are all examples of the kind of expenses that fall into this category. Cyberattacks, however, have been on the rise. Cybersecurity Ventures has issued a research predicting that by 2021, there would be a cyberattack every 11 seconds. In contrast, the effects of physical assaults are often more localized and have a more direct effect on the targets or regions they are intended to affect. However, it is also true that physical assaults, such as the 9/11 terrorist strikes in the United States, may have far-reaching consequences for society. Firewalls, antivirus programs, and intrusion detection systems are only some of the current options for defending against cyber threats. While such measures may be helpful in fending off some forms of cybercrime, they are not invulnerable and can be circumvented by experienced hackers. Cyberattacks are becoming more complex and difficult to protect against as technology develops and new weaknesses are uncovered. A nation-state might engage in cyberwarfare by launching assaults on another nation's infrastructure. They might aim to disrupt the country's capacity to operate by attacking, for example, its power plants, transportation networks, or communication infrastructure. It's also possible that they may utilize cyber assaults to steal confidential data or sabotage military activities. It's hard to predict exactly when a cyberwar would break out, but we can probably expect to see more cyber-attacks utilized as a weapon in the future. A study by the Center for Strategic and International Studies found that cyberattacks had previously been employed in armed conflicts. An eventual cyberwar is seeming more and more likely as technology develops further.
