It is impossible to equate the threat of cyberattacks to that of physical assaults, given each has distinct risks and consequences. Nonetheless, it is certain that cyberattacks are getting more frequent and deadly. According to statistics from the Cyber Threat Alliance, the number of cyberattacks has continuously increased over the previous several years, with ransomware assaults seeing a major surge. Moreover, according to a survey by Cybersecurity Ventures, the cost of cyber-attacks is anticipated to increase to $11.5 billion by 2019. The present techniques for safeguarding the cyberworld from these assaults are somewhat successful, but not infallible. Regular backups, maintaining up-to-date software, and training staff about the hazards of phishing emails are a few examples of methods that may assist prevent cyberattacks. However, attackers are always discovering new methods to circumvent existing solutions, making it impossible to provide complete protection against cyberattacks. In the context of cyber warfare, a scenario may entail a nation-state initiating a cyberattack against the essential infrastructure of another country, such as its power plants or transportation networks. This might result in widespread disruption and perhaps fatalities. In addition, it might be used to steal sensitive information, interfere with communication networks, and compromise national security. Cyberwar timelines are difficult to estimate because to several variables, such as the development of new technology and political conflicts between governments. As the frequency of cyberattacks increases, however, a cyberwar is likely to occur within the next decade. Governments and businesses must be prepared for cyberwarfare and take proactive actions to avoid and minimize its impacts.
