Cyberattacks and physical attacks pose different dangers and have different effects, therefore it's hard to draw comparisons between them. But it cannot be denied that cyberattacks are growing more common and destructive. Also, Cybersecurity Ventures estimates that the total cost of cyber assaults would reach $11.5 billion by 2019. Although there are ways to mitigate the effects of cyber assaults, this protection is far from perfect. Solutions to the problem of cyber-attacks include frequent backups, regularly updated software, and staff education on the perils of phishing emails. It is impossible to properly guard against cyber-attacks since attackers are always discovering new methods to circumvent current solutions. An example of cyberwarfare would be a state-sponsored assault on a foreign country's essential infrastructure like its electrical grid or transportation network. There might be widespread chaos and possibly casualties as a result of this. Its potential uses extend to espionage, disruption of communication infrastructure, and threats to national security. Cyberwar's timeline is murky because of all the variables involved, from the evolution of new technology to rising political tensions between countries. However, given the growing frequency of cyberattacks, a full-scale cyberwar is very probable over the next decade. Governments and businesses must be ready for cyberwarfare and take preventative steps to limit its impact.
