Cyberattacks and physical attacks have different risks and effects, making comparisons impossible. Cyberattacks may impair key infrastructure and systems, making them more deadly than physical attacks. The Center for Strategic and International Studies estimates that cybercrime costs $600 billion yearly. This involves lost productivity, IP theft, and reputation loss. Over time, cyberattacks have increased. Cybersecurity Ventures anticipates 11 cyberattacks each second by 2021. Physical assaults are usually smaller and more targeted. Physical assaults, like the 9/11 terrorist strikes in the US, may also affect society. Firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems safeguard cyberspace against cyberattacks. These techniques can prevent certain cyberattacks, but trained attackers may evade them. As technology advances and weaknesses are uncovered, cyber-attacks grow more complex and harder to fight against. A nation-state might disrupt another's infrastructure through cyberwarfare. They might attack power plants, transportation, and communication networks to cripple the nation. Cyberattacks might also steal important data or hamper military operations. It's hard to predict when a cyberwar would start, but cyberattacks will undoubtedly rise. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, cyber-attacks have been employed in international wars. Technology makes cyberwars more likely.
