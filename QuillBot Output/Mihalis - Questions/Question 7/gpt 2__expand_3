It is impossible to compare the danger posed by physical assaults to the threat posed by cyberattacks since both types of attacks pose distinct dangers and have unique repercussions. On the other hand, one may argue that cyberattacks have the potential to be much more deadly than physical assaults, given that they have the ability to inflict widespread disruption and damage to essential systems and infrastructure. According to a survey compiled by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, it is estimated that the yearly cost of cybercrime throughout the world is somewhere in the neighborhood of $600 billion. This includes expenses such as lost production, theft of intellectual property, and reputational loss. In addition, the number of cyberattacks has been steadily rising over the course of recent years. On the other hand, physical assaults are often restricted in their scope and may have a more direct effect on certain persons or areas. Although these methods may be useful in preventing some kinds of cyberattacks, it is important to keep in mind that they are not infallible and may be circumvented by malicious actors with sufficient technical expertise. In addition, as technological development continues to grow and new security flaws are found, the sophistication of cyberattacks increases, making it more difficult to protect against them. In the context of cyber warfare, one possible scenario is a nation-state launching cyberattacks on the infrastructure of another country in order to cause disruption. For instance, they would aim to disable the country's capacity to operate by attacking its power plants, transportation infrastructure, and communication networks. In addition to this, they have the capability of using cyberattacks in order to steal vital information or interfere with military operations. It is impossible to provide an accurate time estimate for when a cyberwar would break out, but it is very probable that we will see a rise in the use of cyber-attacks as an instrument of warfare in the future. There have already been examples of cyber-attacks being utilized in hostilities between states, according to a research that was published by the Center for Strategic and International Studies. [Citation needed] It is becoming more likely that there will be a cyberwar in the not-too-distant future due to the ongoing advancement of technology.
