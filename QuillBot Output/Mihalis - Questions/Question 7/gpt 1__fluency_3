It is impossible to compare the dangers of cyber-attacks with physical assaults since each has its own set of hazards and consequences. Cyber-attacks, on the other hand, are growing more common and hazardous. According to Cyber Threat Alliance statistics, the number of cyber-attacks has continuously increased in recent years, with a considerable rise in the frequency of ransomware assaults. Furthermore, the cost of cyber-attacks is rising, with an estimated cost of $11.5 billion by 2019, according to a Cybersecurity Ventures analysis. To some degree, the methods available for shielding the cyber-world against these assaults are successful, but they are not failsafe. Regular backups, keeping software up to date, and training staff on the perils of phishing emails are just a few of the methods that might help safeguard against cyber-attacks. However, attackers are continually devising new methods to circumvent existing defenses, making it impossible to effectively guard against cyber-attacks. A cyber-attack on another nation's key infrastructure, such as power plants or transportation networks, might be a scenario in cyber warfare. This might result in significant disruption and perhaps loss of life. Furthermore, it has the potential to be exploited to steal critical information, disrupt communication infrastructure, and harm national security. The timing for a cyberwar is difficult to forecast since it is dependent on numerous variables, including the development of new technology and national political conflicts. However, as the number of cyber-attacks grows, a cyberwar is likely to occur within the next decade. Governments and corporations must be prepared and take proactive steps to avoid and minimize the impacts of cyberwarfare.
