Since physical attacks and cyberattacks both have different risks and outcomes, it is difficult to compare the hazard of either. However, it might be claimed that since they can seriously disrupt and harm vital systems and infrastructure, cyberattacks have a greater potential for hazard than physical ones. The Center for Strategic and International Studies said that the yearly cost of cybercrime is estimated to be over $600 billion. Costs like diminished production, intellectual property theft, and reputational harm are included. Additionally, the frequency of cyberattacks has grown over time. By 2021, a cyberattack will occur every 11 seconds, according to a Cybersecurity Ventures analysis. Physical assaults, on the other hand, tend to be more focused and have a more immediate effect on certain people or places. The 9/11 terrorist attacks in the United States are an example of how physical assaults may have a profound influence on society. Firewalls, antivirus programs, and intrusion detection systems are currently available protections against cyber-attacks. While certain forms of cyberattacks may be successfully thwarted by these techniques, they are not impenetrable and can be overridden by knowledgeable attackers. Additionally, as technology develops and new security flaws are found, cyberattacks grow more sophisticated and challenging to counter. In a scenario involving cyberwarfare, a nation-state might target the infrastructure of another country via cyberattacks. They may, for instance, attack the nation's energy sources, transportation infrastructure, and communication systems in an effort to undermine its capacity to run its affairs. Additionally, they can disrupt military activities or steal critical information through cyberattacks. It is impossible to predict with certainty when a cyberwar will occur, but it seems expected that the number of cyberattacks employed in combat will rise in the next years. There have already been cases of cyberattacks being utilized in international wars, according to a research from the Center for Strategic and International Studies. The chance of a cyberwar occurring in the near future rises as technology develops.
