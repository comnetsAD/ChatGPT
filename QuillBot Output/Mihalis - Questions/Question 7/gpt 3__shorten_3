Cyber-attacks may or may not be more hazardous than physical ones. Physical assaults may inflict instant injury, but cyber-attacks can have long-term effects. A physical assault on a structure may inflict immediate damage and injuries, whereas a cyber-attack on a company's network can lose vital data and money. Cyberattacks may have instant effects. Cyberattacks on hospital networks may interrupt crucial treatment and damage patients. Cyberattacks may target victims worldwide, unlike physical attacks. By 2021, Cybersecurity Ventures expects cybercrime will cost $6 trillion. Data breaches, cyberespionage, and key infrastructure outages cost money. Cybersecurity solutions are improving, but they are not failsafe. Firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems may prevent cyberattacks, but not completely. Two-factor authentication and frequent security upgrades may also be done by corporations, although not always. Cyberwarfare may damage power grids, transportation systems, and banking networks. This might cause significant disruption and serious injury. A nation-state might also deploy cyber-attacks to steal important information or impair its opponents' communications. Cyberwars are becoming more probable, but it's hard to predict when. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies, critical infrastructure cyber incidents have escalated from one per month in 2010 to over 200 per month in 2018. Conclusion, cyber-attacks may bring instant injury, financial loss, and long-term implications. Cybersecurity solutions are improving but not perfect. Cyberwarfare may steal critical data and impair communication infrastructure. Cyber events impacting key infrastructure are rising, making it difficult to predict a cyberwar's timing.
