It is impossible to compare the danger posed by physical assaults to the threat posed by cyberattacks since both types of attacks pose distinct dangers and have unique repercussions. In spite of this, it is abundantly obvious that malicious cyber-attacks are growing more widespread and destructive. The number of cyberattacks has been continuously growing over the last several years, with a notable rise in the frequency of ransomware assaults, according to statistics provided by the Cyber Threat Alliance. According to a research published by Cybersecurity Ventures, the total cost of all cyberattacks is expected to reach $11.5 billion by the year 2019. This figure was derived from an analysis of historical data. The solutions that are now available to safeguard the online world from these assaults are effective, but they do not provide full protection against the threats. Some examples of solutions that may assist guard against cyber-attacks include performing regular backups, maintaining software that is always up to date, and teaching personnel about the risks posed by phishing emails. However, cybercriminals are always developing new techniques to circumvent current solutions, which makes it impossible to provide complete protection against cyberattacks. In the context of cyber warfare, one possible scenario is a nation-state conducting an assault over the internet against the vital infrastructure of another country, such as its power plants or transportation networks. This has the potential to create widespread disruption and might possibly result in loss of life. In addition to this, it is also possible to use it to steal sensitive information, interfere with communication networks, and undermine national security. The length of time it will take for a cyberwar to break out is difficult to estimate since it is dependent on a wide variety of circumstances, including the progression of new technology and the political tensions that exist between states. On the other hand, given the growing amount of cyberattacks, it is quite conceivable that a full-scale cyberwar will break out within the next ten years. It is essential for nations and organizations to have a plan in place and to take preventative actions in order to reduce the risk posed by cyberwarfare and to minimize its impacts.
