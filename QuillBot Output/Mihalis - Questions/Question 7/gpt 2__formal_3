It is impossible to equate the threat of cyberattacks to that of physical assaults, since each has its own dangers and repercussions. Cyber-attacks have the potential to be more harmful than physical strikes due to their ability to inflict widespread disruption and damage to essential infrastructure and systems. A research by the Center for Strategic and International Studies estimates that the yearly worldwide cost of cybercrime is around $600 billion. This includes expenses such as lost productivity, theft of intellectual property, and reputational harm. In addition, the frequency of cyberattacks has increased over time. Cybersecurity Ventures expects that a cyber-attack will occur every 11 seconds by 2021. In contrast, physical assaults are often more targeted and have a more direct effect on certain persons or sites. However, it is vital to highlight that physical assaults, such as the 9/11 terrorist strikes in the United States, may also have a huge influence on society. There are now firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems available to safeguard the cyberworld against cyberattacks. Although these methods may be helpful in guarding against some forms of cyberattacks, they are not failsafe and can be circumvented by trained adversaries. In addition, as technology continues to develop and as new vulnerabilities are identified, cyberattacks grow more sophisticated and more difficult to fight against. In terms of cyber warfare, a nation-state might use cyberattacks to disrupt the infrastructure of another nation. They may, for instance, attack power plants, transportation systems, and communication networks in an effort to undermine the country's capacity to operate. In addition, they might use cyberattacks to steal vital data or impede military activities. It is impossible to predict when a cyberwar would occur, but it is probable that cyber-attacks as a means of conflict will expand in the future. According to a research by the Center for Strategic and International Studies, cyberattacks have previously been used in international wars. The probability of a cyberwar occurring in the near future grows as technology continues to develop.
