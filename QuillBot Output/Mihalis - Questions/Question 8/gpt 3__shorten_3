Shodan searches for internet-connected IoT devices. It helps attackers and defenders find vulnerabilities in IoT devices and network setups. Shodan can boost security and awareness among IoT device manufacturers. Shodan may search company devices and networks for vulnerabilities like unpatched software and weak passwords. This helps firms address these flaws before attackers do. Companies may also scan rivals' devices using Shodan to learn about their security policies and enhance their goods. Attackers may utilize Shodan to find susceptible IoT devices and networks. Shodan allows attackers to find vulnerable devices and exploit them to obtain unauthorized access to devices and networks. Data leaks, network interruptions, and other security events might result. Companies and organizations may use Shodan to find and fix vulnerabilities in their devices and networks. Organizations may use Shodan to find devices with weak passwords or unpatched software and repair them. Shodan may also scan networks for odd activities like new devices or devices connecting with known malicious IP addresses. CNN called Shodan "The scariest search engine on the Internet" in 2013. Shodan can detect and mitigate vulnerabilities in IoT devices and networks. The tool may help IoT device designers and sellers find and fix network and device vulnerabilities. Shodan is a strong tool for finding IoT device and network vulnerabilities. I also think the tool may be used to raise security awareness among IoT device manufacturers and find and fix network and device issues. The technology may be exploited by attackers and defenders, therefore businesses should be aware of the dangers and minimize them.
