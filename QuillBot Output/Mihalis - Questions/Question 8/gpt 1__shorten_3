Shodan searches for internet-connected IoT devices and other systems. Users may search for devices and examine IP addresses, open ports, and software versions. IoT device manufacturers may improve security and awareness using Shodan. Shodan lets firms find and safeguard their internet-connected devices. Shodan can also detect device vulnerabilities so organizations can repair them before they're exploited. Cyberattackers may utilize Shodan to discover targets. Attackers may utilize Shodan to find industrial control systems and perform targeted assaults. Attackers may also utilize Shodan to discover susceptible devices and launch assaults from them. Defenders may detect and neutralize threats using Shodan. Defenders may scan Shodan for devices like industrial control systems to detect and mitigate risks. Defenders may also use Shodan to detect device vulnerabilities and promptly fix them. CNN called Shodan "The deadliest search engine on the Internet" in 2013 owing to its misuse potential and ease of identifying vital infrastructure and other sensitive systems. Today, it's debatable. Shodan has raised awareness of IoT security vulnerabilities, which is good, but it also allows attackers to quickly discover weak devices. In conclusion, Shodan may be deployed by attackers and defenders. Shodan helps IoT device manufacturers and attackers locate weak devices. Companies should safeguard their devices and utilize Shodan properly.
