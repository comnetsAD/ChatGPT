Shodan is a search engine that crawls the internet for Internet of Things (IoT) devices and provides users with information on their network setups and open ports. Nonetheless, the same information that makes Shodan beneficial for defenders may also be exploited by attackers. One of the primary ways in which Shodan improves the security and awareness of businesses is by enabling them to uncover vulnerabilities in their own equipment. In addition, Shodan may be used to determine if a device is utilizing outdated software or firmware, which poses a significant security risk. By finding these flaws, businesses may enhance the security of their products and better safeguard their consumers. However, the same information that defenders find beneficial may also be utilized by attackers. An attacker may, for instance, utilize Shodan to discover susceptible devices and then use this knowledge to execute targeted assaults. In addition, Shodan can detect machines using default or readily guessed passwords, making it simpler for attackers to get access. Shodan may be utilized by defenders to discover and reduce possible threats, notwithstanding the dangers involved. For instance, a defender may utilize Shodan to identify devices that are susceptible to a particular vulnerability, and subsequently patch or prevent that exploit. Additionally, Shodan may be used to detect potential botnet-controlled devices, which can subsequently be disabled or blacklisted. However, it is disputed if this assertion is still accurate today. Shodan has the potential to be used maliciously, but it may also be used for good by finding weaknesses and assisting businesses in enhancing the security of their systems. Overall, Shodan may be described as a tool for both attackers and defenders. Depending on how it is used, Shodan may or may not be the "most terrifying search engine on the Internet." In the hands of a competent defender, it may be a potent instrument for enhancing security. However, in the hands of an attacker, it may be a potent vulnerability exploitation tool.
