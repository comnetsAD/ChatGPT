Shodan searches the internet for IoT devices and displays network configurations and available ports. The platform helps IoT device manufacturers detect vulnerabilities and attack routes, which improves security and awareness. Shodan's information may be utilized by attackers to exploit vulnerabilities. Shodan helps firms find device vulnerabilities to improve security and awareness. A corporation may patch a port on one of its devices that is open and susceptible to assault. Shodan may also detect obsolete firmware and applications, which poses a security concern. Companies can enhance device security and consumer protection by detecting these issues. Defenders and attackers may utilize the same information. An attacker may utilize Shodan to find susceptible devices and perform targeted assaults. Shodan may also find devices with default or easy-to-guess passwords, making them simpler to hack. Shodan may help defenses discover and minimize threats despite its hazards. A defender may utilize Shodan to find susceptible devices and patch or block them. Shodan can also discover and disable botnet-controlled devices. CNN called Shodan "The scariest search engine on the Internet" in 2013 because it can find weak devices that might be exploited in cyber assaults. This statement may no longer be true. Shodan may be used for good by uncovering flaws and helping corporations secure their devices. Shodan helps attackers and defenders. It can find vulnerabilities and attack vectors and mitigate risks. Shodan's "scariest search engine" status relies on how it's utilized. A smart defender may use it to enhance security. An attacker may use it to exploit weaknesses.
