Shodan is a search engine tailored specifically to locating IoT gadgets and other networked systems on the web. Device information such as IP address, open ports, and software version may be seen and searched for. Companies who create and sell Internet of Things devices might benefit from using Shodan since it raises security and awareness standards. Companies may use Shodan to find out whether any of their internet-connected devices are vulnerable and then take the necessary precautions to safeguard them. Shodan may also be used to keep an eye out for security flaws in devices, enabling businesses to patch up their defenses before they're exploited. In contrast, cybercriminals may utilize Shodan to scout out possible victims. As an example, attackers may utilize Shodan to look for industrial control systems and then use that knowledge to execute more precise assaults. Furthermore, attackers may utilize Shodan to locate susceptible devices and launch attacks from those compromised systems. Defenders may utilize Shodan to detect and counteract attacks to their systems. Shodan may be used by defenders to look for certain categories of devices, such industrial control systems, and then utilize the results to identify and stop threats. In addition, defenders may utilize Shodan to keep tabs on devices for security flaws, enabling them to repair them before they can be exploited. CNN called Shodan "The scariest search engine on the Internet" in 2013 because of its potential for misuse and the simplicity with which vital infrastructure and other sensitive systems may be located using the search engine. Whether or not this is still the case now depends on one's point of view. While it's great that Shodan has brought attention to the security problems of the internet of things (IoT) and linked systems, it's also a tool that may be used by attackers to locate soft targets. In conclusion, depending on the context, Shodan may be a very effective assault or defense technique. Shodan is a tool that may be used both by companies that manufacture and sell IoT devices to improve security and raise consumer awareness, and by hackers looking to exploit security flaws in consumer products. Organizations must be aware of the dangers and take appropriate measures to protect their equipment, while individuals must utilize Shodan with caution.
