Southwest Airlines and Disney are two corporations that have cultures that couldn't be more different from one another. Their commitment to providing service to customers is one of the primary cultural aspects that sets them apart from one another. Southwest has a culture that places a strong emphasis on providing excellent customer service, which is reflected in the company's mission statement, which reads as follows: "Dedication to the highest quality of Customer Service delivered with a sense of warmth, friendliness, individual pride, and Company Spirit." The firm's policies, such as its open seating policy and their "Bags Fly Free" policy, are examples of how the culture of the company is centered on the satisfaction of its customers. On the other hand, Disney has a culture that places a significant emphasis on providing its guests with enchanted moments throughout their stay at the resort. Their goal statement, which reads "To make people happy," reflects this idea well. The culture of Disney places a strong emphasis on paying close attention to detail and providing consumers with an experience that is reliable and of superior quality. This is made clear by the company's stringent dress requirement for workers, their elaborately decorated workplaces, and the way they teach their staff to engage with clients in a way that is both kind and engaging. One further way in which the cultures of these two firms are distinct from one another is the way in which they approach innovation. The culture of Southwest Airlines places a high importance on innovation, which is evident in the company's emphasis on cost-effectiveness and efficiency. The culture at Disney, on the other hand, places a high importance on original thought and the capacity to think creatively beyond the norm. This is made clear by the fact that the corporation has a long history of producing novel and forward-thinking theme park attractions, such as the very first roller coaster with a loop that goes around in a complete circle. In conclusion, Southwest Airlines and Disney have unique cultures that mirror the varied ways in which they approach providing service to their customers and innovating new products. Both of these businesses are successful because of the strong cultural values that underpin their operations, but the ways in which they put those principles into action are distinct.
