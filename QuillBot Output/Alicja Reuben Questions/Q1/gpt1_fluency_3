Southwest Airlines and Disney have very different cultures. Their devotion to customer service is one of the primary cultural elements that distinguishes them. Southwest has a strong customer-centric culture, as shown by their goal statement, "Dedication to the highest level of Customer Service given with a feeling of warmth, friendliness, individual pride, and Company Spirit." This customer-centric attitude is mirrored in the company's policies, such as open seating and the "Bags Fly Free" policy. Disney, on the other hand, has a culture that is largely focused on providing its consumers with a fantastic experience. Their mission statement reflects this: "To make people happy." Disney's culture is likewise primarily focused on attention to detail and providing consumers with a consistent, high-quality experience. This is obvious in their tight staff dress code, complex themed settings, and the way they teach their personnel to engage with clients in a polite and engaging manner. Another aspect that distinguishes these two firms' cultures is their attitude to innovation. Southwest has an innovative culture, which is shown in its emphasis on cost-effectiveness and efficiency. Disney, on the other hand, has a culture that rewards innovation and thinking beyond the box. This is reflected in the company's history of creating new and creative theme park attractions, such as the first-ever 360-degree looping roller coaster. Finally, Southwest Airlines and Disney have diverse cultures that reflect their disparities in customer service and creativity. Both firms have strong cultural principles that fuel their success, but how those values are implemented differs.
