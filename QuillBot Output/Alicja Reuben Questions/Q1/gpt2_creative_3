Even though Southwest Airlines and Disney couldn't be more different, each company's own culture has contributed to their respective success. Culturally, both Southwest and Disney have a high emphasis on providing excellent service to their customers. The "Disney enchantment" that visitors to Disney theme parks feel is a perfect example of how both corporations value offering an exceptional customer service experience. Both organizations value cooperation highly, which is another cultural norm they share. Southwest encourages its personnel to collaborate in order to offer passengers with a pleasant flight. Cast employees at Disney parks do the same thing to immerse and delight visitors. The two firms' attitudes on innovation are strikingly different from one another. Southwest has earned a reputation for its willingness to respond swiftly to market shifts and take intelligent risks in order to maintain its position as an industry leader. When compared to this, Disney is very concerned about retaining the classic aspects of their brand and protecting its "history." The way they talk to one another is another example of cultural variation. Southwest is well-known for its culture of open and honest communication with its workers. When compared to Disney, whose culture is less flat and more hierarchical, the latter emphasizes the importance of top-down communication. There is little doubt that the distinctive and productive cultures at both Southwest Airlines and Disney have contributed to their respective companies' great success. While they may have certain things in common, their distinct business structures and goals show in how they handle innovation, communication, and their respective histories.
