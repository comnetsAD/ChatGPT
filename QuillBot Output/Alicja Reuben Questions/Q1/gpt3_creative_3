Both Southwest Airlines and Disney have a distinct corporate culture that sets them apart from the competition. The two businesses place a premium on providing excellent service and making their consumers happy. Some fundamental aspects of both civilizations, however, serve to distinguish one from the other. The importance of collaboration and cooperation is highly valued in both organizations, making this a key cultural factor they share. The "no layoffs" policy and emphasis on promoting from within are examples of Southwest Airlines' "warrior spirit" and "loyalty to the team" ethos. Teamwork and cooperation are highly valued at Disney, as is the goal of providing consumers with a "wonderful" experience. Both organizations value innovation and creativity highly, which is another cultural norm they share. One of the most successful airlines in the world, Southwest Airlines is well-known for its "low-cost, high-value" approach to air travel. Disney is also well-known for being on the cutting edge of entertainment, with an emphasis on providing consumers with novel and exciting opportunities to fully immerse themselves in the stories they watch. The two firms' attitudes on risk are fundamentally different. Taking risks and striving to be a "disruptor" in the aviation business are hallmarks of Southwest Airlines' reputation. Conversely, Disney is more careful and concerned about preserving its image as a kid-friendly entertainment firm. One last important distinction between the two businesses is in how their leadership is structured. The leadership of Southwest Airlines is more hierarchical, with an emphasis on transparent decision-making and strict accountability. On the other side, Disney's leadership style is more open and democratic, with an emphasis on giving workers greater say in company matters and fostering a sense of personal responsibility for one's job. Both Southwest Airlines and Disney have a distinctive and successful company culture. But there are also significant cultural variations between the two that show up in how each country handles customer service, innovation, risk, and leadership.
