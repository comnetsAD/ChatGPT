Southwest Airlines and Disney are two enterprises that couldn't be more different from one another, yet each have distinct cultures that have led to their success. A strong commitment to providing excellent service to clients is an aspect of culture that can be seen at both Disney and Southwest Airlines. Both Southwest Airlines and Disney put a strong focus on providing its clients with high-quality service, whether it is the warm and welcoming attitude of Southwest flight attendants or the "Disney enchantment" that visitors to Disney theme parks feel while they are there. A strong feeling of cooperation is another aspect of culture that is evident in both of the firms. When working at Southwest, staff are actively encouraged to collaborate with one another in order to give consumers with a flawless travel experience. In a similar vein, the "cast members" at Disney collaborate in order to provide visitors with an experience that is both immersive and pleasurable. Both of these organizations have a very different approach to innovation, which is one of the biggest cultural differences between them. Southwest Airlines is well-known for its rapid adaptability to changes in the industry as well as its willingness to take calculated risks in order to remain one step ahead of its rivals. On the other side, Disney lays a significant amount of attention on retaining the historic aspects of their brand and protecting what they refer to as their "history." The manner in which they communicate is another example of how their cultures are distinct from one another. Everyone is encouraged to express their thoughts and share ideas at Southwest, which is one reason why the company is so well-known for its open and honest communication with its workers. On the other hand, Disney maintains a culture that is more hierarchical, with communication predominantly flowing down from the highest levels of management to the lower-level workers. In general, Southwest Airlines and Disney have both maintained distinctive cultures that have been very successful, which has contributed to the companies' overall success. Despite the fact that they have certain things in common, their approaches to legacy, communication, and innovation are quite different due to the fact that their business models and goals are very different.
