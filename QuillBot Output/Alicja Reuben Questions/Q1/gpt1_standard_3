Disney and Southwest Airlines both have extremely different corporate cultures. Their dedication to providing customer service is one of the fundamental cultural characteristics that sets them apart. The mission statement of Southwest Airlines, which reads, "Dedication to the highest level of Customer Service given with a feeling of warmth, friendliness, individual pride, and Company Spirit," captures the company's strong customer-centric culture. The company's policies, such as its "Bags Fly Free" policy and open seating policy, further demonstrate this customer-centric attitude. On the other side, Disney has a culture that places a strong emphasis on giving its consumers a wonderful experience. Their goal statement, "To make people happy," reflects this. Disney's culture places a lot of emphasis on paying close attention to the little things and giving visitors consistently top-notch service. This is seen from their stringent dress requirement for workers, their elaborately designed settings, and the way they teach their staff how to engage and be polite to clients. Their dedication to innovation is another feature that sets the cultures of these two businesses apart. Southwest has an innovative culture, which is seen in its emphasis on efficiency and cost-effectiveness. The culture at Disney, on the other hand, places a premium on originality and the capacity for creative problem-solving. This is shown by the company's history of creating cutting-edge theme park attractions, including the first-ever 360-degree looping roller coaster. As a result of their various approaches to customer care and innovation, Southwest Airlines and Disney have distinctive cultures. Although the cultures of both businesses are robust and contribute to their success, the ways in which those cultures are implemented vary.
