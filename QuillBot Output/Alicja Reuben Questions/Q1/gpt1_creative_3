There is a world of difference between the cultures of Southwest Airlines and Disney. Their dedication to customer service is a hallmark of their culture and a fundamental differentiator between them and other organizations. Southwest's commitment to providing "the finest level of Customer Service provided with a feeling of warmth, friendliness, individual pride, and Company Spirit" is indicative of the company's commitment to putting its customers first. The open seating policy and "Bags Fly Free" program are just two examples of how the company's culture prioritizes its customers. In contrast, Disney's corporate culture places a premium on providing guests with unforgettable moments. Their stated goal of "making people happy" is indicative of this. Disney's culture places a premium on paying close attention to detail and providing a reliable, high-quality service to all of its patrons. Employees must adhere to a rigorous dress code, and the stores' expensive decor and customer service training show that the company takes its image seriously. The way in which these two businesses handle innovation is just another way in which their cultures are very different from one another. Southwest's commitment to efficiency and low prices is indicative of the company's innovative culture. Disney, on the other hand, fosters an environment that encourages originality and risk-taking. This is shown by the company's track record of developing and releasing ground-breaking rides and shows for theme parks, such as the first roller coaster to have a full 360-degree loop. Finally, the differences in customer service and innovative thinking between Southwest Airlines and Disney are reflected in the companies' diverse cultures. Both organizations are driven by deep-rooted cultural beliefs, but they go about putting those principles into effect in different ways.
