Extrinsic motivation comes from outside forces. External influences might include money, bonuses, praise, or fines. Extrinsic motivation motivates individuals to complete activities or reach objectives. Intrinsic motivation, on the other hand, comes from within. Interests, values, and satisfaction are internal variables. Intrinsic motivation frequently comes from work fulfillment or delight. A sales incentive might undermine intrinsic drive. Bonuses may initially stimulate the employee to reach the quota. Over time, the employee may consider selling as a means to an end (earning the bonus) rather than a meaningful work. The employee may lose their inherent incentive to sell and become disengaged. In conclusion, extrinsic motivation encourages individuals to complete tasks or reach objectives, whereas intrinsic motivation is an internal force that drives an individual to participate in a certain activity and is typically related with personal pleasure or delight. However, extrinsic incentive alone may swamp out intrinsic motivation, resulting in lower employee engagement and satisfaction.
