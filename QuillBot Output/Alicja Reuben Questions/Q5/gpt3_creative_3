The term "extrinsic motivation" describes the influence of incentives, such as rewards and penalties, on an individual's actions. An example of an external incentive is a bonus for reaching a sales quota, whereas an example of a negative incentive is a demotion for underperformance. Although effective, extrinsic motivation has drawbacks, including the perception of control and a subsequent drop in inner drive. On the other side, the term "intrinsic motivation" is used to describe the influence that things like curiosity, interest, or pleasure have on an individual's actions. The term "intrinsic motivation" refers to the state of mind in which an individual is compelled to act of their own will because of the intrinsic value they place on the act itself, rather than in response to any external incentives or penalties. It's more likely to result in long-term behavior change since it emphasizes the individual's own agency and responsibility. A teacher presenting a candy to children who answer the questions correctly is an example of how extrinsic drive may undermine intrinsic motivation. Students will answer questions in order to get sweets, but they may not be very interested in learning or comprehending the material. The candy represents an extrinsic motivator that overpowers the student's innate interest in the subject matter. In conclusion, there are two distinct forms of motivation—extrinsic and intrinsic—that both have the potential to influence behavior, but which do so in distinct ways. Intrinsic motivation, on the other hand, is more likely to result in long-term sustainability and is more self-determined and autonomous than extrinsic incentive, which may be strong but can also weaken intrinsic motivation.
