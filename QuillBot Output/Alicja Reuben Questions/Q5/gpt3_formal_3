Extrinsic motivation refers to the external influences, such as incentives and penalties, that drive behavior. These are external incentives intended to promote or discourage certain behavior, such as a bonus for reaching a sales quota or a demotion for bad performance. Extrinsic motivation may be effective in influencing behavior, but it can also be seen as controlling and reduce intrinsic drive. Intrinsic motivation, on the other hand, refers to variables such as personal interest, curiosity, or delight that drive conduct. Intrinsic motivation is the desire to accomplish something because it is fascinating, difficult, or pleasant, as opposed to extrinsic incentives or penalties. It is regarded to be more independent and autonomous, and it is more likely to result in long-term behavior modification. An example of how extrinsic drive may undermine intrinsic motivation is when a teacher rewards pupils with sweets for answering problems correctly. The children will be motivated by the candy and will answer the questions in order to get it, but they may not be motivated to study or comprehend the material. Thus, the candy is a sort of extrinsic incentive that supplants intrinsic drive to study the information. In conclusion, extrinsic and intrinsic motivation are two distinct forms of motivation that may influence behavior, but have distinct outcomes. Extrinsic drive may be strong, but it can also reduce intrinsic motivation, while intrinsic motivation is more self-determined and autonomous and is more likely to result in long-term behavior change that is sustainable.
