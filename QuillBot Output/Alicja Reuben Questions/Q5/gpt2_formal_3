Extrinsic motivation refers to the external forces that motivate a person to participate in a certain conduct. These external variables may include prizes like money, bonuses, or acclaim, as well as punishments like fines or reprimands. Extrinsic motivation is often used to urge individuals to undertake certain activities or attain particular objectives. On the other side, intrinsic motivation refers to the internal causes that push a person to participate in a certain conduct. Personal interests, values, and a feeling of accomplishment are examples of these internal variables. Intrinsic motivation is often correlated with a feeling of personal pleasure or delight in the activity itself. When an employee receives a monetary incentive for completing a sales target, extrinsic motivation works against intrinsic motivation. Initially, the prospect of the bonus may push the employee to fulfill the quota. However, over time, the employee may consider selling as a means to an end (receiving the bonus) rather than something they like or find significant. Consequently, the person may lose his or her inner incentive to sell and become disengaged from the task. In conclusion, extrinsic motivation is a way to encourage people to perform specific tasks or achieve specific goals, whereas intrinsic motivation is an internal factor that drives an individual to engage in a particular behavior and is frequently associated with a feeling of personal satisfaction or enjoyment. However, when extrinsic motivation becomes the sole or primary driving, it may displace intrinsic motivation, resulting in reduced employee engagement and satisfaction.
