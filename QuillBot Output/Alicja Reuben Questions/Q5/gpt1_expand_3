Extrinsic motivation is the term used to describe the elements, such as incentives and penalties, that are external to a person and that push them to participate in a certain action. Motives that come from the outside, such as money, promotions, or grades, are examples of extrinsic motivation. On the other hand, the term "intrinsic motivation" refers to the internal factors that drive an individual to engage in a behavior, such as a personal interest, enjoyment, or a sense of accomplishment. Extrinsic motivation refers to the external factors that drive an individual to engage in a behavior. When a student is offered a prize for reading a book, for instance, this is an example of how extrinsic incentive may work against the student's intrinsic motivation. Before receiving the incentive, it's possible that the student had an interest in the book and was inspired to read it for his or her own personal delight. However, once the incentive is presented to the learner, they may get preoccupied with achieving the incentive to the exclusion of the book itself and lose interest in reading it. This is an example of how extrinsic motivation may "crowd-out" intrinsic motivation, as the external reward becomes the major motivator rather than the internal interest in the action. This is an example of how extrinsic motivation can "crowd-out" intrinsic motivation. Extrinsic motivation, in general, may be successful in the short term, but it might not be able to maintain the motivation over time. On the other hand, intrinsic motivation, which is based on personal interest and pleasure of the work or activity, has the potential to be more durable than extrinsic drive. In order to ensure an organization's continued success over the long term, it is critical to strike a healthy balance between intrinsic and extrinsic forms of motivation.
