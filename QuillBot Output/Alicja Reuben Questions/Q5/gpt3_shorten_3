Rewards and penalties are extrinsic motivation. These include bonuses for fulfilling sales quotas or demotions for bad performance. Extrinsic motivation may regulate behavior and lower intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation—such as personal interest, curiosity, or enjoyment—drives conduct. Intrinsic motivation comes from wanting to accomplish something because it's fun, hard, or intriguing. It is more independent and likely to affect behavior long-term. A teacher giving candies to kids who answer questions properly is an example of extrinsic incentive thwarting intrinsic motivation. Students will answer questions to acquire sweets but may not learn or grasp the material. Thus, sugar replaces intrinsic drive to study. In conclusion, extrinsic and internal incentive might affect behavior differently. Intrinsic motivation is more self-determined and likely to lead to long-term behavior change than extrinsic drive, which might lessen it.
