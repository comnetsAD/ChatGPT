The external influences that motivate behavior, such as incentives or penalties, are referred to as extrinsic motivation. External incentives, such as a bonus for completing a sales quota or a demotion for bad performance, are used to promote or discourage certain behavior. Extrinsic incentive may be effective in directing behavior, but it can also be seen as controlling and reduce intrinsic drive. In contrast, intrinsic motivation refers to internal elements that drive conduct, such as personal interest, curiosity, or pleasure. Intrinsic motivation is motivated by an internal desire to perform something because it is fascinating, difficult, or rewarding, rather than by external incentives or penalties. It is seen to be more self-determined and autonomous, and it is more likely to result in long-term behavior change that is sustainable. A teacher distributing sweets to kids who successfully answer questions in class is an illustration of how extrinsic drive may undermine intrinsic motivation. The candy will inspire the pupils to answer the questions in order to acquire the candy, but they may not be motivated to study or grasp the material. In this sense, the candy acts as an extrinsic motivator, crowding out intrinsic incentive to study the subject. To summarize, extrinsic and intrinsic motivation are two distinct forms of motivation that may influence behavior, but they have distinct impacts. Extrinsic drive may be strong, but it can also reduce intrinsic motivation, while intrinsic motivation is more self-determined and autonomous, and it is more likely to lead to long-term behavior change that is sustainable.
