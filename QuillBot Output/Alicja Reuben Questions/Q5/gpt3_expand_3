When we talk about conduct being driven by extrinsic variables, we're referring to things like incentives and penalties as examples of extrinsic motivation. External incentives are those that are provided by a third party that may either promote or discourage a certain activity. Some examples of these are a bonus for completing a sales quota or a demotion for bad performance. The capacity of extrinsic incentive to mold behavior may be impressive; but, it can also be seen as being controlling, which can reduce the level of intrinsic drive. On the other side, the term "intrinsic motivation" refers to variables that are found within an individual that drive action, such as personal interest, curiosity, or pleasure. Intrinsic motivation is the desire to do something just because it is fascinating, hard, or delightful, rather than the desire to do something only because of the incentives or punishments that are offered from the outside. It is seen as being more self-determined and independent, and it is more likely to result in behavior modification that is sustainable over the long run. A good illustration of how extrinsic drive may undermine intrinsic motivation is the scenario in which a teacher gives out candies to pupils in exchange for right answers to questions posed in class. The candy will serve as an incentive for the kids, and they will answer the questions in order to get it; but, it is possible that they will not be motivated to study or comprehend the material. When seen in this light, the candy functions as an extrinsic type of incentive, which competes with the internal kind of drive to acquire the information. In conclusion, extrinsic and intrinsic motivation are two distinct forms of motivation that may both influence a person's behavior in their own unique ways, but they do so in very different ways. Extrinsic drive may be strong, but it also has the potential to weaken intrinsic motivation. On the other hand, intrinsic motivation is more self-determined and autonomous, and it has a greater likelihood of leading to behavior change that is sustainable over the long term.
