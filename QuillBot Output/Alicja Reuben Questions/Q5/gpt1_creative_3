The term "extrinsic motivation" describes the influence of incentives, such as rewards and penalties, on an individual's decision to behave in a given way. Money, promotions, and good grades are all examples of extrinsic motivation. But intrinsic motivation comes from inside and includes things like genuine curiosity, pleasure, and pride in one's own achievements, among other things. When a student is rewarded for reading a book, for instance, the extrinsic drive works against the student's intrinsic motivation. The student could have been interested in and motivated to read the book even without the incentive. It's possible that once the incentive is presented, the student's attention will shift away from the book itself and toward the prospect of receiving the reward. Here we see how the external reward may "drown out" the more intrinsic interest in the task, leading to a situation where extrinsic motivation dominates. Even if it works in the near term, extrinsic incentive isn't always sustainable. However, the drive that comes from inside, known as "intrinsic motivation," tends to last longer since it is not dependent on external factors. Both intrinsic and extrinsic motivation are necessary for long-term success in companies.
