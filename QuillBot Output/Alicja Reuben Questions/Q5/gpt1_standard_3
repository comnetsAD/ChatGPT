Extrinsic motivation describes the outside forces, such as incentives or penalties, that influence a person's conduct. Extrinsic motivator examples include cash, accolades, or grades. Contrarily, intrinsic motivation refers to the inside forces that propel a person to perform in a certain way, such as personal interest, delight, or a feeling of success. When a student receives a prize for reading a book, this is an illustration of how extrinsic drive may undermine intrinsic motivation. The student could have been inspired to read the book for personal pleasure before the incentive if they were interested in it. Once the incentive is mentioned, however, it's possible that the learner may stop caring about the book altogether and start concentrating just on getting the prize. This is an illustration of how extrinsic motivation may "crowd-out" intrinsic motivation when the external reward replaces the intrinsic interest in the action as the main motivator. Extrinsic motivation may, in general, be helpful in the short term but may not be able to maintain motivation over time. While intrinsic motivation is based on personal interest and delight in the work or activity, it has the potential to be more long-lasting. To achieve long-term success in companies, it's critical to strike a balance between the two forms of motivation.
