Extrinsic motivation refers to the external forces that motivate a person to participate in a certain conduct. External considerations may include monetary prizes, bonuses, or accolades, as well as consequences like as fines or reprimands. Extrinsic motivation is often used to motivate individuals to do certain activities or attain specified objectives. Intrinsic motivation, on the other hand, refers to the internal causes that push a person to participate in a certain conduct. Personal interests, values, and a feeling of satisfaction are examples of internal variables. Intrinsic motivation is often related with a feeling of personal fulfillment or happiness in the activity at hand. When an employee receives a monetary incentive for exceeding a sales target, this is an example of how extrinsic motivation may undermine intrinsic drive. The prospect of a bonus may initially drive the employee to reach the quota. However, the employee may grow to see selling as a means to an end (earning the bonus) rather than something they like or find significant over time. As a consequence, the person may lose intrinsic drive to sell and become disengaged from their job. To summarize, extrinsic motivation is a method of encouraging people to perform specific tasks or achieve specific goals, whereas intrinsic motivation is an internal factor that drives an individual to engage in a specific behavior, and it is frequently associated with a sense of personal satisfaction or enjoyment. However, when extrinsic motivation becomes the only or primary motivator, it may swamp out intrinsic motivation, resulting in lower employee engagement and satisfaction.
