When we say that someone is motivated to perform in a certain way because of something outside of themselves, we are talking about extrinsic motivation. Encouragement from outside sources, or extrinsic motivation, is often used to get individuals to complete activities or reach objectives. On the other hand, when we talk about what motivates us to behave in a certain way, we're talking about what we call "intrinsic motivation." Interests, ideals, and a feeling of accomplishment are all examples of internal motivators. Individuals are more likely to be intrinsically motivated when they take pleasure in the process of accomplishing the goal. At first, the incentive of the bonus may push the worker toward completion of the quota. But after a while, the employee may not see selling as anything more than a chore to be completed in order to reach the ultimate goal (the bonus). The worker's enthusiasm for the job and desire to sell may dwindle as a consequence. To sum up, extrinsic motivation is a strategy for getting people to do things like complete tasks or reach goals, while intrinsic motivation is something that happens on the inside and typically has to do with the individual experiencing some kind of pleasure or fulfillment as a result of the behavior. However, when extrinsic motivation takes center stage, it has the potential to overshadow intrinsic motivation, which may have negative effects on an organization's productivity and morale.
