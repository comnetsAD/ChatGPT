Extrinsic motivation refers to the external forces that influence an individual's conduct, such as incentives or penalties. Money, promotions, and grades are examples of extrinsic incentive. In contrast, intrinsic motivation refers to the internal forces that motivate an individual to participate in an action, such as personal interest, pleasure, or a feeling of success. When a student receives a reward for reading a book, extrinsic incentive might obstruct intrinsic drive. Prior to receiving the prize, the student may have been intrigued by the book and inspired to read it for personal pleasure. However, after the incentive is offered, the learner may lose interest in the text and begin to concentrate only on achieving the prize. This is an example of how extrinsic motivation may "crowd out" intrinsic drive, as the external reward replaces the internal interest in the action as the main motivator. Extrinsic motivation may be beneficial in the short term, but it may not be sustainable over time. Intrinsic motivation, on the other hand, is more likely to be sustained since it is based on personal interest and pleasure of the job or activity. To achieve long-term success in organizations, it is critical to strike a balance between both forms of motivation.
