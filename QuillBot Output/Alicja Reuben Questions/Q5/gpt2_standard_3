Extrinsic motivation describes the outside forces that encourage someone to behave in a certain way. These outside forces might come in the form of incentives like cash, bonuses, or praise as well as sanctions like fines or reprimands. Extrinsic motivation is often utilized to persuade individuals to carry out certain actions or fulfill particular objectives. On the other hand, intrinsic motivation refers to the internal forces that propel a person to carry out a certain conduct. Personal interests, ideals, or a feeling of satisfaction are some examples of these internal variables. A feeling of pleasure or delight from the activity itself is often linked to intrinsic motivation. When an employee receives a monetary incentive for exceeding a sales quota, this is an illustration of how extrinsic motivation may undermine intrinsic drive. The prospect of a bonus may initially spur an employee to reach the quota. However, over time, the employee can start to see selling as nothing more than a means to a goal (earning the bonus), rather than as a rewarding or important profession. As a consequence, the worker can stop being intrinsically motivated to sell and lose interest in their job. In conclusion, intrinsic motivation is an internal factor that drives an individual to engage in a particular behavior and is frequently associated with a sense of personal satisfaction or enjoyment. Extrinsic motivation is a way to encourage people to perform specific tasks or to achieve specific goals. Extrinsic motivation, however, may displace intrinsic motivation if it becomes the sole or primary motivator, which would decrease employee engagement and satisfaction.
