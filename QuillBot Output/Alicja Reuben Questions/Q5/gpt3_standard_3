Extrinsic motivation describes the outside forces, such incentives or penalties, that motivate conduct. These are extraneous rewards that are meant to promote or prevent certain behaviors, such a bonus for exceeding a sales quota or a promotion for subpar work. Although it may be effective in influencing behavior, extrinsic motivation can sometimes be seen as dominating and detract from intrinsic motivation. On the other side, intrinsic motivation refers to internal forces that motivate conduct, such as individual interest, curiosity, or pleasure. In contrast to being motivated by incentives or punishments from others, intrinsic motivation is the urge to achieve something because it is interesting, difficult, or delightful. It is seen to be more self-determined and autonomous, and it is more likely to result in a long-lasting, sustainable change in behavior. An example of how extrinsic incentive may undermine intrinsic drive is a teacher rewarding pupils with sweets for answering class questions correctly. The candy will inspire the pupils to answer the questions and earn them candy, but they may not be driven to study or comprehend the material. In this approach, the candy interferes with intrinsic drive to understand the content by acting as an external source of incentive. In summary, both extrinsic and intrinsic motivation have the potential to influence behavior, but they do so in different ways. Extrinsic drive may be effective, but it can also undermine intrinsic motivation, which is more likely to result in long-lasting, sustainable behavior change since it is more autonomous and self-determined.
