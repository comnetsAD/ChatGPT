Do you think ABC is more mechanical or organic? Based on the facts presented, ABC Corp. seems to have a more mechanical organizational structure and management style. Mechanistic organizations exhibit high levels of formalization, centralization, and specialization. They are usually highly organized and have a clear hierarchy of authority, with decision-making power concentrated at the organization's upper echelons. They also have a set of rules and procedures that workers must follow, and job descriptions are often fixed and carefully defined. ABC Corp. has a CEO to whom everyone reports via a few supervisors, and low-level workers have minimal decision-making capacity. The organization has well-documented processes, and each employee's job description is meticulously developed and fixed. These traits fit a mechanistic organizational system. Organic organizations, on the other hand, have a more flexible, decentralized structure, with decision-making authority dispersed across the organization. They are less institutionalized, with a focus on employee liberty and creativity rather than rules and processes. They are more adaptive to change and approach problem-solving in a more flexible manner. In the instance of ABC Corp., such traits do not exist. As a result, it is seen as more mechanical than organic.
