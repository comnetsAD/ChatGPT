Which description of ABC best fits your opinion: the mechanical or the organic? According on the material that has been presented, it would seem that ABC Corporation has a more mechanical approach to management, both in terms of its organizational structure and its overall management philosophy. Mechanistic organizations are easily identifiable by the high levels of formalization, centralization, and specialization that they exhibit. They are often highly organized and include an obvious chain of command, with the ability to make decisions being concentrated at the highest levels of the organization. In addition to this, they often have a well-defined set of policies and procedures that workers are required to adhere to, and job descriptions are typically static and have a limited scope. In the instance of ABC Corporation, the firm is led by a CEO to whom everyone reports through a small number of managers, and low-level workers have very little say in the decisions that the company makes. The organization follows processes that are well recorded, and the job descriptions that are provided to each employee are meticulously prepared and do not change. These qualities are congruent with an organizational structure that is more mechanical in nature. On the other side, organic organizations are characterized by a structure that is more flexible and decentralized, with decision-making authority spread across the company. These organizations are known as "flat hierarchies." They tend to be less structured, with less focus on rules and processes, and more emphasis on employee autonomy and creativity. This is because they place a greater premium on employee autonomy and creativity. They are often more open to new experiences and have a mindset that is more flexible when it comes to finding solutions to problems. In the instance of ABC Corporation, none of those qualities can be said to apply to the business. As a result, we classify it as more of a mechanical than an organic phenomenon.
