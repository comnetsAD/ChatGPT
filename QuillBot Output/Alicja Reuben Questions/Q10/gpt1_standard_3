According to the facts given, it seems that ABC Corp.'s organizational structure is more mechanical. A mechanistic organization is one that has a structured structure, strong centralization, and distinct lines of power. It is distinguished by a high level of formalization, with stringent guidelines for employee conduct in the form of rules and procedures. Additionally, it is distinguished by a distinct division of labor and a high level of staff specialization. A CEO is at the top of ABC Corp.'s structure, and a few managers answer to him or her. Low-level personnel have little decision-making power, and the business has rigid job definitions and extensively documented processes. This implies that the business is very centralized and adheres to rigid policies and processes. Additionally, it implies that the business has a distinct division of labor and is specialized. An organic organization, on the other hand, has a flatter hierarchy, a more adaptable structure, and is more decentralized. It is distinguished by having a high level of autonomy and a low level of formalization. Additionally, it is distinguished by a high level of cross-functional cooperation and a more flexible method of decision-making. With this knowledge, ABC Corp. seems to be more mechanical than organic. A mechanistic organization may work well in a stable environment because it permits distinct lines of authority, established processes, and effective resource utilization.
