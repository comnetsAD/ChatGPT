According to the information that was presented, the organizational structure of ABC Corporation is more mechanical in nature. Mechanistic organizations are easily identifiable by the high levels of formalization, centralization, and specialization that they exhibit. They have a distinct chain of command that is accompanied by a well-defined organizational structure, complete with roles and duties. This is clear to see at ABC Corporation, where there is a CEO to whom everyone reports, where processes and job descriptions are well recorded, and where low-level staff have very little decision-making ability. On the other side, organic companies are distinguished by a structure that is more adaptable, with less formalization, decentralization, and a greater degree of employee autonomy than conventional businesses. They have a flatter organizational structure, fewer defined roles and duties, and a greater propensity for adaptability and responsiveness to change. In conclusion, ABC Corporation has a more mechanistic structure because it has a high degree of formalization, centralization, and specialized roles and responsibilities. This is consistent with the stable environment where changes occur slowly and product categories do not differ significantly over time. In addition, the structure is also consistent with the roles and responsibilities that are consistent with the stable environment.
