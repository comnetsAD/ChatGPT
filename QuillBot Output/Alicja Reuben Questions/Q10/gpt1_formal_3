According to the information supplied, ABC Corporation looks to have a more mechanical organizational structure. A mechanistic organization has clear lines of power and a structured structure and is extremely centralized. It is characterized by a high level of formalization, with rigid rules and procedures governing employee conduct. It is also characterized by a distinct division of work and a high degree of employee specialization. There is a clear structure within ABC Corporation, with a CEO at the top and a few managers reporting to the CEO. Low-level personnel have little decision-making power, and the company's processes and job descriptions are exhaustively recorded. This implies that the organization is highly centralized and adheres to tight policies and procedures. It also implies that the organization is specialized and has a distinct division of work. In contrast, an organic organization has a flatter hierarchy and a more flexible structure and is more decentralized. It has a high level of autonomy and a low level of formalization. In addition, it is characterized by a high level of cross-functional communication and a more agile decision-making process. Based on the facts provided, ABC Corporation is more mechanical than organic. A mechanistic organization may be useful in a stable environment because it permits clear lines of authority, defined processes, and efficient utilization of resources.
