According to the available data, ABC Corp. has a more mechanized organizational structure. When an organization is highly mechanistic, it is highly formalized, very centralized, and highly specialized. There is a distinct line of command with established positions and responsibilities. This is clearly seen at ABC Corp., where all workers report directly to the CEO, where there are detailed processes and job descriptions, and where lower-level employees have little autonomy. In contrast, organic companies have a less rigid structure, are more decentralized, and offer employees greater discretion and independence. There is less rigidity in positions and tasks, and there is less of a hierarchical structure. Conclusion ABC Corporation has a more mechanical structure due to its high degree of formalization, centralization, and specialized roles and duties; this is in line with the stable environment where changes occur slowly and product categories do not vary considerably over time.
