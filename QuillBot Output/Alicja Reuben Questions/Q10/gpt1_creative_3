In light of the available data, it would seem that ABC Corp. has a more mechanical approach to its internal structure. A mechanistic organization is one in which power is concentrated in a small number of hands and everyone follows set procedures. Workplace conduct is strictly regulated by a set of rules and regulations in this setting. Moreover, it is characterized by a distinct separation of duties and a high level of expertise among staff members. There is a distinct chain of command at ABC Corporation, with the CEO at the top and a small group of managers under him. Because of the company's strict adherence to written processes and set job descriptions, lower-level workers have very little autonomy. This may indicate that the organization is extremely regulated and regimented. Having a clear division of work and specialized employees are other indicators of a well-run business. A more organic organization, on the other hand, is one that is less hierarchical and more fluid in its structure. It is characterized by a low level of formalization and a high level of independence. There is a lot of cooperation across departments, and decisions are made more quickly. Based on this evidence, ABC Corporation seems to be more mechanical than biological. When conditions are predictable, a mechanistic organizational structure may be useful because it facilitates established chain of command, standardization of processes, and optimal allocation of resources.
