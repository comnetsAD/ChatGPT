According to the information presented, ABC Corporation's organizational structure is more mechanical. A high degree of formalization, centralization, and specialization are defining characteristics of mechanistic organizations. They have a hierarchical structure with well defined positions and duties, as well as a distinct chain of command. This is obvious in ABC Corporation, which has a CEO to whom all workers report, well-documented processes and job descriptions, and no decision-making power for lower-level staff. Organic organizations, on the other hand, have a more flexible structure, with less formalization, decentralization, and more employee autonomy. They are often more flexible and sensitive to change, having a flatter organizational structure and fewer restrictive roles and duties. In conclusion, ABC Corporation has a more mechanistic structure due to its high degree of formalization, centralization, and specialized roles and responsibilities, which is consistent with the stable environment in which changes occur slowly and product categories do not vary significantly over time.
