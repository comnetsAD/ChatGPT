According to the information given, ABC Corp.'s organizational structure is more mechanical. High levels of formalization, centralization, and specialization define mechanistic organizations. They follow a clear line of command, have a defined hierarchy, and specified duties and responsibilities. This is seen in ABC Corp., which has a CEO to whom everyone reports, extremely detailed policies and job descriptions, and little opportunities for low-level workers to make decisions. Organic organizations, on the other hand, stand out for their flexible structures, less formalization, more decentralization, and greater levels of employee autonomy. With a flat structure and fewer strict duties and responsibilities, they have a tendency to be more flexible and receptive to change. As a result of its high level of formalization, centralization, and specialized roles and duties, ABC Corp. has a more mechanical structure that is compatible with the stable environment where changes happen gradually and product categories do not vary noticeably over time.
