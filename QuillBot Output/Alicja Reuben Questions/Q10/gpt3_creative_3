Is ABC more mechanical or organic in your opinion? What we know so far suggests that ABC Corp. has a more mechanical organizational structure and approach to management. When an organization is highly mechanistic, it is highly formalized, very centralized, and highly specialized. They are often well organized and have a clear chain of command, with most of the decision-making taking place at the very top. Additionally, they often have a specified set of policies and procedures that workers must adhere to, and their job descriptions are usually rigid. Employees lower on the totem pole at ABC Corp. have little say in corporate matters and report to the CEO through a small group of middle management. Each employee's role inside the organization has been meticulously outlined in detail and will not change. These features are typical of a mechanized structure in the workplace. Organic organizations, on the other hand, include a more fluid, decentralized structure in which authority over making decisions is dispersed between a wider group of employees. The focus is less on rigid rules and processes and more on employees' ability to think on their own and come up with solutions. They can easily adjust to new situations and take a more open-minded approach to addressing problems. ABC Corp. does not fit the bill since it lacks these qualities. This makes it seem less organic and more mechanical.
