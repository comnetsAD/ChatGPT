ABC Corp.'s organizational structure seems to be more mechanical based on the information presented. Mechanistic organizations exhibit high levels of formalization, centralization, and specialization. They have a structured hierarchy with specified positions and duties, as well as a clear line of command. ABC Corp. exemplifies this, with a CEO to whom everyone reports, carefully written processes and job descriptions, and no decision-making ability for lower-level staff. Organic organizations, on the other hand, have a more flexible structure, with less formalization, decentralization, and a larger degree of employee autonomy. With a flat hierarchy and fewer fixed roles and duties, they are more flexible and responsive to change. Finally, ABC Corp. has a more mechanistic structure due to a high degree of formalization, centralization, and specialized roles and duties, which is compatible with the stable environment where changes occur slowly and product categories do not vary considerably over time.
