Company structureâ€”best? what's According to the facts presented, ABC Corp. has a stable environment, well-defined product line, predictable client base, and few staff. These variables suggest a functional organization for the firm. Production, marketing, and finance are functional areas. This structure works effectively in stable circumstances when each employee has a clear set of duties. The CEO would oversee the corporation, while each manager oversaw a specialized role (e.g. production manager, marketing manager, finance manager). Low-level workers have distinct duties and responsibilities but minimal decision-making power. The functional organization matches the company's well-documented processes and job descriptions. This structure is simple, efficient, and cost-effective, particularly for small companies with steady products and client bases.
