Based on the available data, it seems that a functional structure would benefit ABC Corporation the most. Organizations that function in predictable settings with clearly defined roles and responsibilities and a need for specialized skills benefit most from this structure. Employees in a functional structure are organized into departments like production, marketing, and finance, each of which specializes in a certain aspect of the business. A few managers would report directly to the CEO, who would serve as the company's top management. Managers at this level would be in charge of ensuring the smooth operation of the business' various departments. The lower-level staff would not be involved in major policy decisions but would be responsible for carrying them out as laid forth by upper management. ABC Corp. fits the bill for this organizational setup since it functions in a predictable market, has a distinct product offering, and sells almost exclusively to other companies. With just twenty people, this firm would be quite manageable, and the CEO would have no trouble keeping in touch with everyone.
