Based on the available information, it seems that a hierarchical structure would be most suitable for ABC Corp. This form of organization is distinguished by a distinct chain of command and division of work. It is suitable for workplaces with minimal changes and a clear separation of duties and responsibilities. The CEO would have the highest position in the organization, with managers reporting to them. The supervisors would then oversee the lower-level staff. The low-level personnel would have limited decision-making ability and would be responsible for completing the assigned duties in accordance with the defined processes. Given that the firm focuses mostly on B2B and has a limited number of workers, a flat organizational structure with fewer supervisors may also be appropriate, since it facilitates a more efficient decision-making process and speedier communication among employees. This structure would also make it simple for the corporation to adjust to its slow-changing, predictable market. In addition, the company's well-documented procedures and permanent job descriptions foster defined roles, duties, and decision-making processes, which are advantageous in a stable workplace.
