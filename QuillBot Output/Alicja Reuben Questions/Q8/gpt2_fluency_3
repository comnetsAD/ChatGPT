Based on the information supplied, a hierarchical structure seems to be the best fit for ABC Corp. This organization is distinguished by a distinct chain of command and a distinct division of work. It is best suited to stable workplaces with little changes and a defined separation of jobs and responsibilities. The CEO would be at the top of the organizational chart, with managers reporting to them. Managers would thereafter be in charge of managing lower-level staff. Low-level personnel would have minimal decision-making ability and would be accountable for carrying out the duties allocated to them in accordance with the established processes. Given that the firm predominantly works in B2B and has a limited number of workers, a flat organizational structure with fewer supervisors may also be a suitable match, allowing for more efficient decision-making and quicker communication among employees. This structure would also make it simple for the corporation to adjust to its slow-changing and predictable market. Furthermore, the company's well-documented procedures and established job descriptions correlate well with a hierarchical structure since they foster defined roles, duties, and decision-making processes, which is advantageous in a stable atmosphere.
