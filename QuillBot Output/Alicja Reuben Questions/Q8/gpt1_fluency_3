Based on the facts supplied, it seems that a functional structure would be the optimum structure for ABC Corp. This structure is best suited for firms that operate in stable contexts with clear, well-defined roles and duties and where specialized knowledge is required. Employees are placed together in a functional structure depending on their area of competence, such as manufacturing, marketing, or finance. The CEO would be the top management, with a few managers reporting to them directly. These managers would be in charge of managing the company's many functional sectors. Low-level personnel would have minimal decision-making ability and would be largely responsible for carrying out the processes specified by upper management. This structure would be ideal for ABC Corp. since it works in a stable environment, has a distinct product line, and mostly sells to other firms. With just 20 people, the firm would be simple to run and would provide for clear lines of communication between the CEO and the rest of the organization.
