Which organizational structure is most suitable for the company? According to the material that has been presented, it would seem that ABC Corporation maintains a steady environment with a well defined product line, a client base that can be anticipated, and a limited number of workers. In light of these considerations, it seems probable that the corporation would benefit most from adopting a functional organizational structure. Employees in an organization with a functional structure are organized into groups according to the functional areas in which they work, such as production, marketing, and finance. This structure works very effectively in consistent workplaces in which there is a distinct division of labor and a well-defined set of responsibilities assigned to each employee. In this scenario, the Chief Executive Officer would be responsible for the overall operations of the organization, while each manager would be in charge of a certain functional area (e.g. production manager, marketing manager, finance manager). Although they would have little decision-making ability, lower-level workers would have their duties and responsibilities clearly outlined for them. The extensively documented processes and set job descriptions of the corporation would be compatible with the functional structure of the organization. This structure is simple to administer, it is successful, and it is cost-effective, particularly for smaller firms that operate in a consistent environment, one in which the product and the client base do not see substantial changes over the course of time.
