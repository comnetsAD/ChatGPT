According to the presented data, a hierarchical organizational structure is most suited for ABC Corp. Such an organization has a distinct line of authority and a well-defined set of responsibilities. It works best in consistent settings with little turnover and well-defined roles and duties. The chief executive officer would be at the very top of the organizational chart, with lower-level managers reporting to them. Managers would subsequently be accountable for overseeing lower-level workers. Low-level workers would be expected to follow defined protocols for completing their work without much input from higher-ups. Since the firm focuses on business-to-business sales and has a relatively small workforce, a flat organizational structure with fewer supervisors might work well by streamlining decision-making and improving communication inside the company. Furthermore, the company's slow-changing, stable market would be able to readily accommodate this structure. Organizational stability is enhanced by the company's well-documented procedures and consistent job descriptions, both of which foster transparency in regards to roles, duties, and decision-making.
