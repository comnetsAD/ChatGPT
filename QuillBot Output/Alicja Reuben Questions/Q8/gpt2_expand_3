According to the information that has been presented, it would seem that the organizational structure that would work best for ABC Corporation would be a hierarchical one. This particular kind of organization is distinguished by having a distinct chain of command as well as a distinct division of work. It functions best in consistent settings with few if any shifts and a well-defined separation of roles and duties for all parties involved. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) would sit atop the organizational chart, with managers behind them in the chain of command. The lower-level workers would then report to the managers, who would be responsible for their supervision. The low-level workers would not have much ability to make decisions, but they would be accountable for carrying out the duties that have been allocated to them in accordance with the protocols that have been established. Given that the majority of the company's business is conducted with B2B clients and that it employs a relatively small number of people, it is possible that a hierarchical structure that is more horizontal in nature and that has fewer managers would be a good fit for the business. Such a structure facilitates a decision-making process that is both more effective and more quickly communicated throughout the workforce. This structure would also make it simple to adjust to the slow-changing and very predictable market that the firm operates in. Additionally, the company's carefully defined procedures and established job descriptions work well with a hierarchical structure. This is because they foster clear roles, duties, and decision-making processes, which is useful in an atmosphere that is relatively stable.
