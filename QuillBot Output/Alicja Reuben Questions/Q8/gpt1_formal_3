Given the available facts, it seems that the optimal structure for ABC Corporation would be a functional one. This form of structure is ideal for firms that operate in stable contexts with well defined roles and responsibilities, and where specialized knowledge is required. In a functional structure, personnel are organized according to their respective areas of specialization, such as manufacturing, marketing, or finance. A few managers would report directly to the CEO, who would serve as the top management. These managers would be responsible for supervising the company's many functional sectors. Low-level personnel would have little decision-making capacity and would be largely responsible for carrying out the processes specified by senior management. This structure would be suitable for ABC Corporation since it works in a stable environment, has a distinct product line, and largely sells to other companies. The modest size of the firm, with just twenty people, would also make it easier to administer and facilitate clear communication between the CEO and the rest of the organization.
