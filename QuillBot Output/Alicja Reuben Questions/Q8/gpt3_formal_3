What is the suggested structure for the business? According to the available facts, ABC Corporation looks to function in a stable environment with a well-defined product line, a predictable client base, and a modest workforce. Given these characteristics, a functional organizational structure would likely be the most suitable for the organization. A functional structure organizes personnel according to their respective functional areas, such as manufacturing, marketing, and finance. This structure is optimal for stable situations in which there is a clear division of labor and a well-defined set of responsibilities for each employee. In this situation, the CEO would have overall accountability for the organization, but each manager would be responsible for a particular functional area (e.g. production manager, marketing manager, finance manager). Low-level workers would have little decision-making ability, but their duties and responsibilities would be clearly defined. The extensively documented processes and established job descriptions of the organization would be consistent with the functional structure. This structure is simple to operate, efficient, and cost-effective, particularly for small firms with a stable environment in which the product and client base do not vary much over time.
