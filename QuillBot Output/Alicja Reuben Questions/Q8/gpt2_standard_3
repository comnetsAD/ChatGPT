According to the evidence given, it would seem that ABC Corp. would benefit best from a hierarchical organization. This kind of organization is distinguished by a distinct chain of command and a distinct division of tasks. It works well in situations that are stable, have minimal changes, and clearly define roles and duties. The managers would report to the CEO, who would be at the top of the organization. The management of the lower-level personnel would subsequently fall to the managers. Low-level personnel would have limited decision-making power and be in charge of doing the duties allocated to them in accordance with the established processes. Given the company's modest size and focus on business-to-business transactions, a flat organizational structure with fewer managers could also be a suitable match since it promotes quicker employee communication and more effective decision-making. This organizational structure would also make it simple to adjust to the business's predictable and slowly changing market. Additionally, the organization's rigid job descriptions and thoroughly documented processes fit well with a hierarchical structure since they support distinct roles, responsibilities, and decision-making processes, which is advantageous in a stable environment.
