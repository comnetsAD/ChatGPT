According to the information, ABC Corp. should have a hierarchical organization. This organization has a distinct hierarchy and division of work. It works best in stable, well-defined workplaces. Managers report to the CEO. Managers would supervise low-level workers. Low-level workers would follow processes and have minimal decision-making power. Since the firm focuses on B2B and has a small staff, a flat organizational structure with fewer supervisors may be a suitable match for speedier decision-making and communication. This structure would make it easier to adjust to the company's slow-changing and predictable market. In a stable environment, the company's well-documented procedures and job descriptions support defined roles, responsibilities, and decision-making processes, which fit well with a hierarchical structure.
