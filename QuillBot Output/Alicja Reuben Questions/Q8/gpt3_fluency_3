What is the company's preferred structure? ABC Corp. looks to function in a stable environment with a well-defined product line, predictable client base, and a modest number of workers, based on the information presented. Given these considerations, a functional organization is most certainly the best option for the firm. A functional structure organizes personnel according to their functional area, such as manufacturing, marketing, or finance. This structure works effectively in stable situations with a clear division of labor and a well-defined set of duties for each employee. In this situation, the CEO would be in control of the whole firm, with each manager in charge of a certain functional area (e.g. production manager, marketing manager, finance manager). Low-level workers would have minimal decision-making power, but their duties and responsibilities would be clearly defined. The functional organization would be aligned with the company's extensively documented processes and established job descriptions. This structure is simple to administer, efficient, and cost-effective, particularly for small firms in a stable environment with a consistent product and client base.
