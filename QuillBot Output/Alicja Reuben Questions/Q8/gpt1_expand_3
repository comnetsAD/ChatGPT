Given the information that has been presented, it would seem that the functional structure would be the most appropriate one for ABC Corporation. Organizations that function in predictable settings, have roles and responsibilities that are crystal clear and well-defined, and have a need for specialized knowledge are the most ideal candidates for this kind of organizational structure. Employees are organized into teams within a functional structure according to the functional areas in which they specialize, such as production, marketing, or finance, for example. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) would serve as the top management, and a select group of managers would report directly to the CEO. These managers would be in charge of ensuring that each of the company's functional divisions is being properly monitored. The lower-level personnel would have very limited ability to make decisions and would mainly be accountable for carrying out the protocols that have been set by the higher-level management. ABC Corporation works in a stable environment, has a distinct product line, and makes the majority of its sales to other firms, therefore this structure would be an excellent fit for the company. The relatively modest size of the firm, which consists of just twenty workers, would make it simple to administer and would provide open lines of communication between the chief executive officer and the rest of the organization.
