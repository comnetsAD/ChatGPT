Should we adopt a certain corporate structure, if so, what is it? From what we can see, ABC Corp. has a steady business climate, a clear product offering, a reliable clientele, and a manageable workforce size. In light of these considerations, a functional organizational structure seems like the best fit for the firm. Staff members in a functional structure are organized into teams based on their specific roles, such as production, marketing, or finance. This setup works well in steady settings with clearly defined roles and responsibilities. The CEO would be in charge of the business as a whole, while other managers would be responsible for different parts of the operation (e.g. production manager, marketing manager, finance manager). Employees at lower levels would have little discretion but would know exactly what they should be doing. The functional organization would be consistent with the company's well-documented processes and stable job descriptions. For small businesses in a somewhat stable market, where the nature of the product and the clientele do not fluctuate wildly over time, this organizational setup may be particularly advantageous because of its manageability, efficiency, and low cost.
