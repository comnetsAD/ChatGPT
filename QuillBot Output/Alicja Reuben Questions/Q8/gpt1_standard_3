According to the facts given, it would seem that a functional structure would be the best option for ABC Corp. Organizations that function in stable contexts with distinct, well-defined roles and activities and where specialized knowledge is required are best suited for this sort of structure. Employees are organized in functional structures according to their areas of specialization, such as manufacturing, marketing, or finance. A few managers would report directly to the CEO, who would serve as the organization's top management. These managers would be in charge of directing the company's many functional divisions. Low-level staff would mostly be in charge of carrying out the policies that have been set by the top management and would have minimal power to make decisions. Given that ABC Corp. sells mostly to other companies, works in a stable economy, and has a distinct product line, this structure would be a good fit for the company. With just 20 workers, the business would also be simple to operate and provide open lines of communication between the CEO and the rest of the firm.
