What is the best organizational structure for the business? Considering the data available, it would seem that ABC Corp. works in a stable environment with a well defined product line, a steady client base, and a modest staff. Given these elements, the firm would most likely benefit from a functional structure. Employees are organized into functional groups, such as manufacturing, marketing, and finance, in a functional structure. This organizational structure works best in stable workplaces with a distinct division of labor and well defined job descriptions for each employee. In this scenario, the CEO would be in control of the whole firm while each manager would be in charge of a certain functional area (e.g. production manager, marketing manager, finance manager). Although low-level workers would have little decision-making power, their duties and responsibilities would be well-defined. The functional structure would be in line with the organization's well documented processes and set job descriptions. Particularly for small businesses with a stable environment, where the product and client base do not vary dramatically over time, this structure is simple to administer, effective, and economical.
