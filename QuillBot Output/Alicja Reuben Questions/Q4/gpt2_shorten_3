Fostering a culture of more cooperation may also be accomplished by encouraging workers to work together more effectively as a team. The organization has the ability to devise scenarios in which workers are given the chance to collaborate on projects and hone their abilities in a group setting. This may be accomplished via the use of cross-functional teams, team-building exercises, and several other types of cooperation. The organization may assist to establish a culture of cooperation among its workers by emphasizing the importance of collaboration and encouraging its employees to work together toward the accomplishment of shared objectives.

The organization has the ability to institute a recognition program that will reward workers for cooperating with one another and for reaching goals as a group. This may be accomplished via the use of incentives like as bonuses and promotions, as well as other types of recognition.
