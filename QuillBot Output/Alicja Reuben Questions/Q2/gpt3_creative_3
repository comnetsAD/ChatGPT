Conducting a correlational analysis between the Big Five personality characteristics and leadership effectiveness is one approach. The following is one possible approach to the design of such a study: Participants should ideally have leadership roles in their present workplaces, such as managers or team leaders. Distribute a Big Five personality scale, such as the NEO-PI-R, to each participant. The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) and the Leadership Practices Inventory are two examples of accurate and trustworthy leadership evaluation tools that may be used to gather information about the participants' leadership abilities (LPI). Use a statistical program to find a relationship between the Big 5 score and the leadership effectiveness score. Give an explanation for the findings, and detail the nature and direction of any noteworthy associations. Keep in mind that this study design simply enables you to demonstrate a link between the variables; if you want to show causality, you'll need to undertake further research, like a causal study.
