A research on the Big 5 personality characteristics and leadership may utilize a sample of leaders from different businesses and have them take a personality assessment (e.g., the NEO-PI-R). The research may then compare Big 5 characteristic scores to leadership effectiveness (e.g., ratings from subordinates, peers, and superiors). To account for confounding influences, the research may additionally include age, gender, tenure, and education. Another method is to randomly allocate a group sample to leader or follower positions. Measure participants' Big 5 attributes before and after the group work and compare leaders and followers' personality changes. This approach provides causal inference regarding leadership position and personality. Combining these methodologies allows you to study the Big 5 qualities, leadership position, and leadership effectiveness.
