A correlational research design is one approach that might be used in the process of designing a study to investigate the connection between the Big Five personality characteristics and leadership. The research might start by selecting a group of people who are already in leadership roles, such as managers or supervisors, to serve as participants in the study. After that, these individuals would finish an assessment of the Big Five personality characteristics, such the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO PI-R). The NEO PI-R is a commonly used and scientifically confirmed assessment of the five characteristics that make up a person's personality. After that, an instrument for leadership analysis, such as the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, would be used to gather information on the participants' leadership approaches, performance levels, and overall effectiveness (MLQ). The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) is a leadership assessment tool that has been verified and is used extensively. In the last step of the research, the data will be analyzed to see whether or not there is a link between the participants' scores on the MLQ and their scores on the Big 5 personality characteristics. The findings of this study have the potential to provide light on the degree to which the Big Five personality characteristics are connected to leadership style, performance, and efficiency. It is essential to emphasize that the research design in question is just a correlational one and not a causal one, and it is essential that this point be made clear in the conclusion of the investigation.
