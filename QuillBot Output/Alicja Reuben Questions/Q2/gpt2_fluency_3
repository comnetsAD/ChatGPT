Using a sample of leaders from diverse companies and having them take a personality assessment assessing the Big 5 attributes is one method to construct a research on the Big 5 personality traits and leadership (e.g., the NEO-PI-R). The research may then look at the relationship between each of the Big 5 attributes and measures of leadership effectiveness (e.g., ratings from subordinates, peers, and superiors). In addition, to account for any confounding effects, the research might incorporate control variables such as age, gender, tenure, and education level. Another approach would be to take a random sample of people and assign them to leader or follower positions in a group environment. Then, compare the changes in personality between leaders and followers by measuring the participants' Big 5 qualities before and after the group work. This approach enables a causal conclusion regarding the impact of leadership on personality. It is also feasible to combine the two methodologies described above and look at the link between the Big 5 qualities, leadership position, and leadership effectiveness.
