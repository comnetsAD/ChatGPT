Using a sample of leaders from different businesses and having them take a personality assessment assessing the Big 5 attributes is one method to construct a research on the Big 5 personality traits and leadership (e.g., the NEO-PI-R). The research may then investigate the relationship between Big Five characteristic scores and measures of leadership effectiveness (e.g., ratings from subordinates, peers, and superiors). To account for any possible confounding effects, the research might additionally incorporate control factors such as age, gender, tenure, and education level. Another method would be to randomly assign a sample of people to leadership or follower positions in a group environment. Then, assess the Big 5 characteristics of the participants before and after the group work, and compare the personality changes between leaders and followers. This approach permits a causal conclusion about the relationship between leadership position and personality. It is also conceivable to combine the two methodologies outlined above in order to examine the link between the Big 5 attributes, leadership position, and leadership effectiveness.
