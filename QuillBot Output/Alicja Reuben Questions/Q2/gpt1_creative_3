A correlational research approach may be used to examine how the Big Five personality characteristics relate to leadership. Researchers might kick off their investigation by canvassing existing managers and supervisors for a representative sample to interview. Next, these people would fill out a Big Five personality inventory like the NEO PI-R to get an accurate picture of themselves (NEO PI-R). The NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO PI-R) is a tried-and-true method for gauging the big five personality characteristics. After that, a leadership evaluation instrument like the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire would be used to gather information about the participants' leadership styles, performances, and efficacies (MLQ). The MLQ has been shown to be reliable and valid as a measure of both transformational and transactional leadership. The study's last step would include data analysis to check for a connection between the MLQ and the Big Five personality characteristics. This investigation may provide light on the relationship between the Big Five personality characteristics and leadership qualities including style, performance, and effectiveness. It would be helpful to emphasize in the study's conclusion that the design can only establish a correlation and not a causal relationship.
