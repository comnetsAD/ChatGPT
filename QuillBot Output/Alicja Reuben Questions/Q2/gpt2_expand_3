Utilizing a sample of leaders from a variety of businesses and having those leaders take a personality test that measures the Big 5 attributes is one strategy for doing a research on the relationship between the Big 5 personality traits and leadership (e.g., the NEO-PI-R). After that, the research may investigate the degree to which one's scores on each of the Big Five attributes correspond to one's level of leadership effectiveness (e.g., ratings from subordinates, peers, and superiors). In addition, the research may also use control variables in the form of age, gender, length of service, and level of education in order to account for the possibility of confounding effects. Utilizing a sample of people and then arbitrarily placing them in either a leadership or follower position within the context of the group is yet another method. The next step is to assess the Big 5 characteristics of the participants both before and after the group activity, and then evaluate the differences in personality development between leaders and followers. This approach makes it possible to draw a causal conclusion regarding the impact that being in a leadership post has on one's personality. It is also conceivable to combine the two methodologies described above in order to explore the link that exists between the Big 5 personality characteristics, the leadership position, and the efficacy of leadership.
