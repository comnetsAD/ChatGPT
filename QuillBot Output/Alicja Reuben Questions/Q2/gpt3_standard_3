A correlational research is one method of examining the connection between the Big 5 personality characteristics and leadership. An example of how such a research may be structured is as follows: Select a group of participants who are team captains or managers who are presently in leadership roles. Give each participant a Big 5 personality characteristic assessment, such as the NEO-PI-R. Utilize a trustworthy and valid leadership assessment instrument, such as the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) or the Leadership Practices Inventory, to gather information on the degree to which participants are successful leaders (LPI). Utilizing a statistical software program, compare the Big 5 score to the leadership effectiveness score. Report the findings' interpretation and any significant associations that were discovered, along with their strength and direction. It is crucial to remember that correlation does not imply causation. This study design merely allows for the establishment of relationships between the variables; causality must be established by further research, such as a causal study.
