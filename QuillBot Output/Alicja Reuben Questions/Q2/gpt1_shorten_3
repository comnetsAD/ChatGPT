A correlational study may examine the Big 5 personality qualities and leadership. The investigation might start by hiring managers and supervisors. Participants then took a Big 5 personality test like the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO PI-R). The NEO PI-R measures five personality characteristics. The Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire would be used to analyze participants' leadership style, performance, and effectiveness (MLQ). The MLQ measures transformative and transactional leadership. Finally, the research would explore the association between participants' Big 5 personality characteristics and MLQ results. This investigation may reveal how Big 5 personality characteristics affect leadership style, performance, and effectiveness. In the research's conclusion, it should be noted that this design is just a correlational study.
