Using a sample of leaders from diverse businesses and having them take a personality assessment assessing the Big 5 attributes is one method to construct a research on the relationship between the Big 5 personality traits and leadership (e.g., the NEO-PI-R). The research may then look at the relationship between the Big 5 characteristic scores and leadership effectiveness metrics (e.g., ratings from subordinates, peers, and superiors). In order to account for any possible confounding effects, the research might additionally include control variables like age, gender, tenure, and education level. Another approach would be to employ a sample of people and assign them at random to leader or follower positions within a group. Then, compare the personality changes between leaders and followers by measuring the participants' Big 5 attributes before and after the group work. With this approach, it is possible to draw a causal relationship between leadership position and personality. It is also feasible to look at the connection between the Big 5 qualities, the leadership position, and leadership effectiveness by combining the two aforementioned methodologies.
