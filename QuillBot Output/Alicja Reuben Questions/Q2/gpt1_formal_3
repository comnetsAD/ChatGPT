A correlational research methodology may be used to examine the link between the Big 5 personality characteristics and leadership. The research might begin by collecting a representative sample of existing leaders, such as managers and supervisors. Then, these individuals would complete an assessment of the Big Five personality characteristics, such as the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO PI-R). The NEO PI-R is a commonly used and validated instrument for measuring the five personality characteristics. Using a leadership evaluation instrument such as the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, the research would next gather data on the participants' leadership style, performance, and efficacy (MLQ). The MLQ is a commonly used and validated instrument for measuring transformational and transactional leadership. The research would conclude with an examination of the link between the individuals' scores on the Big Five personality characteristics and their MLQ scores. The findings of this study may provide light on the relationship between the Big 5 personality characteristics and leadership style, performance, and effectiveness. It is vital to emphasize that this design is a correlational research and not a causal one, and the result of the study should reflect this.
