A correlational research is one method for investigating the link between the Big 5 personality characteristics and leadership. An example of how such a research may be constructed is as follows: Obtain a sample of participants who are presently in positions of leadership, such as managers or team leaders. All participants should be given a Big 5 personality characteristic assessment, such as the NEO-PI-R. Using a credible and reliable leadership assessment instrument, such as the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) or the Leadership Practices Inventory, collect data on participants' leadership effectiveness (LPI). Using a statistical software application, correlate the Big 5 score with the leadership effectiveness score. Interpret the findings and describe the magnitude and direction of any significant associations discovered. It is crucial to note that correlation does not show causation; this study design merely allows for the establishment of a link between the variables, and more research, such as a causal study, is required to demonstrate causality.
