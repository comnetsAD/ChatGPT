A correlational research design is one method for designing a study on the link between the Big 5 personality characteristics and leadership. The research might begin by recruiting volunteers who are already in positions of leadership, such as managers or supervisors. These individuals would subsequently complete a Big 5 personality characteristic assessment, such as the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised (NEO PI-R). The NEO PI-R is a widely used and validated personality characteristic test. Following that, data on the participants' leadership style, performance, and effectiveness would be collected using a leadership evaluation instrument such as the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ). The MLQ is a popular and well-validated assessment of transformational and transactional leadership. Finally, the data would be analyzed to determine the relationship between the individuals' Big 5 personality characteristics and their MLQ scores. The findings of this study might provide light on how the Big 5 personality characteristics connect to leadership style, performance, and effectiveness. It is vital to highlight that this design is merely a correlation research and not a causation study, and this should be noted in the study's conclusion.
