A correlational study is one method that might be used to investigate the link between the Big 5 personality qualities and leadership. Another method would be to use experimental research. The following is an illustration of one potential layout for such an investigation: Collect a representative sample of participants who are already serving in leadership roles, such as managers or members of the leadership team. A measurement of the Big Five personality characteristics, such as the NEO-PI-R, should be given to each participant in the study. Collect information on the efficacy of the participants' leadership by using a leadership assessment instrument that is both valid and reliable, such as the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) or the Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI). Applying a statistical software tool, establish a correlation between the scores obtained on the Big 5 assessment and the scores obtained on the leadership effectiveness measure. Interpret the findings and indicate both the magnitude and the nature of any significant correlations that are discovered. This design of the study only permits the establishment of a relationship between the variables, and it is important to conduct additional research, such as a causal study, to establish causality. It is important to keep in mind that correlation does not prove causation. It is important to keep in mind that correlation does not prove causation.
