Utilizing a correlational research design is one technique to plan a study on the connections between the Big 5 personality characteristics and leadership. A sample of participants who are presently in leadership roles, such as managers or supervisors, might be selected for the research from the outset. Then, using tools like the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised, these individuals would finish a test of the Big 5 personality characteristics (NEO PI-R). A popular and reliable assessment of the five personality characteristics is the NEO PI-R. The research would next use a leadership evaluation instrument, such as the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire, to gather information on the participants' leadership performance, effectiveness, and style (MLQ). A popular and reliable indicator of both transformative and transactional leadership is the MLQ. The research would next conduct a data analysis to look at the relationship between the participants' results on the MLQ and their scores on the Big 5 personality characteristics. The findings of this investigation may provide light on how closely the Big 5 personality characteristics are connected to a leader's performance, effectiveness, and style. In the study's conclusion, it will be crucial to emphasize that this design is merely a correlational analysis and not a causal one.
