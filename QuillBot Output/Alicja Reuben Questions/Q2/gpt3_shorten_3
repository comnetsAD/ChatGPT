Correlational studies may examine the Big 5 personality qualities and leadership. A sample study is: Sample managers and team leaders. Give everyone a Big 5 personality test like the NEO-PI-R. Use the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) or Leadership Practices Inventory to measure participants' leadership skills (LPI). Using statistical tools, correlate Big 5 and leadership effectiveness ratings. Interpret and report significant correlations. Correlation does not indicate causation; it just establishes a link between variables. To prove causality, a causal investigation must be conducted.
