Studying the relationship between the Big Five and leadership might be accomplished in a number of ways. One approach would be to employ a sample of executives from different businesses and have them take a personality evaluation (e.g., the NEO-PI-R). The research may then compare participants' Big Five characteristic scores to measures of leadership performance (e.g., ratings from subordinates, peers, and superiors). Age, gender, employment status, and level of education are all examples of control variables that may be included in a research to account for any confounding factors. Alternately, one might employ a representative sample and arbitrarily divide the group's members into a leader and a follower. Then, evaluate the leaders and followers in terms of changes to their Big 5 attributes before and after the group work. This setup makes it possible to draw a direct link between holding a leadership position and one's character traits. The Big Five, leadership roles, and leadership efficacy may all be studied by combining the two techniques described above.
