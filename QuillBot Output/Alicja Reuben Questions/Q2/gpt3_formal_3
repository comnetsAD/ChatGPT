A correlational research might be used to examine the link between the Big 5 personality characteristics and leadership. This is an example of how such a research may be designed: Recruit a sample of participants who presently hold positions of leadership, such as managers or team leaders. All participants should be given a measure of the Big 5 personality characteristics, such as the NEO-PI-R. Collect data on the leadership effectiveness of the participants using a valid and dependable leadership assessment instrument, such as the Multifactor Leadership Questionnaire (MLQ) or the Leadership Practices Inventory (LPI). Using statistical tools, correlate scores on the Big 5 assessment with scores on the leadership effectiveness test. Report the degree and direction of any significant relationships discovered and their interpretation. Noting that correlation does not show causation, this study design just establishes a link between the variables; more research, such as a causal study, must be conducted to demonstrate causality.
