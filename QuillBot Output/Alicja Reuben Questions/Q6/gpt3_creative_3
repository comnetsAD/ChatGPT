There are several ways in which a diverse group may improve decision-making. One way is via the introduction of new ideas and points of view. In addition, it may aid in the fight against prejudice and discrimination. However, variety also has its downsides, such as difficulties in communicating with one another and learning about one another's cultures and experiences. When it comes to solving problems and coming up with new ideas, diverse teams are more likely to succeed in professional and academic settings. It's also likely to help in contexts where a varied population is being serviced, including healthcare and the classroom. On the other hand, when a cohesive unit is essential for mission success or patient safety (as in a military squad or operating room team), a diverse workforce may be less useful.
