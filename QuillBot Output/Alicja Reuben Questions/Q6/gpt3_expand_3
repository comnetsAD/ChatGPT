One of the numerous advantages that diversity can offer to a group or organization is the introduction of new viewpoints and ways of thinking, which may result in improved decision-making that is both creative and efficient. It also has the potential to assist in the reduction of prejudice and bias, as well as the promotion of inclusiveness. On the other side, diversity may also create obstacles such as impediments to communication and a lack of understanding of other cultures and backgrounds. These issues might arise when there is a lack of homogeneity within a group. It is expected that diversity will be most advantageous in settings where problem-solving and creativity play a major role, such as in the context of a commercial or research endeavor. It is also likely to be advantageous in settings in which a varied population is being serviced, such as in healthcare or education, and this includes circumstances where a diverse population is being served. On the other side, variety may not be as useful in settings where it is essential to have a homogenous group for the sake of operational efficiency or safety, such as in a military unit or a surgical team at a hospital.
