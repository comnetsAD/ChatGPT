Diversity may provide numerous good advantages to a group or organization, such as promoting creativity and invention, helping to develop a culture of inclusion, and bringing a variety of viewpoints and ideas to the table. On the other hand, it may also bring up complications, such as difficulty in communication and the possibility of disputes amongst the various groups. When there is a need for a broad variety of viewpoints and ideas, such as when trying to find a solution to a problem or making a choice, diversity is likely to be of the most use. In circumstances in which a varied group or organization is in a better position to serve a diverse population, it may also be advantageous to do so. On the other side, variety may be of the least use in circumstances in which a homogenous group is required for the completion of a certain job or in which a singular opinion is prioritized above a number of other views. It is also possible that it will be of less use in circumstances in which there is a lack of cultural competence or in which individuals are unwilling to learn from people of diverse backgrounds or to collaborate with those who come from a variety of cultural backgrounds.
