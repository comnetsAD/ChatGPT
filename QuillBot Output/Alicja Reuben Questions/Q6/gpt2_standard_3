In addition to offering a variety of viewpoints and ideas to a group or organization, diversity may also boost creativity and innovation and contribute to the development of an inclusive culture. However, it may also provide disadvantages, such as poor communication and possible confrontations between various groups. When making decisions or addressing problems, for example, or when a variety of viewpoints and views are required, diversity is probably most advantageous. In cases when a varied group or organization is better suited to serve a diverse community, it may also be helpful. However, diversity may not be as helpful when a homogenous group is required for a certain job or when a single opinion is more significant than a variety of views. It could also be less helpful when there is a lack of cultural competence or when people are unwilling to collaborate or learn from others from diverse backgrounds.
