Diversity may boost creativity, innovation, and inclusion by introducing different viewpoints and ideas to a group or organization. However, communication issues and group tensions may arise. Problem-solving and decision-making benefit most from diversity. It may also help a varied group or organization serve a diverse population. Diversity may be least advantageous when a homogenous group is required for a given job or when a single opinion is more significant than a variety of views. In cases of cultural incompetence or unwillingness to learn from or collaborate with others, it may be less useful.
