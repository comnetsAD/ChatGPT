There are several ways in which diversity may improve a group or organization, including by fostering a more open and accepting atmosphere, fostering innovation and creativity, and fostering a higher level of collaboration. However, it is not without its obstacles, such as misunderstandings and even hostilities between various communities. When a variety of thoughts and approaches are required, as in problem-solving or decision-making, diversity is most likely to shine. In addition, it might be helpful when a more representative cross-section of society is being served by the organization. However, when a uniform team is required for an assignment, or when a single viewpoint is valued over others, variety may be less helpful. It may also be less useful when people lack cultural competence and are unwilling to learn from or collaborate with others from various cultural backgrounds.
