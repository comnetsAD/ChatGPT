Many advantages may be gained through diversity, such as introducing diverse viewpoints and ideas to a group or organization, which can lead to more creative and effective decision making. It may also aid in the promotion of inclusion and the reduction of prejudice and bias. Diversity, on the other side, may create difficulties such as communication problems and a lack of understanding of other cultures and origins. Diversity is likely to be most advantageous in settings requiring problem solving and creativity, such as in business or research. It will also be useful in circumstances where a varied population is serviced, such as healthcare or education. In cases when a homogenous group is required for operational efficiency or safety, such as a military unit or a medical surgical team, variety may be less useful.
