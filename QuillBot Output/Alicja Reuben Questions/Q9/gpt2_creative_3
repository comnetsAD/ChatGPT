ABC Corporation is highly standardized and centralized. The processes of ABC Corp. are extremely well documented, and every employee's job description has been meticulously designed and is not subject to change, both of which are examples of high levels of formalization. This is indicative of the company's highly formalized structure. The term "centralization" describes the practice of having a large percentage of a company's power vested in a small number of top-level executives. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of ABC Corporation is the company's top executive. Workers lower on the corporate food chain have little say in major business decisions. It's possible that the company's high degree of formalization and centralization may be attributed to its modest size, the relative stability of the industry, the nature of the product offered to other firms, and the company's central location. The company's operations may run more smoothly and consistently if there is a defined chain of command and a simple method for making decisions.
