The degree of formalization and centralization at ABC Corporation is rather high. The amount of formalization in an organization is measured by the degree to which its processes are standardized and recorded. ABC Corporation's procedures are very well documented, and the job descriptions of all of its employees have been meticulously prepared and will not change. This suggests that the firm maintains a very high degree of formalization. The degree to which the power to make decisions is positioned at the very top of an organization is referred to as its level of centralization. The Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of ABC Corporation is the top authority in the company, and all employees report to him via a select group of managers. There is a significant degree of centralization in the organization, as seen by the fact that low-level workers have very little decision-making power. There is a high degree of formalization and centralization in the company, which may have been caused by a combination of factors, including the size of the organization, the stability of the external environment, the nature of the product that is sold to other businesses, and the small size of the organization. Because of this, the organization is able to have a distinct chain of command and a simplified decision-making process, both of which may be beneficial in the company's efforts to maintain consistency and efficiency in its operations.
