ABC Corporation is highly standardized and centralized. The level of formalization in an organization is measured by how well-defined roles and responsibilities are written down. There is a high degree of formalization at ABC Corp., as seen by the company's well-documented processes and each employee's well designed and stable job description. The term "centralization" describes the practice of having a large percentage of a company's power vested in a small number of top-level executives. Everyone at ABC Corp. reports to the CEO through a small group of managers, and the regular workers have very little say in the company's day-to-day operations. This points to a very centralized system. To sum up, ABC Corp. has a highly formalized and centralized decision-making process. The company's consistent operations and focus on a single product line certainly contribute to this. Since there are not many people working there and the CEO makes all the major decisions, the firm has tight control over all of its processes.
