ABC Corporation is highly formalized and centralized. Formalization refers to an organization's degree of standardization and documentation, and ABC Corp. has well documented processes, with each employee's job description thoroughly prepared and fixed. This shows that the firm has a high degree of formalization. The degree to which decision-making power is concentrated at the top of an organization is referred to as centralization. The CEO is the ultimate authority of ABC Corp., and everyone reports to him via a few supervisors. Low-level personnel have minimal decision-making power, suggesting that the organization is highly centralized. The company's high degree of formalization and centralization may be attributed to the stability of the environment and the nature of the product offered to other firms, as well as the modest size of the organization. This provides the organization with a clear chain of command and a simplified decision-making process, which may help the company maintain consistency and efficiency in its operations.
