The degree to which a company values and rewards its workers' willingness to take risks and introduce novel concepts is an indicator of its innovative and risk-taking culture. Google is an example of a corporation with this kind of organizational culture. Google is recognized for its risk-taking and creative culture, which encourages workers to spend 20% of their time on "Google Labs" projects, which are effectively free time to work on whatever ideas they have, no matter how out-there. The importance an organization places on being exact, thorough, and precise is one indicator of this dimension. Amazon is a great example of a corporation with a culture that places a premium on using measurements and statistics to make decisions, as well as having stringent requirements for quality and efficiency in all areas of the business. How much a company values performance, productivity, and attaining outcomes above, say, socializing or satisfying process objectives is one measure of outcome orientation. Tesla, with its reputation for laser-like concentration on attaining lofty objectives in a short period of time and its unrelenting pursuit of innovation and advancement, exemplifies this aspect of corporate culture. It's worth noting that organizational culture may take on varying manifestations from firm to company, and even within a single company at various points in time or space.
