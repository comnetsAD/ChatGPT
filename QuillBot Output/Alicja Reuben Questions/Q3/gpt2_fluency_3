Organizational culture has three dimensions: This dimension relates to the degree to which a corporation fosters and rewards innovation as well as taking prudent risks. Google, for example, is renowned for its 20% time policy, in which workers are granted 20% of their work time to pursue initiatives of their own interest. Attention to detail: This dimension relates to the amount of accuracy and completeness expected in a company's work operations. Tesla, for example, focuses attention to detail in its production process to assure high-quality goods. Outcome orientation: This factor relates to how much emphasis a corporation places on accomplishing specified goals and objectives. Amazon is an example of this dimension because of its extreme emphasis on meeting performance objectives and continually enhancing its operations.
