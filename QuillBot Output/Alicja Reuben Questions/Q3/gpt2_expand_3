The following are three aspects that make up an organization's culture: The degree to which a corporation fosters an environment that is creatively rewarding, as well as one that encourages its employees to take calculated risks, is referred to as the "innovation and risk-taking" dimension. One company that exemplifies this aspect is Google. The company is famous for its 20% time policy, according to which workers are allowed to devote 20% of their work time to activities that are of their own choosing. The amount of accuracy and completeness that a corporation expects from its employees in the performance of their jobs is referred to as "attention to detail" in this context. Tesla is a good example of this dimension since it places a strong emphasis on attention to detail throughout its production process in order to guarantee the quality of its finished goods. This aspect of a company's culture refers to the degree to which its leaders and employees are intent on accomplishing the predetermined objectives and aims of the business. Amazon, which is famous for its extreme concentration on reaching performance objectives and continually improving its operations, is a good illustration of this dimension.
