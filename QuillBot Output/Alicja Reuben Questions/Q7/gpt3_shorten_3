Since this task force was formed to confront a crisis, its group processes likely centered on problem-solving and decision-making. The group presumably gathered data, assessed the risks and rewards of numerous possibilities, and made a decision jointly. This method allowed the group to use each member's skills and experience to make well-informed decisions. Brainstorming and group discussion may have yielded more answers and ideas. However, task group losses are possible. The group may have been at danger of groupthink, when members make unreasonable or harmful judgments out of a desire for peace and consensus. This is likely to happen when the group is very cohesive, has a strong perception of invulnerability, and has a high degree of pressure to conform, which may have been the case when the task force had to make swift choices under pressure to manage the crisis. Group polarization, when the group's choices or opinions become more extreme than its members', was also a concern. This may have led the panel to make a hasty or unfavorable choice for the nation. The task force's group methods may have helped with problem-solving and decision-making, but groupthink might have hampered its decision-making.
