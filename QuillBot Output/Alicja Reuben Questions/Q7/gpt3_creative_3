Since this task force was formed to deal with a particular issue, its group procedures probably centered on finding solutions to problems and making important decisions. It's probable that the group collaborated to collect relevant data, weigh the pros and cons of various possibilities, and settle on a course of action. One possible benefit is that the group is better equipped to make decisions based on a comprehensive understanding of all relevant factors, thanks to the contributions of all members. Also, via brainstorming and group debate, the team may have come up with other options on how to proceed. The task group itself, though, may have suffered losses. As a result of trying to please everyone in the group, individuals may end up making judgments that are bad for the group as a whole (known as "groupthink"). This may have happened because the group had to make quick judgments under duress, with the task force being formed to deal with the crisis scenario, both of which are conditions that foster groupthink and conformity. There was also the possibility of group polarization, in which the collective's choices or sentiments became more extreme than those of its individual members. This could have led the group to make a choice that wasn't well-considered or wasn't in the best interest of the nation as a whole. Group procedures inside the task force may have helped with problem-solving and decision-making overall, but there were hazards, such as groupthink, that might have undermined the group's decision-making quality.
