Because this task force was formed to handle a particular crisis scenario, the group processes that occurred inside the task force were most likely focused on problem-solving and decision-making. The group most likely collaborated to acquire information and data, analyze the possible risks and rewards of various choices, and eventually decide how to proceed. One possible benefit of this procedure might be that the group was able to harness each individual member's skills and experience, providing for a well-rounded and educated decision-making process. Furthermore, via brainstorming and group debate, the group may have been able to develop a bigger number of alternative answers and suggestions. However, there is also the possibility of losses inside the work group. One possible disadvantage is that the group was vulnerable to groupthink, a phenomenon in which members of a group make unreasonable or problematic judgments in the pursuit of unity and consensus within the group. This is more likely to happen when the group is very cohesive, has a strong feeling of invulnerability, and is under a lot of pressure to conform, which might have happened because the group had to make quick choices under duress, with the task force formed to deal with the crisis scenario. Furthermore, the group may have been vulnerable to group polarization, a condition in which the group's choices or views become more extreme than the original positions of its individual members. This may have resulted in the committee making a hasty choice that was not in the best interests of the nation as a whole. Overall, although the task force's group procedures were likely advantageous in terms of problem-solving and decision-making, there were also possible hazards, such as groupthink, that might have harmed the group's capacity to make smart judgments.
