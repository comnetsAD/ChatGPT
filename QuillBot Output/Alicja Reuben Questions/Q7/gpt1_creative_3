Members of the group were likely able to learn from one another's experiences and insights, make better judgments by weighing competing factors, and work together to complete a difficult job. But the group also ran the risk of suffering multiple casualties. Groupthink was a major risk for the task force's efficiency. The inability to think critically and make sound decisions may result. The task force was susceptible to groupthink because of a number of variables. The panel was also under the President's deadline to open the economy, which may have caused them to rush to conclusions without fully considering all of their choices. Knowledge, competence, and decision-making were all pooled together, yet the group ran the danger of succumbing to groupthink owing to the intensity of the work at hand and the similarity of its members. It would have been better if the task force had allowed for dissenting opinions and discussion among its members in order to prevent members from falling into the trap of groupthink.
