Numerous benefits and losses would have certainly resulted from the group procedures that took place inside this task force. The group undoubtedly benefited from the sharing of information and experience, the opportunity to make better informed choices via the consideration of many viewpoints, and the ability to complete a complicated work with a feeling of shared responsibility. However, there were a number of possible group losses that may have happened. Groupthink is one of the most significant possible losses that the task team may have endured. Groupthink occurs when members of a group become so dedicated to a specific course of action that they fail to consider alternate viewpoints or possibilities. This may result in poor judgment and a lack of critical thinking. Multiple elements posed a threat of groupthink to the task team. The fact that the group was constituted of persons from the same administration, who may have had similar political ideas and ambitions, is a significant consideration. In addition, the committee was under pressure from the president to make hasty choices in order to open the economy, which might have contributed to a lack of deliberation and a rush to judgment. In conclusion, the group processes that probably occurred inside the task force included a range of benefits and losses. Due to the strain of the work and the homogeneity of the group members, there was a potential of groupthink inside the group. To prevent groupthink, the task committee should have fostered varied viewpoints and critical thinking, as well as discussion and dissent.
