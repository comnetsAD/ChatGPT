President Trump assembled a committee to unlock the U.S. economy, and their group procedures probably included a range of wins and losers. As a result of working together, the group probably saw some benefits, such as: The establishment of a crystal clear objective: The task force's crystal clear and particular objective was to unlock the U.S. economy. Having members of the task group with backgrounds in fields like business, agriculture, and transportation allowed for a more well-rounded examination of potential solutions. The task group consisted of high-ranking government officials, all of whom had the authority to act swiftly and decisively. Many members of the group have probably died, including: The danger of conformity: President Trump assembled a panel of top government officials to handle this issue. Therefore, they may have been vulnerable to groupthink, which occurs when people in a group start to agree with the choices made by the group's leader or the most powerful members. President Trump selected everyone on the task team, so there wasn't a lot of variety among the members. Because of this, there may not have been enough people with varied viewpoints and ideas because of a lack of variety in terms of political opinions, professional backgrounds, and life experiences. In conclusion, the group dynamics of President Trump's task team to unlock the U.S. economy from its confinement were likely a mixed bag. The group knew what it wanted to accomplish, shared knowledge, and made choices swiftly. However, owing to the uniformity of the group and the President's authoritative leadership, they ran the danger of succumbing to groupthink.
