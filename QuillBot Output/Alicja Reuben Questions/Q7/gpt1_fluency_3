This task group's group procedures would have most likely involved a mix of gains and losses. Some of the benefits that are likely to have happened inside the group include the members sharing their knowledge and experience, the capacity to make better informed choices by considering many views, and the ability to complete a complicated work with a feeling of shared responsibility. However, there were other possible losses inside the group that may have happened. Groupthink is one of the most significant possible losses that the task force may have suffered. Groupthink occurs when members of a group become so dedicated to one course of action that they forget to consider alternate viewpoints or possibilities. This may result in bad decisions and a lack of critical thinking. Several factors contributed to the task force's susceptibility to groupthink. One of the most important elements was that the group was made up of people from the same administration who may have same political opinions and goals. Furthermore, the committee was under President Obama's pressure to make speedy judgments in order to open the economy, which might have resulted in a rush to judgment and a failure to examine other choices. Finally, the group processes that most likely occurred inside the task force contained a range of gains and losses. The group shared information, competence, and decision-making, but it was also vulnerable to groupthink owing to the task's pressure and the homogeneity of the group members. To prevent groupthink, the task force should have promoted dissent and discussion among members, as well as encouraged varied viewpoints and critical thinking.
