Given that this task force was formed to solve a particular crisis scenario, it is probable that its group processes were centered on problem-solving and decision-making. The group presumably collaborated to collect information and data, evaluate the possible risks and rewards of various choices, and eventually decide how to proceed. The group's ability to harness the skills and experience of each individual member, allowing for a well-rounded and educated decision-making process, might be a possible benefit of this procedure. Through brainstorming and group discussion, the group may have been able to produce a bigger number of viable answers and ideas. However, there are also possible losses inside the work group. One possible loss is that the group may have been susceptible to groupthink, a phenomenon in which members of a group make unreasonable or harmful judgments out of a desire for group cohesion and consensus. In addition, the group may have been at danger of group polarization, which occurs when the collective's choices or opinions become more extreme than those of its individual members. This might have led to the group making a choice that was ill-considered or not in the best interest of the nation as a whole. There were possible concerns, such as groupthink, that may have badly influenced the group's capacity to make effective judgments.
