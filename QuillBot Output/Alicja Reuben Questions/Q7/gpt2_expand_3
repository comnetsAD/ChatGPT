The task force was consisted of high-level government officials who were able to make judgments swiftly and effectively. This contributed to the task force's capacity to move rapidly and efficiently. The following are some of the members of the group that are most likely no longer with us: The members of the task force were high-level government officials who had been chosen by President Trump. This creates the possibility of their engaging in groupthink. As a consequence of this, there is a possibility that they were susceptible to the phenomenon known as groupthink, which occurs when members of a group adopt the perspectives and choices of the group's dominant members or its leader. The task force was made up of persons who had all been chosen by President Trump, therefore there was a distinct lack of diversity among the members. As a result, there may not have been enough variety in terms of the political convictions, professional backgrounds, and experiences of the participants, which may have resulted in a lack of alternative viewpoints and ideas. In conclusion, it is probable that the task force that President Trump assembled to unlock the United States economy from its lockup went through a variety of group processes, some of which resulted in wins, while others resulted in losses. The group was able to make choices fast because they shared their skills, had a well-defined purpose, and worked together. On the other hand, because of the uniformity of the group as a whole and the preponderant leadership of the President, they ran the danger of engaging in groupthink.
