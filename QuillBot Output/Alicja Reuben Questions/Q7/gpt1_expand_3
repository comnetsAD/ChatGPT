The many gains and losses that may have occurred as a result of the group processes that took place inside this task group are a distinct possibility. The members of the group likely shared their knowledge and areas of expertise with one another, which allowed for more informed decisions to be made thanks to the consideration of multiple points of view. Additionally, the group was able to complete a difficult task with a sense of shared responsibility, which was another one of the gains that likely occurred within the group. Nevertheless, there were also a number of probable deaths that may have happened among the group's members. Groupthink was one of the most significant possible setbacks that may have been faced by the task team. The phenomenon known as "groupthink" occurs when members of a group become so dedicated to a specific course of action that they fail to take into consideration alternate viewpoints or possibilities. This may result in poor decision making as well as an inability to think critically. There were several different things that contributed to the possibility of groupthink occurring inside the task force. One of the most important aspects is the fact that the group was made up of people who worked for the same administration and who may have same political ideals and goals. This is one of the primary variables. Additionally, the panel was under pressure from the President to make speedy judgments in order to open the economy, which might have contributed to a rush to judgment and a lack of examination of other choices. To summarize, the group processes that most likely took place inside the task force contained a wide range of wins and losses in various forms. In spite of the fact that the members of the group shared their knowledge, experience, and decision-making responsibilities, there was still a possibility that they might engage in groupthink owing to the intensity of the job at hand and the similarity of their backgrounds. The task force should have fostered different viewpoints and critical thinking among its members, as well as allowed for dissent and discussion so as to avoid falling into the trap of groupthink.
