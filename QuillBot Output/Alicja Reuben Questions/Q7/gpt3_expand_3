Given that the purpose of this task force was to respond to a particular crisis scenario, it is quite probable that the group processes that took place inside the task force were centered on the process of problem-solving and decision-making. The group most likely collaborated in order to collect information and data, evaluate the possible risks and advantages of various possibilities, and eventually make a decision about how to proceed. It's possible that one of the benefits of going through this process was that the team was able to draw from the knowledge and experience of each individual member, which made it possible for them to make decisions that were well-rounded and based on accurate information. In addition, the group may have been able to come up with a bigger number of possible ideas and solutions by engaging in group debate and brainstorming. However, there is also the possibility of losses happening inside the working group itself. It is possible that the group was at danger of engaging in groupthink, which is a phenomena in which members of a group make judgments that are unreasonable or harmful owing to a desire for unity and consensus within the group. This is one of the potential losses that may have occurred. This is more likely to happen when the group is very cohesive, has a strong feeling of invulnerability, and is under a high amount of pressure to conform. This may have been the case here since the group needed to make quick judgments under duress in order to solve the crisis situation. In addition, there is a possibility that the group was at danger of group polarization, which occurs when the choices or attitudes of the group become more extreme than the starting stance of the group's individual members. It's possible that as a consequence of this, the group as a whole made a choice that wasn't very well thought through or that wasn't in the best interest of the nation as a whole. The group processes that most likely took place within the task force may have been beneficial in terms of problem-solving and decision-making; however, there were also potential risks, such as groupthink, that could have negatively impacted the group's ability to make sound decisions. In general, while the group processes that most likely took place may have been beneficial,
