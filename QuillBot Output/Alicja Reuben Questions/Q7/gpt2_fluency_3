The group procedures that took place inside President Trump's task force to unlock the US economy from the lockdown most certainly featured a mix of benefits and losses. Some of the gains that are believed to have occurred inside the group include: The task force established a clear and defined purpose: The task force established a clear and explicit goal of releasing the US economy from the lockdown. The task group was made of persons with competence in fields such as business, agriculture, and transportation, allowing for a diverse variety of opinions and ideas to be examined. Decision-making speed: The task force was made up of high-level government officials who could make judgments fast and efficiently. Some of the losses that are thought to have occurred within the group include: The risk of groupthink: The task team was made up of high-level government officials chosen by President Trump. As a consequence, they may have been vulnerable to groupthink, which occurs when members of a group adhere to the leader's or dominant members' beliefs and judgments. Lack of diversity in the group: The task force was made up entirely of those chosen by President Trump. As a result, there may have been a lack of variety in terms of political opinions, professional backgrounds, and experiences, leading to a lack of diverse viewpoints and ideas. Finally, the task force established by President Trump to free the US economy from the lockdown most certainly witnessed a mix of benefits and losses in terms of group processes. The group had a clear aim, shared skills, and made swift judgments. However, because of the group's homogeneity and the President's powerful leadership, they were vulnerable to groupthink.
