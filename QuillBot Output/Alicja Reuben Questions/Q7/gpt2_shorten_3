The task force's competence in business, agriculture, and transportation allowed for many viewpoints and ideas. High-level government officials on the task team could make judgments fast and efficiently. Group losses may have included: Groupthink: Trump selected high-level government officials to the task panel. Thus, they may have been at danger of groupthink, when group members follow the leader or dominant members.
