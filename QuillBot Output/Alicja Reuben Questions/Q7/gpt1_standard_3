Many gains and losses would have been experienced throughout the group processes that most likely occurred inside this work group. The capacity to share information and skills, to consider many points of view when making choices, and to complete a challenging work with a feeling of shared responsibility are just a few advantages that probably developed inside the group. Within the group, there were a number of possible losses that may have happened. Groupthink is one of the primary possible losses that the task team may have encountered. Groupthink is a phenomena when people in a group get so focused on one course of action that they overlook other alternatives. This may result in sloppy judgment and a lack of critical thinking. The task force was at danger of groupthink for a number of reasons. The fact that the group included members of the same administration, who may have shared political ideologies and ambitions, is one of the major contributing reasons. The panel was also under the President's pressure to act quickly in order to open the economy, which may have caused a rush to judgment and a failure to take other choices into account. In conclusion, a range of benefits and losses were likely experienced throughout the task force's group activities. Due to the strain of the work and the homogeneity of the group members, the group was at danger of groupthink but also shared information, competence, and decision-making. The task force should have promoted varied viewpoints and critical thinking, as well as allowed for dissent and discussion among members, to prevent groupthink.
