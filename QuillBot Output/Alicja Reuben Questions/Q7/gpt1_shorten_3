This task group undoubtedly had several wins and defeats. The group likely gained by sharing information and skills, considering diverse views to make better judgments, and working together to complete a challenging assignment. However, numerous group losses were possible. Groupthink might have cost the task team. Groupthink occurs when group members become so focused on one course of action that they ignore other choices. This may impair critical thinking and decision-making. The task force faced significant groupthink risks. The group was made up of people from the same administration, who may have shared political views and goals. The President pressured the panel to make hasty choices to open the economy, which may have caused them to rush to judgment and overlook other possibilities. In conclusion, task force group processes undoubtedly contained benefits and losses. Due to task pressure and homogeneity, the group shared information, experience, and decision-making but also risked groupthink. The task force should have fostered diversity, critical thinking, and discussion to prevent groupthink.
