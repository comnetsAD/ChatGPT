Pooling of knowledge: Because the task force included people with experience in industries including business, agriculture, and transportation, a variety of viewpoints and ideas were taken into consideration. The task group was made up of high-ranking government representatives with the capacity to make decisions fast and effectively. Among the losses that probably occurred within the group are: The task team was made up of senior government officials who were chosen by President Trump, raising the possibility of groupthink. They might have been vulnerable to groupthink, which occurs when members of a group follow the directives of the leader or other dominant members.
