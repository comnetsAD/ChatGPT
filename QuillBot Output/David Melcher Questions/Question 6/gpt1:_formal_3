Voluntary attention, also known as endogenous attention, is the capacity to voluntarily focus attention to a particular stimuli or activity. It includes the purposeful, conscious management of attention and is often used when a person is attempting to concentrate on a certain job or must filter out distracting information. Reflexive attention, also known as exogenous attention, is the capture of attention automatically by a prominent or unexpected stimuli. It involves no conscious control and is often triggered by environmental stimuli such as loud sounds, bright lights, or quick movements. It is a more passive process than intentional attention, and it is believed to be an adaptive reaction that enables the person to respond rapidly to possible environmental hazards. Both voluntary and reflexive attention entail the assignment of cognitive resources to certain stimuli or activities. Both forms of attention may be affected by a person's objectives and expectations, as well as their view of the outside world. Voluntary attention is a deliberate, intentional activity, while reflexive attention is automatic and passive. Reflexive attention is aroused by prominent or unexpected stimuli, while voluntary attention is focused toward specified objectives and activities. Voluntary attention requires the conscious management of cognitive resources, while reflexive attention is prompted by environmental signals. In conclusion, voluntary attention is the capacity to intentionally direct attention toward a particular stimulus or activity, and it is often used when a person is attempting to concentrate on a certain subject. Reflexive attention is the automatic and unconscious capture of attention by a prominent or unexpected stimuli. Both forms of attention entail the allocation of cognitive resources to particular stimuli or activities, but their control mechanisms and stimuli-specific triggers are distinct.
