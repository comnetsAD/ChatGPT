Both reflexive (exogenous) and voluntary (endogenous) attention are forms of attention, but they act differently and are triggered differently. Similarities: The capacity to concentrate on certain stimuli while disregarding others is shared by both reflexive and deliberate attention. The parietal cortex and the prefrontal cortex, among other brain areas, are assumed to be active during both forms of attention. Both forms of attention are capable of coexisting and influencing one another. Differences: Our own objectives, intentions, and internal emotions are what cause us to pay voluntary attention. We have conscious control over it and may direct it in different directions towards various environmental elements. It is sometimes referred to as "top-down" attention since it is governed by the higher cognitive functions of the brain. Sudden, unexpected, or salient environmental cues cause reflexive attention to be drawn. Regardless of our objectives or ambitions, it draws our attention since it is an involuntary reaction that happens without our conscious involvement. It is often referred regarded as "bottom-up" attention since it is governed by the brain's more fundamental sensory operations. Reflexive attention cannot be maintained for as long as voluntary attention, which is more adaptable. Reflexive attention is exclusively focused on outward stimuli, while voluntary attention may be focused on interior states like ideas, memories, or emotions. In conclusion, reflexive and voluntary attention are two forms of attention that have different triggers and workings. Our own aims and intentions serve as the catalyst for voluntary attention, which is controlled consciously, more adaptable, and capable of being maintained for longer periods of time. Reflexive attention is an instinctive reaction that takes place without conscious control and catches our attention regardless of our objectives or intentions. It is elicited by abrupt, unexpected, or prominent events in the environment. Although it is believed that the same brain areas are active in both forms of attention, they may work in tandem and have an impact on one another. Both types of attention entail the capacity to selectively concentrate on certain stimuli while ignoring others.
