Both voluntary (endogenous) and reflexive (exogenous) attention are forms of attention, but they act differently and are triggered differently. Both voluntary and reflexive attention include the capacity to deliberately concentrate on particular stimuli while disregarding others. It is believed that both forms of attention engage the same brain areas, including the parietal cortex and the prefrontal cortex. Both forms of attention may function concurrently and affect one another. Distinctions: Voluntary attention is activated by our own objectives, intentions, and internal moods. It is within our conscious control, and we may direct it toward various environmental features. Attention generated by the brain's higher cognitive processes is sometimes known as "top-down" attention. Environmental cues that are rapid, unexpected, or salient activate reflexive attention. It is an unconscious, spontaneous reaction that attracts our attention regardless of our intentions or aims. As it is driven by the brain's lower-level sensory processes, it is also known as "bottom-up" attention. Relative to reflexive attention, voluntary attention is more adaptable and may be maintained for longer durations. Voluntary attention may be directed toward interior states like ideas, memories, and emotions, while reflexive attention is exclusively focused toward external inputs. In conclusion, voluntary and reflexive attention are two forms of attention that work and are activated differently. Voluntary attention is prompted by our own objectives and intentions; it is under our conscious control; it is more flexible and can be maintained for longer durations; and it is under our conscious control. Reflexive attention is activated by abrupt, unexpected, or conspicuous environmental stimuli; it is an unconscious, instinctive reaction; and it catches our attention regardless of our aims or intentions. Both forms of attention require the capacity to selectively concentrate on specific inputs while ignoring others, and they are believed to entail the activity of the same brain areas, although they may work concurrently and can affect one another.
