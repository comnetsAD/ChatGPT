Both reflexive (exogenous) and voluntary (endogenous) attention exist, but they are activated and function in different ways. Similarities The capacity to pay attention just to some of the stimuli present, while disregarding the rest, is shared by both deliberate and reflexive attention. Researchers have found similarities in brain activity between the two forms of attention, namely in the parietal cortex and the prefrontal cortex. The two forms of focus may coexist and even affect one another. Distinctions: our own desires, intentions, and emotional states activate our voluntary attention. We may choose where to focus it and what to change about our surroundings. Top-down attention is directed by the more sophisticated parts of the brain. Environment cues that are novel, startling, or highly noticeable might cause a person to focus their attention reflexively. It's a reflex that happens whether or not we want it to, and it always manages to get our attention. Because it is prompted by the brain's more primitive sensory systems, this kind of focus is often called "bottom-up" attention. Attention that is given on a voluntary basis is more malleable and may be maintained for longer than attention that is given automatically. While the focus of reflexive attention is limited to outward stimuli, the focus of voluntary attention is open to interior states including ideas, memories, and emotions. In conclusion, the triggering and operation of voluntary and reflexive attention are distinct from one another. Voluntary attention is different from involuntary attention in that it is prompted by our own objectives and intents, is consciously under our control, is more adaptable, and can be maintained for longer periods of time. Reflexive attention is an instinctive reaction that happens without conscious control and catches our attention regardless of our objectives or intentions, and it is triggered by abrupt, unexpected, or prominent events in the environment. Both forms of attention require the capacity to attend to certain stimuli while disregarding others; they are also assumed to involve the same brain areas; nevertheless, these two types of attention may work together and have an impact on one another.
