Voluntary attention, also known as endogenous attention, is the capacity to intentionally focus one's attention to a particular stimuli or activity. It entails the purposeful, conscious management of attention and is often utilized when a person is attempting to concentrate on a certain activity or while filtering out distracting information. The automatic capture of attention by a prominent or unexpected stimuli is known as reflexive attention, also known as external attention. It is uncontrollable and is often caused by environmental signals such as loud sounds, bright lights, or abrupt movements. It is a less active process than voluntary attention and is regarded to be an adaptive reaction that helps the person to respond swiftly to possible hazards in the environment. Similarities include the allocation of cognitive resources to certain stimuli or activities in both voluntary and reflexive attention. Individuals' aims and expectations may impact both forms of attention, affecting their experience of the environment. Voluntary attention is a deliberate, intentional activity, while reflexive attention is automatic and passive. Voluntary attention is focused on particular objectives and activities, while reflexive attention is aroused by unexpected or salient events. Voluntary attention is the conscious management of cognitive resources, while reflexive attention is prompted by external signals. In summary, voluntary attention is the capacity to intentionally direct one's attention toward a certain stimuli or activity, and it is often utilized when one is attempting to concentrate on a specific task. The involuntary capture of attention by a prominent or unexpected stimuli is known as reflexive attention, and it does not require conscious control. Both forms of attention entail the assignment of cognitive resources to certain stimuli or activities, but they are controlled by distinct systems and are activated by various sorts of stimuli.
