The capacity to deliberately focus attention toward a particular stimulus or activity is referred to as voluntary attention, which is also referred to as endogenous attention. When a someone is attempting to concentrate on a particular activity or when there is a need to filter out distracting information, it is common practice for that person to engage in the purposeful, conscious regulation of their attention. The automatic capturing of one's attention by a striking or unexpected stimuli is an example of reflexive attention, which is sometimes referred to as external attention. It is not within the control of the conscious mind, and it is often brought on by environmental signals such as abrupt movements, bright lights, or loud sounds. It is a mechanism that is less active than voluntary attention, and it is believed to be an adaptive reaction that enables the person to respond rapidly to possible dangers in the surrounding environment. Both voluntary and reflexive attention entail the allocation of cognitive resources to certain stimuli or activities. Similarities Both types of attention include the use of cognitive resources. Both forms of attention may be affected by a person's objectives and expectations, which in turn can have an effect on how the individual perceives the world around them. There are two types of attention: voluntary attention, which is an intentional and conscious activity, and reflexive attention, which is automatic and unconsciously performed. The focus of one's attention may be either voluntary or reflexive. Voluntary attention is voluntarily directed toward certain objectives and activities, whereas reflexive attention is activated by unexpected or salient stimuli. Attention may be either voluntary or reflexive. Voluntary attention requires conscious control of one's cognitive resources, whereas reflexive attention is prompted by environmental signals. In a nutshell, the capacity to deliberately direct one's attention toward a certain stimuli or job is known as voluntary attention. This skill is often put to use when a someone is attempting to concentrate on a particular endeavor. The involuntary capturing of one's attention by a striking or unexpected stimuli is an example of reflexive attention; this kind of attention does not entail conscious control. Both forms of attention entail the allocation of cognitive resources to certain stimuli or activities; nevertheless, the processes that govern the two types of attention are distinct, as are the sorts of stimuli that cause them to be activated.
