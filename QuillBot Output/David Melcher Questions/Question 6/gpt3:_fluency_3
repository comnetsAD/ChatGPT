The capacity to choose concentrate one's attention on a certain activity or stimuli is referred to as voluntary attention, also known as endogenous attention. It is conscious in nature and includes cognitive processes such as working memory and decision making. The automatic or unconscious allocation of attention to a stimuli based on its prominence or relevance is referred to as reflexive attention, also known as exogenous attention. It is uncontrollable and may be provoked by a variety of triggers, such as loud sounds or quick movements. The allocation of attention to certain stimuli is one commonality between voluntary and reflexive attention. There are, nevertheless, significant distinctions between the two. Voluntary attention is aware, but reflexive attention is not. Voluntary attention requires cognitive processes such as working memory and decision making, while reflexive attention is activated automatically by salient or relevant stimuli. Furthermore, voluntary attention is often oriented toward particular activities or objectives, while reflexive attention is generally activated by environmental inputs. In summary, voluntary attention and reflexive attention are similar in that they both involve the allocation of attention to specific stimuli, but they differ in that voluntary attention is under conscious control and reflexive attention is not, that voluntary attention involves the use of cognitive processes such as working memory and decision making, and that reflexive attention is triggered automatically by salient or relevant stimuli, and that voluntary attention is frequently directede
