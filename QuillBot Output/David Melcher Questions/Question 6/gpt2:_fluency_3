Both voluntary (endogenous) and reflexive (exogenous) attention are forms of attention, but they vary in how they are activated and how they function. Similarities include the capacity to selectively concentrate on particular stimuli while disregarding others in both voluntary and reflexive attention. Both forms of attention are assumed to involve the same brain areas, such as the parietal cortex and the prefrontal cortex. Both forms of attention may be active at the same time and impact each other. Differences: Our own aims, motivations, and internal emotions cause us to pay attention voluntarily. We have conscious control over it, and we can direct it toward various components of the environment. It is also characterized as "top-down" attention since it is driven by higher cognitive processes in the brain. Reflexive attention is aroused by unexpected, abrupt, or prominent stimuli in the environment. It is an involuntary reaction that happens without our conscious control and attracts our attention regardless of our intentions or aims. It is also known as "bottom-up" attention since it is driven by lower-level sensory processes in the brain. Voluntary attention is more adaptable and may last longer than reflexive attention. Voluntary attention may be directed to internal states like ideas, memories, or emotions, but reflexive attention can only be directed to outward stimuli. In summary, voluntary and reflexive attention vary in how they are activated and how they work. Voluntary attention is elicited by our own objectives and intentions, is within our conscious control, is more flexible, and can be maintained for longer periods of time. Reflexive attention is generated in the environment by abrupt, unexpected, or prominent stimuli; it is an involuntary reaction that happens without conscious control, and it catches our attention regardless of our aims or intentions. Both forms of attention require the capacity to selectively concentrate on specific inputs while ignoring others, and they are assumed to involve the same brain areas, although they may work concurrently and impact one another.
