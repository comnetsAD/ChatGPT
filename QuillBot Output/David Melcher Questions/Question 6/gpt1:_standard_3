The capacity to intentionally focus attention on a particular stimuli or activity is referred to as voluntary attention, also known as endogenous attention. It entails the purposeful, conscious management of attention and is often used when someone is attempting to concentrate on a particular job or needs to block out distracting information. The automatic capture of attention by a prominent or unexpected stimuli is referred to as reflexive attention, also known as external attention. Environmental signals like loud sounds, bright lights, or quick movements are often what cause it to happen since it does not need cognitive control. It is considered to be an adaptive reaction that enables the person to react swiftly to possible hazards in the environment. It is a more passive process than intentional attention. Similarities: Devoting cognitive resources to certain stimuli or activities is a component of both reflexive and voluntary attention. Goals and expectations of the person may have an impact on both forms of attention and how they see the environment. Reflexive attention is automatic and passive, while voluntary attention is an intentional, deliberate activity. While reflexive attention is prompted by salient or unexpected stimuli, voluntary attention is focused on certain objectives and activities. Reflexive attention is prompted by external signals, while voluntary attention requires the conscious management of cognitive resources. In conclusion, voluntary attention is the capacity to deliberately direct attention toward a certain stimulus or activity, and it is often used when a person is attempting to concentrate on a particular task. Without conscious control, reflexive attention is the involuntary capture of attention by a salient or unexpected stimuli. Although both forms of attention require devoting cognitive resources to certain stimuli or activities, they vary in their control mechanisms and the stimuli that cause them.
