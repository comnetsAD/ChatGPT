Voluntary (endogenous) and reflexive (exogenous) attention act differently. Similarities: Both reflexive and voluntary attention require deliberately disregarding inputs. Both forms of attention use the parietal cortex and prefrontal cortex. Both sorts of attention may interact. Differences: Goals, intentions, and internal moods activate voluntary attention. It is aware and may be directed toward various environmental variables. Higher cognitive processes induce "top-down" attention. Sudden, unexpected, or salient stimuli cause reflexive attention. Regardless of our aims or intentions, it catches our attention automatically. The brain's lower-level sensory processes generate "bottom-up" attention. Reflexive attention is more rigid and short-lived than voluntary attention. Reflexive attention focuses exclusively on outward inputs, whereas voluntary attention might be on ideas, memories, or emotions. In conclusion, voluntary and reflexive attention vary in their triggers and functions. Voluntary attention is deliberate, adaptable, and long-lasting. It is prompted by our objectives and intentions. Reflexive attention is an involuntary reaction to rapid, unexpected, or prominent environmental stimuli that catches our attention independently of our aims or intentions. Both forms of attention require selectively focusing on particular inputs while ignoring others and are assumed to involve the same brain areas, although they may work concurrently and impact each other.
