The capacity to deliberately direct one's attention on a particular activity or stimulus is referred to as voluntary attention, also known as endogenous attention. It is controlled consciously and uses cognitive abilities including working memory and decision-making. The automatic or unconscious allocation of attention to a stimuli based on its prominence or relevance is referred to as reflexive attention, also known as exogenous attention. It may be caused by a variety of stimuli, including loud sounds and abrupt movements, and is not conscious. The fact that both reflexive and voluntary attention entail directing attention toward certain stimuli is one commonality between them. Between the two, there are significant distinctions as well. Reflexive attention is not controlled consciously, but voluntary attention is. Reflexive attention is brought about by salient or pertinent stimuli, while voluntary attention is brought about by cognitive processes like working memory and decision-making. Furthermore, although reflexive attention is often brought on by environmental cues, voluntary attention is frequently focused on particular activities or objectives. In conclusion, voluntary attention and reflexive attention are similar in that they both entail allocating attention to particular stimuli, but they differ in that voluntary attention is controlled consciously while reflexive attention is not, voluntary attention uses cognitive processes like working memory and decision-making, whereas reflexive attention is automatically triggered by salient or relevant stimuli, and voluntary attention is frequently directed at one thing.
