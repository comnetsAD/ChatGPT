Both voluntary (endogenous) and reflexive (exogenous) attention are forms of attention; nevertheless, the ways in which they are triggered and the ways in which they function are distinct between the two types. Both voluntary and reflexive attention need the capacity to selectively concentrate on specific inputs while disregarding others. Similarities Both types of attention require the ability to pay attention. It is believed that both forms of attention involve the activation of the same parts of the brain, including the parietal cortex and the prefrontal cortex. Both kinds of attention may work at the same time and can have an effect on one another. The key difference is that our own objectives, intentions, and emotional moods are what cause us to pay attention voluntarily. It is within our conscious control, and we have the ability to direct it towards various components of the surrounding world. This kind of attention is sometimes referred to as "top-down" attention since it is driven by the higher cognitive processes in the brain. Environment-based stimuli that are abrupt, unexpected, or particularly prominent might set off a person's reflexive attention. It is an involuntary reaction that takes place without of our conscious control, and it commands our attention despite the fact that we have no particular objectives or aims in mind. Because it is driven by the brain's lower-level sensory processes, this kind of attention is often referred to as "bottom-up" attention. In comparison to reflexive attention, voluntary attention is more adaptable and has the capacity to be maintained for longer lengths of time. While reflexive attention is exclusively directed to external stimuli, voluntary attention may be directed inward to states such as ideas, memories, or emotions. Voluntary attention can also be directed outward. In a nutshell, the two forms of attention known as voluntary and reflexive attention are distinguished from one another in terms of how they are activated and how they function. It is within our conscious control, it is more flexible and can be maintained for longer lengths of time, and it is prompted by our own objectives and intentions. Voluntary attention may be kept for longer periods of time. Our attention is captured by reflexive attention whenever we are exposed to stimuli in the environment that are abrupt, unexpected, or prominent. This kind of attention is an instinctive reaction that takes place without our conscious control, and it does so independently of our objectives or intentions. Both forms of attention entail the capacity to selectively concentrate on specific stimuli while ignoring others. It is believed that both types of attention involve the activity of the same brain areas. However, both types of attention may function concurrently and can affect one another.
