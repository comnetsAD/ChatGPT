During a group activity including a visit to a laboratory that investigates the neurological basis of memory, I gained some knowledge about the brain. Researchers at the laboratory employ a variety of methods, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electrophysiology (EEG), and optogenetics, to investigate how the brain processes information and makes memories. During our lab visit, we learnt about a study that examined the significance of a particular brain area called the hippocampus in spatial memory. The research manipulated the activity of particular neurons in the hippocampus of mice while they walked a labyrinth using optogenetics. Researchers discovered that when they selectively stimulated neurons in the hippocampus, mice performed better in the maze, indicating that these neurons play a crucial role in spatial memory. This research was intriguing because it revealed the neurological mechanisms behind memory creation and how certain brain areas, such as the hippocampus, play a crucial role in memory operations. In addition, the study's use of optogenetics to regulate the activity of individual neurons in the hippocampus in vivo contributed to a clearer understanding of the neuronal processes underpinning spatial memory. During a group activity in which we toured a laboratory that investigates the neurological foundation of memory, I discovered that particular brain areas, such as the hippocampus, play a crucial role in the creation of spatial memory. This is consistent with the findings of (Samantha J. Fox and the Moser group, 2016), who discovered that the hippocampus is a crucial brain area for the establishment of spatial memory. In addition, the study's use of optogenetics to regulate the activity of individual neurons in the hippocampus in vivo contributed to a clearer understanding of the neuronal processes underpinning spatial memory.
