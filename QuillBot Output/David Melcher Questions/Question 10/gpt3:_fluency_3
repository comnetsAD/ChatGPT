During a group activity in which we toured a lab that researches the neurological foundation of memory, I learnt something about the brain. The researchers in the lab explore how the brain processes information and makes memories using a variety of methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electrophysiology (EEG), and optogenetics. During our lab visit, one of the research we learnt about focused on the significance of a particular brain area called the hippocampus in spatial memory. Optogenetics was utilized in the research to alter the activity of individual neurons in the hippocampus of mice while they walked a labyrinth. The mice fared better in the maze when the researchers selectively stimulated neurons in the hippocampus, indicating that these neurons play an important role in spatial memory. This research piqued my attention since it gave insight into the neurological mechanics behind memory creation and how certain brain areas such as the hippocampus play an important role in memory operations. Furthermore, using optogenetics to control the activity of individual neurons in the hippocampus in vivo provided for a better understanding of the brain processes underpinning spatial memory. In summary, I discovered that particular brain areas, such as the hippocampus, play a vital role in spatial memory creation during a group activity in which we visited a lab that researches the neurological foundation of memory. This is consistent with the findings of (Samantha J. Fox and the Moser group, 2016), who discovered that the hippocampus is a critical brain area for spatial memory development. Furthermore, using optogenetics to control the activity of individual neurons in the hippocampus in vivo provided for a better understanding of the brain processes underpinning spatial memory.
