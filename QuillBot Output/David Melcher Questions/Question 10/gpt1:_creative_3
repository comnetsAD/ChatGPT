Brain activity was monitored using fMRI while research participants considered their alternatives and made selections. Similarly to the findings of (Kable and Glimcher, 2007), we find that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the striatum play a critical role in expressing the worth of various choices while making decisions. Consistent with the findings of (Roesch and Olson, 2004), the vmPFC and the striatum have a high degree of correlation when it comes to reflecting the value of various possibilities during the decision-making process. I found this research fascinating since it shed light on the neurological mechanisms behind decision making and demonstrated the multifaceted nature of this cognitive task. Another surprising discovery was the correlation between vmPFC and striatal activity, which led me to conclude that the two regions collaborate to convey value. In summary, I learned during a group activity in which we visited a lab that studies the neural basis of decision making that when participants were presented with different options, different areas of the brain, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the striatum, were activated, and the level of activation in these areas was related to the perceived value of the options. It's quite similar to the research done by (Kable and Glimcher, 2007). The researchers identified a robust correlation between vmPFC and striatal activity, which they interpret as evidence that the two regions may collaborate to express value during decision making. That accords with the findings of the research by (Roesch and Olson, 2004).
