Visiting a memory lab with a group taught me about the brain. The lab studies brain processing and memory using fMRI and EEG. Our lab visit included a memory study. While participants memorized a set of words, fMRI measured brain activity. Participants were presented the list again and asked to recall the terms they had learned. During memory encoding and retrieval, the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex active. (Eldridge, et al. 2005) discovered that the hippocampus, prefrontal, and parietal cortices are involved in memory encoding and retrieval. This research revealed how distinct brain areas may be engaged in memory encoding and retrieval. The hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex were closely connected, suggesting that they may work together to encode and recall memories. The hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex are tightly connected in memory encoding and retrieval (Squire and Wixted, 2011). This research indicated that memory is complicated and includes several brain areas. I learned that the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex work together to encode and recall memories from their linked activity. During a group activity at a memory lab, I learnt that the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex were active during memory encoding and retrieval. Like the research by (Eldridge, et al. 2005). The researchers also discovered that the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex were closely connected, suggesting they may work together to encode and recall memories. The research by agrees (Squire and Wixted, 2011).
