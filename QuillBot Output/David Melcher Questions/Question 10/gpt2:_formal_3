During a group activity including a visit to a laboratory that investigates the neurological basis of memory, I gained some knowledge about the brain. Researchers in the lab employ a variety of methods, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrophysiology (EEG), to investigate how the brain processes information and generates memories. During our lab visit, we learnt about a study that examined how the brain stores and recovers memories. The research used fMRI to evaluate cerebral activity in the brains of volunteers who were challenged to remember a list of words. The participants were then asked to recall the words they had previously remembered after being presented the list of words again. During the encoding and retrieval of memories, many regions of the brain, including the hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex, and the parietal cortex, were shown to be active. This research is comparable to one done by (Eldridge et al., 2005) in which it was discovered that the hippocampus plays a crucial part in the encoding and retrieval of memories, while the prefrontal and parietal cortices are also implicated. This research shed light on how the brain encodes and recovers memories and how various brain areas may be involved. In addition, the researchers discovered that the activity of the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex was highly connected, suggesting that these regions may collaborate to encode and recover memories. This is consistent with the findings of Squire and Wixted (2011), who discovered that the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex are tightly connected in memory encoding and retrieval. This work was intriguing to me since it gave insight into the neurological mechanisms behind memory and demonstrated that it is a complicated, multiregional process. In addition, the fact that the activity in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex was associated showed that these regions collaborate to encode and recover memories, which was a novel realization for me. During a group activity in which we toured a laboratory that investigates the neurological basis of memory, I discovered that many regions of the brain, including the hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex, and the parietal cortex, are engaged during the encoding and retrieval of memories. This resembles the research undertaken by (Eldridge, et al. 2005). In addition, the researchers discovered that the activity of the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex was highly connected, indicating that these regions may collaborate to encode and recover memories. This is consistent with the research undertaken by (Squire and Wixted, 2011).
