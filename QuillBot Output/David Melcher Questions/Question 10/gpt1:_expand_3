During a group outing, we went to a facility that looked at the neuroscience of decision making, and I picked up some interesting facts about the brain. Scientists in the lab employ a variety of tools, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrophysiology (EEG), to investigate how the brain works when faced with new situations and making judgments. During our time in the laboratory, we learnt about a study that looked at how people's value systems are represented in their brains. Brain activity was monitored using fMRI while research participants considered their alternatives and made selections. Brain regions including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the striatum were shown to be active when participants were shown a variety of alternatives, with the intensity of this activation correlating with how highly people valued each of the choices. Similarly to the findings of (Kable and Glimcher, 2007), we find that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the striatum play a critical role in expressing the worth of various choices while making decisions. This research shed light on the potential roles of several brain areas in the valuation of alternatives during decision making. Moreover, the researchers discovered a robust correlation between vmPFC and striatal activity, suggesting that the two regions may collaborate to reflect value during decision making. Consistent with the findings of (Roesch and Olson, 2004), the vmPFC and the striatum have a high degree of correlation when it comes to reflecting the value of various possibilities during the decision-making process. I found this research fascinating since it shed light on the neurological mechanisms behind decision making and demonstrated the multifaceted nature of this cognitive task. Another surprising discovery was the correlation between vmPFC and striatal activity, which led me to conclude that the two regions collaborate to convey value. In summary, I learned during a group activity in which we visited a lab that studies the neural basis of decision making that when participants were presented with different options, different areas of the brain, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the striatum, were activated, and the level of activation in these areas was related to the perceived value of the options. It's quite similar to the research done by (Kable and Glimcher, 2007). The researchers identified a robust correlation between vmPFC and striatal activity, which they interpret as evidence that the two regions may collaborate to express value during decision making. That accords with the findings of the research by (Roesch and Olson, 2004).
