During a group outing, we saw a laboratory that focuses on the neurobiology of memory, and I picked up some interesting facts about the brain. Laboratory studies of cognitive processes and memory formation often use many methods, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrophysiology (EEG). When we visited the lab, we learnt about a study that examined memory encoding and retrieval. Participants were shown a list of items and instructed to recall them while brain activity was monitored using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The participants were presented the list of words again at a later time and asked to recall which ones they had previously learned. The hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex were identified as regions of the brain that were active during memory encoding and retrieval, among others. The hippocampus, together with the prefrontal and parietal cortices, play an important role in the encoding and retrieval of memories, as was demonstrated in a research quite similar to this one (Eldridge, et al., 2005). Understanding the roles of various brain areas in memory encoding and retrieval is a major takeaway from this research. Moreover, the researchers discovered a robust relationship between hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex activity, which they interpret as evidence that these brain regions collaborate during the encoding and retrieval of memories. This is consistent with research from (Squire and Wixted, 2011) that demonstrated a close relationship between the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex during the memory-encoding and -retrieval processes. I found this research fascinating since it shed light on the intricate neurological mechanisms behind memory and demonstrated how many different parts of the brain are involved. I also learned something new about how the brain works by seeing a correlation between activity in the hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex, and the parietal cortex. I discovered that the encoding and retrieval of memories stimulated many regions of the brain, including the hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex, and the parietal cortex, during a group activity in which we toured a lab that researches the neurological basis of memory. It's quite similar to the research done by (Eldridge, et al. 2005). The researchers also identified a robust correlation between activity in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex, which they interpret as evidence that these brain regions collaborate during memory encoding and retrieval. That accords with the findings of the research by (Squire and Wixted, 2011).
