Visiting a memory lab with a group taught me about the brain. The lab studies brain processing and memory using fMRI, EEG, and optogenetics. Our lab visit included a study on spatial memory and the hippocampus. While mice explored a labyrinth, optogenetics controlled particular hippocampal neurons. The mice fared better in the maze when they selectively engaged hippocampal neurons, showing they are important for spatial memory. This research showed me how the hippocampus and other brain areas contribute to memory formation. This work used optogenetics to control hippocampal neurons in vivo to better understand spatial memory brain circuits. During a group exercise at a memory lab, I learnt that the hippocampus is crucial to spatial memory formation. The hippocampus is essential for spatial memory development (Samantha J. Fox and the Moser lab, 2016). This work used optogenetics to control hippocampal neurons in vivo to better understand spatial memory brain circuits.
