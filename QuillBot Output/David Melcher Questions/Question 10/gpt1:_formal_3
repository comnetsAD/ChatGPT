During a group activity in which we toured a lab that examines the neurological basis of decision making, I learnt something about the brain. Researchers at the lab employ a variety of methods, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrophysiology (EEG), to investigate how the brain processes information and makes choices. During our lab visit, we learnt about a study that examined how the brain reflects value in decision making. The research measured neural activity in the brain using fMRI while subjects were presented with a variety of alternatives and asked to choose one. The amount of activity in these regions was connected to the perceived worth of the alternatives, the researchers discovered. This research is comparable to one done by (Kable and Glimcher, 2007) in which it was discovered that the vmPFC and the striatum play a crucial role in conveying the value of various choices during decision making. This research shed light on how the brain interprets value in decision making and which brain areas may be involved. In addition, the researchers discovered that the activity of the vmPFC and striatum was highly connected, suggesting that these regions may collaborate to reflect value in decision making. This is consistent with the findings of Roesch and Olson (2004), who discovered that the vmPFC and the striatum are highly connected in conveying the value of various possibilities during decision making. This work was intriguing to me because it gave insight into the neurological mechanisms behind decision making and demonstrated that it is a complicated, multiregional process. In addition, the correlation between vmPFC and striatal activity showed that both regions work together to reflect value, which was a novel realization for me. During a group activity in which we visited a laboratory that investigates the neural basis of decision making, I learned that different regions of the brain, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the striatum, were activated when participants were presented with different options, and that the level of activation in these regions was proportional to the perceived value of the options. This resembles the research undertaken by (Kable and Glimcher, 2007). In addition, the researchers discovered a high correlation between the activity of the vmPFC and the striatum, suggesting that both regions may work together to reflect value in decision making. This is consistent with the research undertaken by (Roesch and Olson, 2004).
