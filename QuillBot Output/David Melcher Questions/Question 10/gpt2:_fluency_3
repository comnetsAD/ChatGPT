During a group activity in which we toured a lab that researches the neurological foundation of memory, I learnt something about the brain. The researchers at the lab explore how the brain processes information and makes memories using a variety of methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrophysiology (EEG). During our lab visit, we learnt about one study that looked at how the brain stores and recovers memories. The researchers utilized functional MRI to detect neural activity in the brain while individuals memorized a list of phrases. The participants were then presented the list of words again and asked to recall the words they had previously learned. The researchers discovered that distinct parts of the brain, such as the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex, were engaged during memory encoding and retrieval. This research is comparable to one done by (Eldridge, et al. 2005), who discovered that the hippocampus is important in memory encoding and retrieval, as well as the prefrontal and parietal cortices. This research shed light on how the brain encodes and recovers memories, as well as how various brain areas may be involved in this process. The researchers also discovered that activity in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex was highly linked, indicating that these regions may collaborate to encode and recover memories. This is consistent with the findings of (Squire and Wixted, 2011), who discovered that the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex are tightly connected in memory encoding and retrieval. This work piqued my attention since it gave insight into the neurological mechanisms that underpin memory and demonstrated that it is a complicated process involving several brain areas. Furthermore, the correlation of activity in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex revealed that these regions collaborate to encode and recall memories, which was a novel idea for me. In summary, I discovered that multiple parts of the brain, including the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex, were active during memory encoding and retrieval during a group activity in which we visited a lab that researches the neurological basis of memory. This is comparable to the research done by (Eldridge, et al. 2005). Furthermore, the researchers discovered that activity in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex was closely connected, indicating that these regions may collaborate to encode and recall memories. This is consistent with the findings of the research (Squire and Wixted, 2011).
