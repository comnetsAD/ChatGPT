During a group activity when we toured a lab that investigates the neurological underpinnings of memory, I learnt something about the brain. To investigate how the brain processes information and creates memories, the lab's researchers use methods including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrophysiology (EEG). During our lab visit, one of the research that we learnt about was on how the brain stores and recovers memories. The participants in the research were given a list of phrases to learn while having their brain activity monitored using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The list of terms was afterwards displayed to the participants once again, and they were instructed to recall the words they had previously learned. The hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex, and the parietal cortex were among the regions of the brain that the researchers discovered were active during the encoding and retrieval of memories. This research is comparable to that of Eldridge et al. (2005) who discovered that the prefrontal and parietal cortices as well as the hippocampus are involved in the encoding and retrieval of memories. This research shed light on the possible roles that various brain areas may have in the encoding and retrieval of memories. Additionally, they discovered a high correlation between the activity in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex, indicating that these regions may cooperate to store and recall memories. This is consistent with a research by Squire and Wixted (2011), who discovered a substantial correlation between the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex in the encoding and retrieval of memories. This work caught my attention because it offered an insight into the neurological mechanisms behind memory and demonstrated how intricate and involving memory is, including several brain areas. Furthermore, I gained a new understanding of how the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex interact to encode and recall memories as a result of the correlation of their activity. I discovered, in summary, that several parts of the brain, such as the hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex, and the parietal cortex, were active during the encoding and retrieval of memories during a group activity in which we visited a lab that researches the neurological foundation of memory. This is comparable to the research done by (Eldridge, et al. 2005). The activity in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex was also shown to be closely connected, which showed that these regions may cooperate to encode and recover memories. This is consistent with the research done by (Squire and Wixted, 2011).
