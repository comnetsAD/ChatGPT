During a group activity in which we toured a lab that examines the neurological basis of decision making, I learnt something about the brain. The researchers at the lab explore how the brain processes information and makes choices using a variety of methods such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrophysiology (EEG). During our lab visit, we learnt about one study that looked at how the brain reflects value in decision making. The researchers employed functional MRI to monitor neural activity in the brain while individuals were presented with several alternatives and asked to make a decision. The researchers discovered that when participants were presented with different options, different areas of the brain, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the striatum, were activated, and that the level of activation in these areas was related to the perceived value of the options. This research is comparable to one done by (Kable and Glimcher, 2007), who discovered that the striatum and the vmPFC play an important role in conveying the value of various choices during decision making. This research shed light on how the brain reflects value in decision making and how various brain areas may be involved. The researchers also discovered that activity in the striatum and the vmPFC was closely connected, indicating that both regions may collaborate to reflect value in decision making. This is consistent with the findings of (Roesch and Olson, 2004), who discovered that the striatum and the vmPFC are significantly associated in conveying the value of various possibilities during decision making. This work piqued my attention since it gave insight into the neurological mechanisms that underpin decision making and demonstrated that it is a complicated process involving several brain areas. Furthermore, the fact that activity in the striatum and the vmPFC was associated showed that these regions collaborate to express value, which was a novel idea for me. In summary, during a group activity in which we visited a lab that studies the neural basis of decision making, I discovered that different areas of the brain, including the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the striatum, were activated when participants were presented with different options, and that the level of activation in these areas was related to the perceived value of the options.
