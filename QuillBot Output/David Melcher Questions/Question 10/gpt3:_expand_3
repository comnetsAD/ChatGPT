During a group activity in which we toured a laboratory that researches the neurological foundation of memory, I picked up some new information about the brain. Researchers in the lab make use of a wide variety of methodologies, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electrophysiology (EEG), and optogenetics, in order to investigate the ways in which the brain processes information and creates memories. During our time in the laboratory, we were exposed to a number of different research, one of which concerned the function of a particular area of the brain known as the hippocampus in the formation of spatial memories. While the mice were attempting to find their way around a labyrinth, the researchers utilized optogenetics to control the activity of particular neurons in the hippocampus of the mice. The fact that the researchers were able to improve the mice's performance in the maze by selectively activating neurons in the hippocampus lends credence to the theory that these neurons play an important part in the formation of spatial memories. This research piqued my attention because it offered a view into the neurological mechanisms that underpin the creation of memories, as well as how certain parts of the brain, such as the hippocampus, play an important part in memory-related functions. In addition, the use of optogenetics in this research project to regulate the activity of individual neurons in the hippocampus in vivo allowed for a clearer comprehension of the brain processes that are responsible for spatial memory. During a group activity in which we toured a laboratory that investigates the neurological foundation of memory, I gained the knowledge that certain parts of the brain, such as the hippocampus, play an important part in the process of forming spatial memories. This is consistent with the findings of the study carried out by Samantha J. Fox and the Moser lab (2016), in which the researchers discovered that the hippocampus is an important part of the brain for the creation of spatial memories. Additionally, the use of optogenetics in this work to regulate the activity of individual neurons in the hippocampus in vivo allows for a clearer comprehension of the neuronal processes that are responsible for spatial memory.
