During a group activity when we toured a facility that investigates the neurological underpinnings of decision-making, I learnt something about the brain. To better understand how the brain processes information and makes choices, researchers in the lab use methods like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrophysiology (EEG). During our lab visit, one of the research that we learnt about centered on how the brain conceptualizes value while making decisions. While subjects were given alternatives and asked to make a decision, the research employed fMRI to evaluate neural activity in the brain. The ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and the striatum, among other brain regions, were shown to be active when individuals were given a variety of alternatives, and the degree of activity in these regions was connected to the perceived value of the options. This research is comparable to that of Kable and Glimcher (2007), who discovered that the striatum and vmPFC are crucial for expressing the relative worth of various possibilities while making decisions. This research shed light on how the brain conceptualizes value in decision-making and how various brain areas could be involved. Additionally, the activity in the striatum and vmPFC showed a high correlation, which indicated that these regions could cooperate to reflect value in decision-making. This is consistent with a research by Roesch and Olson (2004) who discovered a substantial correlation between the vmPFC and the striatum in how well they express the relative worth of various possibilities while making decisions. This work caught my attention because it offered a view into the neurological mechanisms behind decision-making and demonstrated that it is a complicated process involving many different brain areas. Additionally, the correlation between the striatum and vmPFC activity showed that both regions collaborate to reflect value, which was a novel realization for me. In conclusion, I learned that different parts of the brain, such as the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and the striatum, were activated when participants were presented with different options and that the level of activation in these areas was correlated with the perceived value of the options during a group activity in which we visited a lab that studies the neural basis of decision making. This is comparable to the research done by (Kable and Glimcher, 2007). The activity in the striatum and the vmPFC were also found to be substantially connected, which showed that these regions may cooperate to reflect value in decision-making. This is consistent with the research done by (Roesch and Olson, 2004).
