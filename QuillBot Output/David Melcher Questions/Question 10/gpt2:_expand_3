During a group activity in which we toured a laboratory that researches the neurological foundation of memory, I picked up some new information about the brain. The investigators at the lab make use of a wide variety of methodologies, including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and electrophysiology (EEG), to investigate the ways in which the brain processes information and creates memories. The encoding and retrieval processes of memories were the subject of one of the research that we were familiar with during our time in the laboratory. The participants in the research were given a list of words to remember while they were being scanned with an fMRI machine, which measured the neural activity in their brains at the same time. After some time had passed, the participants were presented with the list of words once again and asked to recall those words that they had previously committed to memory. During both the process of storing new memories and retrieving old ones, the researchers discovered that several regions of the brain were active. These regions included the hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex, and the parietal cortex. This study is very similar to the one that was carried out by (Eldridge, et al. 2005), in which the researchers discovered that the hippocampus plays a crucial part in the encoding and retrieval of memories, and that the prefrontal and parietal cortices are also involved in the process. This study also found that the amygdala plays a role in the formation of new memories. This research shed light on how various parts of the brain may be involved in the process of encoding and retrieving memories, as well as how the process works overall. The fact that the activity in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex were tightly connected was another finding made by the researchers. This led them to hypothesize that these regions could collaborate to store and recall memories. This finding is consistent with the findings of the research carried out by Squire and Wixted (2011), who discovered that the encoding and retrieval of memories are significantly connected with the activity of the hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex, and the parietal cortex. This research piqued my attention because it offered a look into the neurological mechanisms that underpin memory and demonstrated that remembering anything is a complicated process that needs the participation of several areas of the brain. A novel realization for me was that the fact that the activity in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex were associated showed that these regions work together to work together to encode and recall memories. During a group activity in which we visited a lab that studies the neural basis of memory, I obtained the knowledge that various regions of the brain, such as the hippocampus, the prefrontal cortex, and the parietal cortex, were activated during the encoding and retrieval of memories. In summary, this was one of the most important things that I took away from the experience. This is comparable to the research that was carried out by (Eldridge, et al. 2005). The researchers found that the activity in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and parietal cortex were strongly correlated, which suggested that these areas may work together to encode and retrieve memories. In addition, the researchers discovered that the activity in the entorhinal cortex was strongly correlated. This is consistent with the findings of the research that was carried out by (Squire and Wixted, 2011).
