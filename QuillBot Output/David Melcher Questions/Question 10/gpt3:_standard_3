During a group activity when we toured a lab that investigates the neurological underpinnings of memory, I learnt something about the brain. To investigate how the brain processes information and creates memories, the lab's researchers use methods including functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), electrophysiology, and optogenetics. During our visit to the lab, one of the research that we learnt about was on the function of the hippocampus, a particular part of the brain, in spatial memory. Optogenetics was utilized in the research to control the activity of certain neurons in the hippocampus of mice as they moved through a labyrinth. The results showed that the mice performed better in the maze when certain neurons in the hippocampus were stimulated, indicating that these neurons are important for spatial memory. I found this research fascinating since it shed light on the neurological mechanics behind memory creation and how certain brain areas, like the hippocampus, are essential for memory functions. Additionally, optogenetics was used in this work to alter the activity of certain neurons in the hippocampus in real time, leading to a better comprehension of the neurological underpinnings of spatial memory. In conclusion, I discovered during a group activity when we visited a lab that researches the neurological foundation of memory that certain brain areas, such the hippocampus, are crucial for the development of spatial memory. This is consistent with a research by Samantha J. Fox and the Moser group from 2016 that discovered the hippocampus to be a critical brain area for the development of spatial memory. Additionally, optogenetics was used in this work to alter the activity of certain neurons in the hippocampus in real time, leading to a better comprehension of the neurological underpinnings of spatial memory.
