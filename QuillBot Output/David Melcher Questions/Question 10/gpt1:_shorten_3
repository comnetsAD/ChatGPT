A group activity in a neural decision-making lab taught me about the brain. The lab studies brain processing and decision-making using fMRI and EEG. Our lab visit included a study on how the brain reflects value in decision-making. While participants chose between choices, fMRI measured brain activity. When presented with alternative choices, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and striatum were active, and the amount of activity was linked to the perceived worth of the options. Similar to (Kable and Glimcher, 2007), this research demonstrated that the vmPFC and striatum reflect the value of various possibilities during decision making. This research revealed how distinct brain areas express value in decision making. The vmPFC and striatum were closely connected, suggesting that they may reflect value in decision making. The vmPFC and striatum substantially correlate in reflecting the value of various possibilities during decision making (Roesch and Olson, 2004). This research indicated that decision making is complicated and includes several brain areas. I also learned that the vmPFC and striatum reflect value jointly since their activity was connected. In summary, during a group activity in which we visited a lab that studies the neural basis of decision making, I learned that the ventromedial prefrontal cortex and striatum were activated when participants were presented with different options and that the level of activation was related to the perceived value of the options. Like the research by (Kable and Glimcher, 2007). The research by agrees (Roesch and Olson, 2004).
