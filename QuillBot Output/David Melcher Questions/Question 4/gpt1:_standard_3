The strength of synapses, which are the connections between neurons, fluctuates throughout learning and memory. During learning and memory, synapses may alter through a number of methods, including: Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a mechanism that strengthens synapses, increasing the likelihood that a postsynaptic neuron will produce an action potential. LTP is considered to be a memory-forming process. It is mediated by an increase in receptors at the synapses, especially NMDA receptors. The opposite of long-term plasticity (LTP), which results in a reduction in synaptic strength, is long-term depression (LTD). By selectively weakening synapses that are not being utilized, LTD is considered to contribute to learning. It is caused by a reduction in the number of receptors in the synapse, especially AMPA receptors. Synaptic scaling is the process by which all synapses on a neuron's strength are changed in order to maintain a balance between excitement and inhibition. It is mediated by the action of the glutamate and GABA receptors in the brain. Synaptogenesis is the process through which new synapses are formed. This process happens largely while the nervous system is growing, but it also happens when learning and memory are developing. These are some examples of the methods through which synapses might alter during learning and memory, and each one of these mechanisms entails the involvement of several receptors and neurotransmitters. For instance, NMDA and AMPA receptors are involved in LTP and LTD, respectively. On the other hand, synaptogenesis includes the action of neurotrophic and growth factors that support the development of new synapses.
