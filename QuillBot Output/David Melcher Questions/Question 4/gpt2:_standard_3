Changes in the strength of synapses, the connections between neurons, are a component of learning and memory. It is believed that these variations in synapse strength are what cause memories to originate and be stored. Long-Term Potentiation is one way that synapses may adapt as a result of learning (LTP). LTP is a process through which a synapse becomes stronger as a consequence of frequent or extended stimulation. This happens when there is an increase in the number of NMDA receptors, which are triggered by the neurotransmitter glutamate, at the postsynaptic membrane. The synapse is strengthened as a consequence of NMDA receptor activation, which sets off a series of actions. Long-Term Depression is just another instance of how synapses may alter during the learning process (LTD). LTD is the process through which a synapse's strength declines as a consequence of prolonged or frequent inhibition. This happens when the amount of postsynaptic membrane receptors, like as AMPA receptors, which are also triggered by the neurotransmitter glutamate, declines. The synapse weakens as a consequence of a series of processes that start when AMPA receptors are inhibited. In conclusion, changes in the strength of synapses have a role in learning and memory. These changes may occur via long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD). By increasing the quantity of postsynaptic membrane receptors, such as NMDA receptors, LTP strengthens synapses, while LTD weakens synapses by reducing the quantity of postsynaptic membrane receptors, such as AMPA receptors.
