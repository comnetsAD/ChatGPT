Learning and memory influence synaptic strength. These synaptic strength alterations may cause memory development and storage. Long-Term Potentiation changes synapses during learning (LTP). LTP strengthens a synapse by repeated stimulation. NMDA receptors, triggered by glutamate, increase in the postsynaptic membrane. NMDA receptor activation triggers a cascade that strengthens the synapse. Long-term depression is another learning-related synaptic alteration (LTD). LTD occurs when repetitive inhibition weakens a synapse. AMPA receptors, triggered by glutamate, diminish at the postsynaptic membrane. An AMPA receptor inhibition cascade weakens the synapse. In conclusion, LTP and LTD affect synaptic strength during learning and memory. LTP improves synaptic strength by boosting NMDA receptors at the postsynaptic membrane, whereas LTD reduces it by lowering AMPA receptors.
