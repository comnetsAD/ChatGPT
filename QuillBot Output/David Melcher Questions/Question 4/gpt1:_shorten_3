Learning and memory alter synaptic strength. Learning and memory modify synapses via numerous mechanisms: Long-term potentiation (LTP): This process strengthens a synapse, increasing the likelihood of an action potential in the postsynaptic neuron. LTP may establish memories. Increased synaptic receptors, especially NMDA receptors, cause it. Long-term depression (LTD): In contrast to LTP, synapse strength decreases. LTD weakens non-used synapses to aid learning. It decreases synaptic receptors, notably AMPA receptors. Synaptic scaling: This adjusts all synapses on a cell to balance excitement and inhibition. Glutamate and GABA receptors mediate it. Synaptogenesis: New synapses. This happens mostly during nervous system development but also during learning and memory formation. These systems modify synapses during learning and memory, using various receptors and neurotransmitters. LTP and LTD include NMDA and AMPA receptors. Growth and neurotrophic factors enhance synaptogenesis.
