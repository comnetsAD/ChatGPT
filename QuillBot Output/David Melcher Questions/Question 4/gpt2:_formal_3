Changes in the strength of synapses, the connections between neurons, are involved in learning and memory. It is believed that these variations in synapse strength underlie the creation and preservation of memories. Long-Term Potentiation is an example of a synaptic alteration that may occur during learning (LTP). LTP is the process through which repeated or sustained stimulation of a synapse improves its strength. This happens when there is an increase in the amount of glutamate-activated receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, such as NMDA receptors. The activation of NMDA receptors results in a series of actions that eventually strengthen the synapse. Long-Term Depression is another illustration of how synapses may alter throughout the process of learning (LTD). LTD is the process through which a synapse loses strength as a consequence of prolonged or recurrent inhibition. This happens when there is a reduction in the number of glutamate- and AMPA-activated receptors on the postsynaptic membrane. The inhibition of AMPA receptors results in a series of processes that eventually degrade the synaptic connection. In conclusion, learning and memory include changes in synaptic strength, which may occur through Long-term Potentiation (LTP) and Long-term Depression (LTD). LTP improves synaptic strength by increasing the number of postsynaptic receptors, such as NMDA receptors, while LTD reduces synaptic strength by lowering the number of postsynaptic receptors, such as AMPA receptors.
