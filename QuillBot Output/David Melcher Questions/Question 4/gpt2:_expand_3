The strength of the connections between neurons, or synapses, alter throughout the learning and memory processes. Memory development and storage are considered to depend on these shifts in synapse strength. Long-Term Potentiation (LTP) is an example of a synaptic alteration that may occur during learning (LTP). Repeated or extended stimulation of a synapse may enhance its strength, a phenomenon known as long-term potentiation (LTP). This happens when glutamate, a neurotransmitter, causes a rise in the amount of postsynaptic membrane receptors, such as NMDA receptors. A series of actions initiated by the activation of NMDA receptors culminate in the fortification of the synapse. Long-term depression is another example of a learning condition that may cause synapses to alter (LTD). The term "long-term depression" (or "LTD") refers to the weakening of a synapse after being inhibited for an extended period of time. This happens when glutamate receptors, such AMPA receptors, at the postsynaptic membrane are depleted. Inhibiting AMPA receptors triggers a chain reaction that eventually weakens the synapse. In conclusion, learning and memory both need changes in synaptic strength, which may occur through Long-term Potentiation (LTP) and Long-term Depression (LTD). For example, long-term potentiation (LTP) strengthens synapses by raising the abundance of NMDA receptors on the postsynaptic membrane, whereas long-term depression (LTD) weakens synapses by lowering the abundance of AMPA receptors.
