Synapses are the connections between neurons in the brain, and learning and memory both entail changes in the strength of these connections. During the processes of learning and memory, synapses may undergo modification via a number of different pathways, including the following: Long-term potentiation, often known as LTP, is a process in which the strength of a synapse is strengthened over time. This, in turn, makes it more probable that a postsynaptic neuron will produce an action potential. LTP is assumed to be a process that is involved in the creation of memories. At the synapse, this effect is mediated by an increase in the number of receptors, in particular NMDA receptors. The opposite of long-term potentiation (LTP), long-term depression (LTD) is characterized by a reduction in the efficacy of synapses. It is believed that LTD contributes to learning by selectively weakening synapses that are not being engaged at the time of learning. At the synapse, this phenomenon is mediated by a reduction in the total number of receptors, in particular AMPA receptors. Synaptic scaling is a process in which the intensity of all synapses on a neuron is changed to maintain a balance of excitement and inhibition. This is done in order to keep a neuron functioning normally. It is brought about as a result of the action of the glutamate and GABA receptors on the neurons. Synaptogenesis refers to the process through which new synapses are formed. This process takes place most prominently during the maturation of the nervous system, but it also takes place throughout the learning process and the generation of memories. These are some examples of how synapses might alter throughout the process of learning and memory, and each of these ways involves a unique combination of receptors and neurotransmitters. For example, NMDA and AMPA receptors are involved in long-term potentiation (LTP) and long-term depression (LTD), respectively. Synaptogenesis, on the other hand, is the process that promotes the development of new synapses and includes the action of growth factors as well as neurotrophic factors.
