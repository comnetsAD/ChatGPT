Neuronal connections—synapses—change throughout learning and memory. Synaptic strength and formation may cause these alterations. Long-term potentiation changes synapses during learning (LTP). Repetitive brain activity causes LTP, which increases synaptic strength. It may underpin many learning and memory processes. LTP is hypothesized to occur by many processes, including the insertion of additional AMPA receptors, which enable calcium ions to enter the cell, into the postsynaptic membrane. AMPA receptors promote postsynaptic neuron excitability and synaptic strength. Synaptic scaling changes synapses during learning. Synaptic scaling adjusts all neuron synapses to maintain a consistent excitation level. Neural activity, such as a neuron's number of connections, might cause this process. This technique may avoid runaway excitation and improve neuronal activity regulation by stabilizing neural networks. Long-term potentiation and synaptic scaling modify synapses during learning and memory. LTP, a permanent increase in synaptic strength caused by recurrent neuronal activation, may underpin many kinds of learning and memory. New AMPA receptors in the postsynaptic membrane may cause it. Synaptic scaling adjusts all synapses on a neuron to maintain a consistent excitation level, stabilizing neural networks.
