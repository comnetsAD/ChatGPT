Memory and learning entail modifications to synapses, the connections between neurons. Several processes, including changes in synaptic strength and the development of new synapses, may cause these alterations. Long-term potentiation is an example of a mechanism through which synapses may alter during learning (LTP). LTP is a sustained increase in synaptic strength resulting from repeated neuronal activation. It is believed to underpin several learning and memory processes. LTP is believed to occur by many processes, including the insertion of additional AMPA receptors, a kind of receptor that permits calcium ions to enter the cell, into the postsynaptic membrane. This increase in AMPA receptors permits the excitability of the postsynaptic neuron to rise, resulting in an increase in synaptic strength. Synaptic scaling is another example of how synapses may alter throughout the process of learning. Scaling of synapses is the process of adjusting the intensity of all synapses on a neuron to maintain a consistent degree of overall stimulation. This process may occur as a result of variations in brain activity, such as alterations in the number of neurons to which a neuron is attached. It is believed that this mechanism helps preserve the stability of neural networks, limiting runaway excitation and allowing for more accurate neuronal activity management. Various processes, including long-term potentiation and synaptic scaling, may cause synapses to alter during learning and memory. LTP is a permanent increase in synaptic strength that happens as a result of recurrent neuronal activation and is believed to underpin a variety of learning and memory processes. Multiple processes, including the insertion of additional AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane, are believed to be involved. Synaptic scaling is the process of adjusting the intensity of all synapses on a neuron to maintain a consistent overall level of excitation, hence contributing to the stability of neural networks.
