Changes in the strength of synapses, which are the connections between neurons, are involved in learning and memory. Synapses may alter via a variety of methods during learning and memory, including: Long-term potentiation (LTP) is a process that increases the strength of a synapse, increasing the likelihood that an action potential will be produced in the postsynaptic neuron. LTP is assumed to be a memory formation process. It is mediated by an increase in the number of receptors in the synapse, notably NMDA receptors. Long-term depression (LTD) is the inverse of LTP, in which synapse strength is reduced. LTD is hypothesized to have a function in learning by selectively weakening non-used synapses. It is caused by a reduction in the number of receptors, namely AMPA receptors, in the synapse. Synaptic scaling refers to the process of adjusting the intensity of all synapses on a cell to maintain a balance of excitement and inhibition. It is mediated by the activation of neurotransmitter receptors for glutamate and GABA. Synaptogenesis is the process through which new synapses are formed. This process happens predominantly during nervous system development, but it also occurs during learning and memory formation. These are examples of how synapses might alter during learning and memory, and each of these methods is mediated by a separate set of receptors and neurotransmitters. LTP and LTD, for example, both include the NMDA and AMPA receptors. Synaptogenesis, on the other hand, is characterized by the action of growth and neurotrophic factors that encourage the development of new synapses.
