Separate emotions are mediated by different brain circuits, according to a growing amount of data from neuroscience studies. For example, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that distinct areas of the brain are active when a person feels various emotions such as fear, pleasure, and anger. One research discovered that when participants watched scary expressions, the amygdala, a brain area known to be involved in emotion processing, was more active than when they viewed neutral images. Similarly, when participants saw joyful smiles vs neutral ones, the ventral striatum, a brain area linked with reward, was shown to be more active. Another PET research discovered that various emotions were related with varied patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex, a brain region involved in decision making and emotional control. Furthermore, research on individuals with brain injuries have shown that various brain circuits mediate different emotions. Patients with amygdala injury, for example, have difficulties identifying and reacting to frightened faces, while patients with ventral striatum damage have difficulty perceiving pleasure. Overall, the findings imply that various emotions are regulated by separate brain circuits and that certain brain areas are engaged in the processing of specific emotions.
