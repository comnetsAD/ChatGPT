Neuroimaging and lesion studies reveal various brain networks influence emotions. fMRI research have demonstrated that various emotions activate distinct brain areas. The amygdala activates in reaction to fear and anger, whereas the ventromedial prefrontal cortex activates in response to pleasure and satisfaction. Lesion experiments have also shown that various brain circuits mediate different emotions. For instance, those with amygdala injury have trouble feeling fear and other negative emotions, whereas those with ventromedial prefrontal cortex damage have trouble feeling happy emotions.
