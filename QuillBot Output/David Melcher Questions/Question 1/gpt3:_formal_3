Neuroimaging studies indicate that various brain circuits are engaged in response to certain emotions. For instance, the amygdala is highly aroused in reaction to negative emotions like as fear and anxiety, while the ventral striatum is stimulated in response to pleasant emotions such as pleasure. In addition, there is evidence that injury to certain brain areas might result in particular emotional deficiencies, such as a lack of fear reactions after damage to the amygdala. In addition, research have shown that various emotions are processed in distinct regions of the brain, with fear being processed in the amygdala and pleasure and happiness in the ventral striatum. This supports the theory that various emotions are mediated by unique brain circuits.
