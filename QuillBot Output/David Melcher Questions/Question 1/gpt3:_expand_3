Research using neuroimaging techniques has produced data suggesting that various brain circuits are engaged in response to a variety of emotions. For instance, the amygdala has robust activation in response to negative emotions like as fear and anxiety, while the ventral striatum experiences activation in reaction to pleasant emotions such as pleasure. In addition, there is evidence that injury to certain parts of the brain might lead to particular emotional deficiencies. For example, there is evidence that damage to the amygdala can result in a lack of fear reactions. In addition, research has shown that the parts of the brain responsible for processing certain emotions are distinct from one another. For example, the amygdala is responsible for processing fear, while the ventral striatum is responsible for processing pleasure and happiness. This lends credence to the theory that unique brain circuits are responsible for mediating the various emotions.
