Research in the field of neuroscience is accumulating more and more data that points to various brain circuits being responsible for the processing of different emotions. For instance, research conducted using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown that various areas of the brain become active whenever a person is subjected to a variety of emotions, such as pleasure, fear, and rage. Participants' amygdalae, an area of the brain known to be involved in the processing of emotion, were found to be more active when they watched scary faces than when they viewed neutral images, according to the findings of one research. A similar finding was made regarding the ventral striatum, which is an area of the brain connected with the feeling of reward. Researchers discovered that it was more active when individuals watched joyful images as opposed to neutral ones. Another research that made use of positron emission tomography (PET) came to the conclusion that various states of mind are linked to distinct patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex of the brain. This region of the brain is responsible for decision making as well as the control of emotions. In addition, research conducted on individuals who had brain injuries has revealed evidence that separate brain circuits are responsible for the mediation of various emotions. For instance, it has been shown that patients who have suffered damage to the amygdala have a difficult time identifying and reacting to scary faces, but patients who have suffered damage to the ventral striatum have a difficult time feeling pleasure. The findings of these research imply, on the whole, that unique brain circuits are responsible for the mediation of different emotions, and that certain areas of the brain are engaged in the processing of a variety of emotional states.
