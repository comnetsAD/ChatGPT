Neuroimaging studies have shown evidence that various brain circuits are active in response to various emotions. For instance, the ventral striatum is active in reaction to pleasant emotions like pleasure, but the amygdala is substantially stimulated in response to fear and anxiety. The lack of fear responses after amygdala injury is one example of how distinct emotional deficiencies may result from brain damage to certain brain areas. Additionally, research has shown that different emotions are processed in various parts of the brain. For instance, the amygdala processes fear, while the ventral striatum processes pleasure and joy. This bolsters the notion that various brain circuits mediate various emotions.
