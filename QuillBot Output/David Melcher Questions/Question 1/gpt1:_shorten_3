Neuroscience research is showing that various emotions are mediated by different brain circuits. fMRI studies have demonstrated that fear, pleasure, and anger activate distinct brain areas. In one research, individuals' amygdalas were more active when they saw frightened faces than neutral ones. Happy faces activated the ventral striatum, a reward-related brain area, more than neutral ones. Another PET research indicated that various emotions correlated with distinct prefrontal cortex activity, which regulates decision-making and emotion. Brain lesions have also shown that various brain circuits mediate different emotions. Patients with injury to the amygdala and ventral striatum have trouble identifying and reacting to frightened faces and feeling pleasure, respectively. These findings demonstrate that various brain circuits and brain areas handle different emotions.
