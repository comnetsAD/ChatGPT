Research in the field of neuroscience is accumulating evidence that various emotions are mediated by unique brain circuits. For instance, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that distinct areas of the brain are active when a person feels certain emotions, such as fear, pleasure, and anger. The amygdala, a brain area associated with emotion processing, was more active when participants watched scary faces than when they viewed neutral images, according to one research. Similarly, the ventral striatum, a reward-related brain area, was more active when individuals saw joyful faces as opposed to neutral ones. Another research utilizing positron emission tomography (PET) discovered that various emotions are linked with distinct patterns of activity in the prefrontal cortex, the region of the brain responsible for decision-making and emotional control. In addition, research on individuals with brain injuries has shown that unique brain circuits mediate different emotions. For instance, individuals with amygdala injury have difficulties identifying and reacting to frightened faces, while patients with ventral striatum damage have difficulty perceiving pleasure. The findings of these research imply that various emotions are mediated by unique brain circuits and that certain brain areas are engaged in the processing of specific emotions.
