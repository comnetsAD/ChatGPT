Various brain circuits indeed mediate different emotions, according to data from neuroimaging and lesion investigations. For example, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that various areas of the brain are active in response to different emotions. The amygdala, for example, responds to negative emotions like fear and wrath, while the ventromedial prefrontal cortex responds to good emotions like pleasure and satisfaction. Furthermore, lesion studies, which entail investigating people who have had particular brain areas damaged, have shown evidence for unique brain circuits controlling various emotions. Persons with amygdala injury, for example, have difficulties feeling fear and other unpleasant emotions, while individuals with ventromedial prefrontal cortex damage have difficulty experiencing happy emotions.
