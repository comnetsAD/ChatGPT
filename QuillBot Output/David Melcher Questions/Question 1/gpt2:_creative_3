Different brain circuits indeed mediate various emotions, as shown by neuroimaging and lesion investigations. Studies utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), a kind of neuroimaging, have demonstrated, for instance, that distinct parts of the brain are active in response to various emotional states. The amygdala, for instance, lights up in reaction to negative emotions like fear and rage, whereas the ventromedial prefrontal cortex lights up in response to good emotions like pleasure and satisfaction. Evidence for separate brain circuits mediating various emotions has also been supplied by lesion studies, which examine people who have suffered damage to particular brain areas. Trauma to the amygdala has been linked to an inability to feel fear and other negative emotions, whereas injury to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex has been linked to an inability to feel pleasant emotions.
