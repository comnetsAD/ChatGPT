Neuroimaging research has shown that various emotional states activate distinct neural pathways in the brain. The amygdala, for instance, is highly active in negative emotions like fear and anxiety, while the ventral striatum is highly activated in good emotions like pleasure. The lack of fear reactions, for example, has been linked to injury to the amygdala, a part of the brain involved in emotional processing. Further research has shown that the amygdala is responsible for processing fear, whereas the ventral striatum is responsible for processing pleasure and joy. This is consistent with the theory that different parts of the brain are responsible for processing various emotions.
