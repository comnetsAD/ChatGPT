There is evidence that implies various brain circuits do in fact influence different emotions. This evidence comes from neuroimaging research as well as lesion investigations. For instance, neuroimaging studies that made use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have demonstrated that various parts of the brain become active in response to certain feelings. For instance, the amygdala becomes active in reaction to negative emotions like fear and wrath, while the ventromedial prefrontal cortex becomes active in response to good emotions like pleasure and satisfaction. Both of these regions are involved in the processing of feelings. Lesion studies, which include the examination of people who have suffered damage to certain parts of the brain, have also offered evidence for the existence of unique brain circuits that are responsible for mediating various emotions. It has been discovered, for instance, that persons with damage to the amygdala have a difficult time feeling fear and other negative emotions, while those with injury to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex have a difficult time experiencing happy emotions.
