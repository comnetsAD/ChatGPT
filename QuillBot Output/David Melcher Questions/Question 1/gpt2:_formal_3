Both neuroimaging and lesion investigations provide evidence that various brain circuits control different emotions. Various areas of the brain are active in response to different emotions, as shown by neuroimaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). For instance, the amygdala is affected by negative emotions such as fear and wrath, while the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is stimulated by good emotions such as pleasure and satisfaction. In addition, lesion studies, which examine people who have incurred damage to particular brain areas, have offered evidence for the existence of discrete brain circuits that mediate various emotions. Injury to the amygdala has been associated with trouble feeling fear and other negative emotions, while damage to the ventromedial prefrontal cortex has been associated with problems experiencing happy emotions.
