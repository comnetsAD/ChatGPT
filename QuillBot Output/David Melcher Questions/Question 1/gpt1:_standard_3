Diverse brain circuits may act as various emotional mediators, according to a growing corpus of neuroscience research. As an example, research employing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown that various brain areas are active when a person feels various emotions, such as fear, pleasure, and rage. According to one research, seeing frightening faces caused the amygdala, a portion of the brain associated with processing emotions, to become more active than viewing neutral faces. Similarly, it was shown that participants' ventral striatum, a brain area linked to rewards, was more active while seeing joyful faces as opposed to neutral ones. The prefrontal cortex, a region of the brain involved in decision-making and emotional control, was shown to have distinct patterns of activity in another investigation utilizing positron emission tomography (PET). Additionally, research on individuals with brain damage has shown that specific brain circuits mediate the various emotions. Those with damage to the ventral striatum, for instance, have trouble feeling pleasure, whereas patients with injury to the amygdala have trouble recognizing and reacting to scary faces. Overall, the findings of these investigations point to the involvement of certain brain areas in the processing of particular emotions as well as the mediation of various emotions by various brain circuits.
