Neuroimaging and lesion investigations have provided evidence that different brain circuits indeed mediate various emotional states. For instance, research on neuroimaging utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown that various brain areas are active in response to certain emotions. For instance, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex is active in reaction to happy and contented feelings, while the amygdala is stimulated in response to negative emotions like fear and wrath. Additionally, lesion studies—which entail examining people who have suffered damage to certain brain regions—have shown evidence that separate brain circuits regulate various emotions. For instance, those who have amygdala injury have been reported to have trouble feeling fear and other negative emotions, but those who have ventromedial prefrontal cortex damage have trouble feeling happy emotions.
