Neuroimaging studies show that distinct brain circuits are engaged in response to different emotions. The amygdala, for example, is highly active in reaction to fear and anxiety, while the ventral striatum is highly stimulated in response to pleasant emotions such as pleasure. Furthermore, there is evidence that injury to certain brain areas might result in specific emotional deficiencies, such as a lack of fear reactions after amygdala damage. Furthermore, research have shown that various emotions are processed in distinct parts of the brain, such as fear in the amygdala and pleasure and happiness in the ventral striatum. This lends credence to the notion that various brain circuits govern different emotions.
