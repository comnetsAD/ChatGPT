Attention affects sensory processing by boosting the processing of pertinent stimuli and inhibiting the processing of irrelevant ones. This occurs through a variety of neuronal pathways. The regulation of neural gain, which relates to the magnitude of neuronal responses, is one approach. Attention may boost the gain of neurons that react to relevant stimuli, resulting in a bigger neural signal and a consequently enhanced capacity to identify and process that input. Attention may also bias the brain to recruit neurons that are more receptive to relevant stimuli by means of the selective recruitment of neuronal populations. This may occur through regulation of neural synchronization, whereby attention can improve the synchronization of neural activity among neurons that react to relevant inputs. In addition, attention influences sensory processing by modifying the information flow inside the brain. Attention may improve the flow of information from sensory regions to higher-order cognitive centers, allowing for more efficient processing of stimuli that are important. In addition to inhibiting the processing of irrelevant stimuli, attentional regulation of sensory processing also involves the suppression of irrelevant inputs. This may occur by inhibiting neuronal populations that react to irrelevant stimuli or by modulating the flow of information from irrelevant stimuli to higher-level cognitive centers. Overall, attention affects sensory processing through a complex and dynamic network of brain processes that cooperate to selectively increase the processing of relevant stimuli and inhibit the processing of irrelevant ones.
