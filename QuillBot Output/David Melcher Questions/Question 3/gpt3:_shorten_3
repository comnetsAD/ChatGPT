Attention increases neuronal activity in certain neural circuits and decreases it in others, modulating sensory processing. This lets a person ignore certain environmental factors. The major sensory cortices—visual, auditory, and somatosensory—may modulate neuronal activity. Focusing on a stimulus increases brain activity in the related primary sensory cortex and lowers activity in other main sensory cortices. Attentional control networks like the parietal and prefrontal cortices regulate basic sensory cortices. Attention also affects higher-level cognitive regions including the inferior temporal and ventral premotor cortices. These regions may pick pertinent primary sensory cortices input and prepare motor responses. The dorsal and ventral attention networks and their connections with main sensory and higher-level cognitive centers may also influence selective attention. The dorsal attention network, connected with the parietal cortex, controls voluntary attention, whereas the ventral attention network, associated with the temporal cortex, controls emotional salient stimuli. Through neural system and brain area connections, attention influences sensory processing by boosting neuronal activity in certain pathways and lowering it in others.
