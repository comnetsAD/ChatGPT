A key mechanism by which attention influences sensory processing is by the selective amplification or attenuation of neuronal activity along different neural pathways. Because of this, people may take in information from particular parts of their surroundings while ignoring other parts. The major sensory cortices, including those responsible for vision, hearing, and touch, may play a role in this through regulating neuronal activity. When a person pays close attention to a particular stimulus, the brain responds by increasing activity in the associated primary sensory cortex and decreasing activity in other cortices. It is believed that the parietal and prefrontal cortices, among others, play a mediating role here, exerting control over the main sensory cortices. As an added bonus, attention also affects brain activity in more complex regions like the inferior temporal and ventral premotor cortices. These regions are theorized to be responsible for filtering out irrelevant data from primary sensory cortices and gearing up for the most effective motor response. The dorsal and ventral attention networks, as well as their connections with primary sensory and higher-level cognitive centers, have been hypothesized to play a role in the regulation of selective attention. The parietal cortex and its related dorsal attention network are connected with the regulation of selective focus, whereas the temporal cortex and its ventral attention network are associated with the regulation of focus on emotionally relevant stimuli. As a whole, attention influences sensory processing by raising neuronal activity along certain routes while lowering it along others through the interplay of various neural systems and brain areas.
