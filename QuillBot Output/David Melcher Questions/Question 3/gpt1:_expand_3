The process of processing sensory information is modulated by attention, which selectively boosts the brain processing of specific stimuli while inhibiting the processing of other inputs. It is believed that this happens due to a variety of different brain pathways. The regulation of neuronal activity in early sensory cortices is one of the mechanisms via which attention influences the processing of sensory information. It has been shown that paying attention causes an increase in the rate of firing of neurons in the main visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices. This results in an improvement in the neural representation of attended stimuli. The manipulation of neuronal connections between early sensory cortices and higher-level cognitive areas, such as the prefrontal cortex, is another another method by which attention is able to influence the way in which the body processes sensory information. It has been shown that attention increases the functional connection between these areas, which enables more effective processing of attended stimuli. [Citation needed] In addition, attention modifies sensory processing by causing the release of neuromodulators like dopamine and acetylcholine. These neuromodulators have the ability to change the gain of neural circuits and the excitability of neurons in sensory areas, which in turn modifies the significance of the stimuli that are being perceived. In conclusion, attention is able to modulate sensory processing through a combination of neural mechanisms. These neural mechanisms include increased neural activity in early sensory cortices, increased functional connectivity between early sensory cortices and higher-level cognitive regions, and the release of neuromodulators that change the gain of neural circuits and alter the excitability of neurons in sensory areas.
