By selectively boosting the gain of neuronal activity in certain neural circuits while reducing the gain in others, attention modifies sensory processing. This enables a person to process some components of their surroundings selectively while ignoring others. The regulation of brain activity in the primary sensory cortices, such as the visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices, is one possible neural mechanism for this. The primary sensory cortex that corresponds to that input experiences an increase in neural activity, whereas other primary sensory cortices have a drop in activity. The parietal and prefrontal cortices, as well as other attentional control networks, are considered to have an impact on the primary sensory cortices, which is assumed to modulate this. The neuronal activity in higher-order cognitive regions like the inferior temporal and the ventral premotor cortices is also modulated by attention. These regions are believed to be involved in the preparation of appropriate motor responses and the selection of pertinent information from the main sensory cortices. The connection of several brain systems, including the dorsal and ventral attention networks and their interactions with the main sensory and higher-order cognitive regions, is also assumed to play a role in the regulation of selective attention. The ventral attention network, linked to the temporal cortex, is assumed to be involved in the regulation of attention to emotionally salient stimuli, while the dorsal attention network, linked to the parietal cortex, is thought to be involved in the control of voluntary attention. Overall, via the interplay between many neural systems and brain areas, attention modifies sensory processing by selectively enhancing neuronal activity in certain pathways while lowering it in others.
