The process of sensory processing is modulated by attention, which selectively boosts the gain of brain activity in some neural pathways while simultaneously lowering the gain in other neural pathways. This enables a person to selectively process some components of their surroundings while rejecting other aspects of the same environment. The regulation of neuronal activity in the main sensory cortices, such as the visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices, is one possible neurological mechanism that might be responsible for this. When a person concentrates their attention on a particular stimulus, the neural activity in the primary sensory cortex that is associated with that stimulus rises, while the activity in the activity in other primary sensory cortices drops. On the primary sensory cortices, it is assumed that this is mediated by the effect of attentional control networks, such as the parietal and prefrontal cortices. In addition to this, attention is responsible for modulating neuronal activity in higher-level cognitive regions such as the inferior temporal and ventral premotor cortices. It is believed that these regions are engaged in the process of selecting pertinent information from the main sensory cortices and in preparing an appropriate motor response. It is believed that the interaction between various neural systems, such as the dorsal and ventral attention networks, as well as their interactions with the primary sensory and higher-level cognitive areas, plays a role in the control of selective attention. Specifically, the dorsal and ventral attention networks. It is believed that the dorsal attention network, which is associated with the parietal cortex, is responsible for the control of attention that is given voluntarily, whereas the ventral attention network, which is associated with the temporal cortex, is believed to be responsible for the control of attention that is given to emotionally salient stimuli. In general, attention is able to modify sensory processing by selectively raising the level of neuronal activity in some pathways while simultaneously lowering it in others. This is accomplished via the connections between various neural systems and areas of the brain.
