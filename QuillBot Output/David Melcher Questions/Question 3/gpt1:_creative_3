One way in which attention influences perception is by causing some stimuli to be given more brain processing resources while others are suppressed. A variety of brain processes have been proposed to account for this. Modulation of neuronal activity in early sensory cortices is a technique through which attention influences sensory processing. Neurons in the main visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices have been found to increase their firing rate in response to an attended stimulus. The neuronal connection between early sensory cortices and higher-level cognitive areas like the prefrontal cortex is another method via which attention influences sensory processing. It has been established that paying attention increases functional connection between these areas, leading to more effective processing of attended stimuli. In addition to influencing the gain of neuronal circuits and the excitability of neurons in sensory regions, attention may also influence the salience of stimuli by releasing neuromodulators like dopamine and acetylcholine. Increased neural activity in early sensory cortices, enhanced functional connectivity between early sensory cortices and higher-level cognitive regions, and the release of neuromodulators that change the gain of neural circuits and alter the excitability of neurons in sensory areas are all examples of how attention can modulate sensory processing.
