By selectively boosting the processing of pertinent stimuli and decreasing the processing of unimportant ones, attention modifies sensory perception. There are many brain systems at work here. One method involves changing the neural gain, which is the amplitude of neural responses. The gain of neurons that react to pertinent stimuli may be increased by attention, resulting in a larger neural signal and a consequent improvement in the capacity to recognize and comprehend that input. Another process is selective neuronal population recruitment, wherein attention might lead the brain to favor the recruitment of neurons that are more receptive to relevant inputs. This may happen through altering neuronal synchronization, which involves paying more attention to the neurons' ability to coordinate their activity in response to pertinent inputs. Additionally, by changing the way information travels through the brain, attention also modifies sensory processing. In order to comprehend pertinent inputs more effectively, attention may enhance the flow of information from sensory centers to higher-level cognitive areas. Finally, the suppression of the processing of unimportant stimuli also contributes to attentional control of sensory processing. This may happen by inhibiting neuronal populations that are stimulated by irrelevant stimuli or by controlling the information flow from irrelevant stimuli to higher-order cognitive regions. The overall effect of attention is to selectively increase the processing of relevant stimuli and reduce the processing of irrelevant stimuli via a complex and dynamic network of brain processes.
