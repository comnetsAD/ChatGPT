Attention influences sensory processing by selectively promoting processing of important stimuli while decreasing processing of irrelevant ones. This is accomplished by a variety of neuronal pathways. The regulation of neural gain, which relates to the magnitude of neuronal responses, is one approach. Attention may boost the gain of neurons that react to relevant stimuli, resulting in a larger neural signal and, therefore, a higher capacity to identify and comprehend that input. Another process is selective neuronal population recruitment, in which attention may bias the brain to recruit neurons that are more receptive to relevant inputs. This may happen via neural synchronization modulation, in which attention increases the synchrony of brain activity among neurons that react to relevant inputs. Furthermore, focus modifies sensory processing by changing the flow of information through the brain. The flow of information from sensory centers to higher-level cognitive areas may be increased by paying attention, allowing for more efficient processing of important inputs. Finally, attentional regulation of sensory processing occurs via the suppression of irrelevant stimuli processing. This may be accomplished by inhibiting neuronal populations that react to irrelevant stimuli or by modulating information flow from irrelevant stimuli to higher-level cognitive centers. Overall, attention affects sensory processing through a complex and dynamic network of brain processes that collaborate to selectively increase processing of relevant stimuli while suppressing processing of irrelevant ones.
