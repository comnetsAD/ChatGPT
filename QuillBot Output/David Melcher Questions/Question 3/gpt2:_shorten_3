Attention enhances important stimuli and suppresses irrelevant inputs. Neural mechanisms do this. Brain gain—the magnitude of neural responses—can be modulated. Attention increases the gain of neurons that react to relevant stimuli, strengthening the neural signal and improving detection and processing. Attention may selectively recruit neuronal groups that respond better to relevant inputs. Attention may promote neuronal synchronization among relevant stimuli-responding neurons. Attention also affects brain information flow and sensory processing. Attention boosts sensory-to-cognitive information flow, making relevant stimuli easier to process. Finally, attentional regulation of sensory processing suppresses irrelevant inputs. Inhibiting neuronal populations that react to irrelevant stimuli or modulating information flow from irrelevant stimuli to higher-level cognitive centers may do this. Through a complex and dynamic collection of brain processes, attention selectively enhances important inputs and suppresses irrelevant ones.
