The processing of sensory information may be modulated by attention, which selectively amplifies the processing of pertinent stimuli while at the same time reducing the processing of irrelevant inputs. A variety of brain processes are responsible for this phenomenon. One process is the regulation of neural gain, which refers to the amplitude of neural responses. This is one way that this might happen. It is possible for attention to raise the gain of neurons that react to pertinent stimuli. This results in a larger neural signal and, as a result, a better capacity to identify and comprehend the stimulus in question. An additional approach is via the selective recruitment of neuronal populations. This is a process in which attention may influence the brain to recruit neurons that are more receptive to inputs that are relevant to the situation. This may take place as a result of the manipulation of neural synchronization, in which the process of paying attention might improve the synchronicity of brain activity among neurons that react to relevant inputs. In addition, attention alters the flow of information through the brain, which in turn modifies the way the brain processes sensory information. It is possible for attention to accelerate the flow of information from lower-level cognitive regions to higher-level cognitive areas, so enabling more effective processing of stimuli that are relevant. In conclusion, attentional regulation of sensory processing may also take place via the inhibition of the processing of inputs that are not relevant to the task at hand. This may take place either via the suppression of neuronal populations that react to irrelevant stimuli or by the manipulation of the flow of information from irrelevant stimuli to higher-level cognitive regions. Both of these mechanisms have the potential to bring about this result. In general, attention modifies sensory processing by means of a convoluted and ever-changing set of neural mechanisms that collaborate to selectively boost the processing of relevant stimuli while suppressing the processing of irrelevant stimuli. This effect is what we mean when we say that attention "modulates" sensory processing.
