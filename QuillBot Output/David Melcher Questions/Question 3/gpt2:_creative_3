Through selectively amplifying the processing of important stimuli and suppressing the processing of irrelevant stimuli, attention modifies sensory processing. Multiple brain pathways contribute to this effect. Amplitude, or "gain," in brain responses is one variable that may be adjusted. By focusing on a particular stimulus, the brain's neurons that react to it will get a stronger signal, allowing them to better identify and understand it. The brain may also be influenced by attention in order to act in a certain way, and this can be done via the selective recruitment of neuronal populations, which favors the recruitment of neurons that are more receptive to the stimuli of interest. Attention may improve the synchronicity of neuronal activity among neurons that react to relevant stimuli, which can lead to this effect. In addition, focus modifies sensory processing by changing how the brain receives and processes information. By directing one's focus on a specific stimulus, one's brain is better able to analyze that stimulus and go on to the next one. Attentional regulation of sensory processing also occurs via the suppression of processing of irrelevant inputs. This may happen when some neuronal populations are inhibited from responding to irrelevant stimuli, or when the flow of information from irrelevant stimuli is modified before it reaches higher-level cognitive centers. Attention is able to selectively boost the processing of important stimuli while suppressing the processing of irrelevant stimuli via a dynamic and complicated collection of brain processes.
