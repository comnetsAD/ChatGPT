By selectively boosting certain stimuli's brain processing while inhibiting others, attention modifies sensory perception. It is believed that a variety of brain processes are at work here. One way that attention affects sensory processing is via altering the neuronal activity in the early sensory cortices. The neural representation of attended stimuli is improved by attention, which has been demonstrated to increase the firing rate of neurons in primary visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices. Another way that attention affects sensory processing is through altering the neuronal connections between lower-level cognitive areas like the prefrontal cortex and early sensory cortices. It has been shown that attention increases the functional connection between these areas, enabling more effective processing of attended stimuli. Additionally, attention modifies sensory processing by releasing neuromodulators like dopamine and acetylcholine, which may modify the excitability of sensory neurons and change the gain of neural circuits, so altering the salience of the stimuli. In conclusion, attention modulates sensory processing via a number of neural mechanisms, including an increase in neural activity in early sensory cortices, an increase in functional connectivity between early sensory cortices and higher-level cognitive regions, and the release of neuromodulators that modify the gain of neural circuits and the excitability of neurons in sensory areas.
