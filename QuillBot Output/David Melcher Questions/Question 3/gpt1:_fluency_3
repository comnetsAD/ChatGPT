Attention influences sensory processing by selectively increasing neural processing of some inputs while decreasing neural processing of others. This is hypothesized to happen through a variety of neuronal pathways. The regulation of neuronal activity in early sensory cortices is one method by which attention impacts sensory processing. Attention has been found to raise the firing rate of neurons in the main visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices, hence improving neuronal representation of attended stimuli. Another way attention influences sensory processing is via altering neuronal connections between early sensory cortices and higher-level cognitive areas like the prefrontal cortex. It has been shown that attention increases functional connection between these areas, allowing for more effective processing of attended stimuli. Furthermore, attention influences sensory processing by releasing neuromodulators such as dopamine and acetylcholine, which may affect the gain of neuronal circuits and alter the excitability of neurons in sensory regions, so regulating the salience of inputs. In summary, attention modulates sensory processing via a variety of neural mechanisms, including increased neural activity in early sensory cortices, increased functional connectivity between early sensory cortices and higher-level cognitive regions, and the release of neuromodulators that alter neural circuit gain and neuron excitability in sensory areas.
