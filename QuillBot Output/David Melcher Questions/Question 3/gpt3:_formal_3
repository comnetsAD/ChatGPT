Attention influences sensory processing by raising the gain of neuronal activity in some neural pathways and reducing it in others. This enables a person to selectively process some environmental variables while ignoring others. The regulation of brain activity in the main sensory cortices, such as the visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices, is one putative neural mechanism for this. When a person concentrates their attention on a particular stimulus, brain activity in the relevant primary sensory cortex rises while activity in the other main sensory cortices drops. It is believed that attentional control networks, such as the parietal and prefrontal cortices, exert an impact on the main sensory cortices. In addition, attention influences neuronal activity in higher-order cognitive regions, including the inferior temporal and ventral premotor cortices. These regions are believed to be responsible for selecting pertinent information from the main sensory cortices and producing an appropriate motor response. It is believed that the regulation of selective attention involves the interaction of several brain systems, such as the dorsal and ventral attention networks, as well as their connections with the main sensory and higher-order cognitive regions. It is believed that the dorsal attention network, which is connected with the parietal cortex, controls voluntary attention, and the ventral attention network, which is related with the temporal cortex, controls attention to emotionally relevant stimuli. Overall, attention controls sensory processing by selectively boosting neuronal activity in some pathways and lowering it in others, mediated via the connections between various neural systems and brain areas.
