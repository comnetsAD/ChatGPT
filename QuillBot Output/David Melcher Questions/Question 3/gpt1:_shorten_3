Attention enhances brain processing of certain inputs and suppresses others. Neural pathways may cause this. Attention regulates neuronal activity in early sensory cortices. Attention increases cell activity in primary visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices, improving neuronal representation of attended inputs. Attention regulates neuronal connections between early sensory cortices and higher-level cognitive areas like the prefrontal cortex. Attention improves stimulus processing by increasing functional connections between these areas. Attention releases neuromodulators like dopamine and acetylcholine, which influence neural circuit gain and sensory neuron excitability, regulating stimulus salience. In summary, attention influences sensory processing via increased neuronal activity in early sensory cortices, greater functional connectivity between them and higher-level cognitive regions, and the release of neuromodulators that modify neural circuit gain and sensory cell excitability.
