Attention modifies sensory processing by selectively enhancing neuronal activity gain in some neural pathways while lowering gain in others. This enables a person to process some components of the environment while ignoring others. Modulation of neuronal activity in primary sensory cortices such as the visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices is one putative neurological mechanism for this. When a person concentrates their attention on a single stimulus, brain activity rises in the relevant primary sensory cortex while decreasing in other main sensory cortices. This is assumed to be mediated through the effect of attentional control networks on the main sensory cortices, such as the parietal and prefrontal cortices. Furthermore, attention influences neuronal activity in higher-level cognitive regions such the inferior temporal and ventral premotor cortices. These regions are hypothesized to be involved in the selection of relevant information from the primary sensory cortices as well as the preparation of suitable motor responses. Controlling selective attention is also assumed to include the interaction of several brain systems, such as the dorsal and ventral attention networks, as well as their connections with primary sensory and higher-level cognitive regions. The dorsal attention network, connected with the parietal cortex, is assumed to govern voluntary attention, while the ventral attention network, associated with the temporal cortex, is thought to control attention to emotionally salient stimuli. Overall, attention modifies sensory processing by selectively raising neuronal activity in some pathways while lowering it in others through interactions between distinct neural systems and brain regions.
