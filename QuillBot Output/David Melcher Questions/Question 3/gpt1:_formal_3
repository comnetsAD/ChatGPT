Attention affects sensory processing by boosting the neuronal processing of some stimuli and inhibiting the processing of others. This is believed to occur through a variety of neuronal pathways. The regulation of neuronal activity in early sensory cortices is one of the mechanisms through which attention influences sensory processing. It has been shown that attention increases the firing rate of neurons in the main visual, auditory, and somatosensory cortices, hence improving the neural representation of attended stimuli. Through the manipulation of neuronal connections between early sensory cortices and higher-level cognitive areas, such as the prefrontal cortex, attention also impacts sensory processing. It has been shown that attention increases the functional connection between these brain areas, allowing for more effective processing of attended inputs. In addition, attention influences sensory processing through the production of neuromodulators like as dopamine and acetylcholine, which may modify the gain of neuronal circuits and the excitability of neurons in sensory regions, so changing the salience of the inputs. In conclusion, attention modulates sensory processing through a variety of neural mechanisms, including increased neural activity in early sensory cortices, increased functional connectivity between early sensory cortices and higher-level cognitive regions, and the release of neuromodulators that alter the gain of neural circuits and the excitability of neurons in sensory areas.
