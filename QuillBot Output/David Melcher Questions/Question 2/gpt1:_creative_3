Any demand or danger causes the body to react with stress. It may be of a physical nature, such as an accident or disease, or of a mental one, such as issues at work or in personal relationships. The fundamental difference between acute and chronic stress is how long its effects last. Acute stress is the typical, temporary reaction to a current challenge. It may be useful since it improves our ability to respond rapidly to threats. However, prolonged stress, or chronic stress, may have serious consequences for our physical and mental health. It is difficult to simplify the architecture and function of the two-way communication between the neurological system and the immune system under normal conditions and under stress. The immune system and the neurological system coordinate their activities during rest to keep the body in a state of homeostasis, or equilibrium. In response to stress, the body releases hormones from the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and adrenal glands, known as the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline are then secreted in response, which may have an adverse effect on the immune system. By producing immune-modifying molecules, the immune system may interact with the neurological system and affect the stress response by modulating the activity of the HPA axis and the sympathetic nervous system. In conclusion, stress is a natural and healthy reaction to certain circumstances, but it may have harmful consequences on the body if it persists over time. Even while stress may throw the body's delicate balance off, the immune system and neurological system have a two-way conversation that's crucial to health.
