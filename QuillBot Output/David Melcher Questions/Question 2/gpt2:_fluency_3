Stress is a condition of tension or physical, mental, or emotional pressure brought on by difficult or demanding conditions. Acute stress and chronic stress are the key differences between the two forms of stress that were discussed in class. A vehicle accident or a job interview are two examples of sudden demands or dangers that might lead to acute stress, which is short-term stress. Chronic stress, which includes continuing work-related stress or a challenging relationship, is long-term stress that lasts for a long time. The neurological system and the immune system interact via a complex network of signaling pathways, which is the anatomy and function of BI-DIRECTIONALITY of communication between the two systems at rest and under stress. When the body is at rest, this communication is generally in balance, with the immune system receiving signals from the neurological system to support homeostasis, or equilibrium. However, while under stress, the immune system may be suppressed by stress hormones like cortisol and adrenaline released by the neurological system. Inflammatory chemicals released by the immune system, on the other hand, may connect with the neurological system in a way that exacerbates the stress response by activating the sympathetic nervous system. In order to maintain the body's overall health and wellbeing, the nervous and immune systems must communicate back and forth. However, when the stress response is chronic, it can have a detrimental impact on both physical and mental health and result in a number of diseases, including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and depression.
