The body's reaction to any demand or danger is stress. It might be physical, such as an accident or sickness, or psychological, such as issues at work or in relationships. Acute stress and chronic stress are the primary distinctions between the two forms of stress. Acute stress is the body's typical, short-term reaction to a particular demand or danger. It may be advantageous since it allows us to respond swiftly to danger. Chronic stress, on the other hand, refers to long-term stress that might harm our bodily and mental health. The structure and function of bidirectional communication between the neurological system and the immune system at rest and during stress are complicated. At rest, the immune system and nervous system collaborate to keep the body in homeostasis, or balance. When stressed, the sympathetic nervous system and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis are activated. This causes the production of stress chemicals like cortisol and adrenaline, which suppresses the immune system. The immune system, on the other hand, may interact with the neurological system by producing immune-modulating molecules that alter the activity of the HPA axis and the sympathetic nervous system, so influencing the stress response. In conclusion, stress may be a natural and healthy reaction to some conditions, but prolonged stress can be harmful to the body. The immune system and neurological system interact bidirectionally, which is necessary for maintaining bodily homeostasis, but stress may disturb this equilibrium.
