An individual's body goes through a state of stress in reaction to an actual or imagined danger. Hormones like adrenaline and cortisol are secreted in response to stress, setting off the body's "fight or flight" reaction. Acute stress and chronic stress are both real phenomena. Acute stress is a temporary reaction to an immediate threat or demand, such as an important presentation or a trying circumstance. On the other side, chronic stress is the kind of stress that persists over time due to persistent aggravations in one's environment, such as a demanding work or a tense personal relationship. There is two-way contact between the neurological system and the immune system, which allows for mutual influence between the two. As the body relaxes, the neurological system communicates with the immune system to keep everything in check and the body healthy. When confronted with a perceived danger, the neurological system sends signals to the immune system to ramp up inflammation and activate immune cells. The immune system is able to alter the body's reaction to stress by sending signals to the neurological system. Simply put, stress is an immediate or persistent physiological reaction to a perceived danger or challenge. Both the immune system and the neurological system may influence the other.
