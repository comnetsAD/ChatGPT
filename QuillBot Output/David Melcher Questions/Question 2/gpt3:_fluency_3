A physiological reaction to a perceived danger or challenge is stress. The production of stress hormones such as adrenaline and cortisol activates the body's stress response, commonly known as the "fight or flight" reaction. Acute stress and chronic stress are the two forms of stress. Acute stress is a brief reaction to a single event, such as delivering a presentation or coping with a challenging circumstance. Chronic stress, on the other hand, is long-term stress caused by continuing obstacles or unpleasant living situations, such as a demanding work or a challenging relationship. The neurological system and the immune system communicate bidirectionally, which means that both systems may impact one other. When the body is at rest, the nervous system sends signals to the immune system in order to maintain balance and keep the body healthy. In response to a perceived danger, the brain system sends signals to the immune system to raise inflammation and activate immune cells. The immune system also sends messages to the neurological system to alter stress perception and the body's reaction. In conclusion, stress is a physiological reaction to a perceived danger or challenge that might be immediate or persistent. The neurological system and the immune system communicate bidirectionally, with the immune system influencing the nervous system and the nervous system influencing the immunological system.
