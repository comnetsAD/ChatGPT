Demands and threats cause stress. It can be physical, like injury or illness, or psychological, like work or relationship issues. Acute and chronic stress are the key differences. Normal, short-term stress is acute stress. It aids in emergency response. However, chronic stress can harm our mental and physical health. The immune and nervous systems maintain homeostasis (balance) at rest. Stress stimulates the sympathetic nervous system and HPA axis. Cortisol and adrenaline are released, suppressing the immune system. The immune system releases immune-modulating chemicals that affect the HPA axis and sympathetic nervous system, affecting stress response. In conclusion, stress might be good in particular conditions, but prolonged stress can harm the body. Stress may disturb the immune system-nervous system bidirectional connection, which maintains physiological homeostasis.
