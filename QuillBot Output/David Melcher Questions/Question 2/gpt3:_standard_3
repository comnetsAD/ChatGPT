Stress is a bodily reaction to a perceived danger or difficulty. The production of stress hormones like adrenaline and cortisol triggers the body's stress response, commonly referred to as the "fight or flight" reaction. Acute stress and chronic stress are the two different forms of stress. Acute stress is a rapid reaction to a particular event, such making a presentation or handling a challenging circumstance. Contrarily, chronic stress is long-term stress brought on by persistent problems or challenging conditions in life, such as a demanding work or a challenging relationship. Both the neurological and immunological systems may impact one another because of the bidirectional connection that exists between them. When the body is at rest, the nervous system communicates with the immune system to keep things in check and keep the body healthy. When under stress, the immune system is signaled to raise inflammation and activate immune cells in order to defend against the perceived danger. The nervous system receives messages from the immune system that alter how stress is perceived and how the body reacts. In conclusion, stress is a physiological reaction that may be either immediate or persistent to perceived danger or challenge. The immune system may influence the nervous system, and the neurological system can influence the immune system, since there is bidirectional contact between the two systems.
