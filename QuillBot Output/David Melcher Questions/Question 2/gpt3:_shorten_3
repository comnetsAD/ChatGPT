Threats or challenges cause stress. Adrenaline and cortisol trigger the "fight or flight" stress response. Acute and chronic stress exist. Acute stress is a short-term reaction to an event like a presentation or a challenging scenario. Chronic stress, on the other hand, is long-term stress caused by continuing problems like a stressful work or a bad relationship. The immune and neurological systems communicate bidirectionally. At rest, the nervous system instructs the immune system to preserve balance and health. Stress triggers the immune system to produce inflammation and activate immunological cells. The immune system stimulates the neurological system to alter stress perception and response. In conclusion, acute or chronic stress is a physiological reaction to perceived danger or challenge. The immune system and neurological system communicate both ways.
