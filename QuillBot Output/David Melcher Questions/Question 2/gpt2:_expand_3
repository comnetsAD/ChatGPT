A condition of mental, bodily, or emotional strain or tension that is brought on by circumstances that are seen as being either unfavorable or demanding is what we refer to as stress. The difference between acute stress and chronic stress is the primary contrast between the two forms of stress that were discussed in class. Acute stress is a kind of short-term stress that is brought on by urgent demands or threats, such as being in a vehicle accident or going on an interview for a new job. Chronic stress is stress that lasts for an extended length of time and may be caused by a variety of factors, including chronic stress at work or in a relationship as well as other challenging situations. The anatomy and function of BI-DIRECTIONALITY of communication between the nervous system and the immune system at rest and in the face of stress is that the nervous system and the immune system communicate through an intricate network of signaling pathways. This is true both in the absence of stress and in the presence of stress. The neurological system sends messages to the immune system in order to create a state of homeostasis, also known as balance, while the body is at rest. This communication is reasonably balanced. However, when faced with stress, this equilibrium is thrown off, resulting in the release of stress hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline by the neurological system. These chemicals have the potential to inhibit the immune system. On the other hand, the immune system has the ability to signal back to the nervous system via the production of inflammatory chemicals. This activation of the sympathetic nervous system may further intensify the effects of the stress response. When stress response is chronic, it can have negative effects on physical and mental health, leading to various diseases such as cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and depression. This bidirectional communication between the nervous and immune systems is important for maintaining the overall health and well-being of the body.
