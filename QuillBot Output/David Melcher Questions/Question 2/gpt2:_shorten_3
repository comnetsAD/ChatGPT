Stress is physical, mental, or emotional pressure caused by difficult conditions. Acute and chronic stress are the key differences in class. Acute stress comes from sudden demands or hazards, such a vehicle accident or a job interview. Work-related or interpersonal stress may lead to chronic stress. A complex network of signaling channels connects the neurological and immune systems at rest and during stress. The neural system tells the immune system to maintain homeostasis during rest. However, stress disrupts the equilibrium by generating cortisol and adrenaline, which inhibit the immune system. However, the immune system may produce inflammatory chemicals to stimulate the sympathetic nervous system and worsen the stress response. This bidirectional connection between the neurological and immune systems is vital to the body's health, but chronic stress response may lead to disorders including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and depression.
