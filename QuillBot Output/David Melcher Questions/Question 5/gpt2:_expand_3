Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disturbance is one kind of attention disorder (ADHD). Inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity are all symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Those who suffer from attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) often struggle to focus on a single task for any length of time. It's also possible they have trouble sitting still, are constantly interrupting people, and act on impulse rather than carefully considering their actions. However, studies have shown that a number of different brain areas and neuronal systems may be impacted by ADHD. The prefrontal cortex, which is responsible for attentional control and decision making, and the parietal cortex, which is responsible for directing attention and spatial processing, both exhibit decreased activity in people with ADHD, according to imaging studies. There's also evidence that the systems of neurotransmitters dopamine and norepinephrine, which control things like focus and drive, aren't working properly. Multiple genes have been associated to ADHD, including those involved in the development of brain areas known to be involved in attentional control and those involved in the regulation of dopamine and norepinephrine transmission. In summary, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is an attention disorder characterized by inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, and affecting several neural systems and brain areas.
