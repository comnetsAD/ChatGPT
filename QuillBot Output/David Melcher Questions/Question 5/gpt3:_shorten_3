ADHD causes inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Inattention causes issues paying attention, organizing, avoiding mental work, losing things, being quickly sidetracked, and forgetting. Hyperactivity causes fidgeting, difficulties sitting, frequent chatting, and interrupting. Impulsivity includes acting without thinking, impatience, and interrupting. ADHD may be caused by malfunction in neuronal networks that govern attention and impulse control, according to studies. The prefrontal cortex controls executive processes including attention, working memory, and impulse control, whereas the striatum controls reward processing and impulse control. These networks may impede the capacity to filter out distractions, concentrate, and suppress urges, causing inattention and impulsivity. The frontostriatal circuit, which links the prefrontal cortex and the striatum, is also dysfunctional in ADHD patients. ADHD may also be hereditary and linked to brain dopamine modulation. Dopamine controls attention, motivation, and reward. Thus, aberrant dopamine regulation may impair attention and impulsive control. ADHD is a condition of attention that causes inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity due to neural network malfunction and aberrant dopamine modulation.
