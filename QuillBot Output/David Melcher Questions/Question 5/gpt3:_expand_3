A problem of attention known as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Inattention may manifest itself in a variety of ways, including the following symptoms: problems paying attention to details, difficulty with organization, avoiding jobs that require prolonged mental work, forgetfulness, forgetting things, and being easily distracted. Fidgeting, trouble keeping sitting, excessive chatting, and interrupting others are some of the symptoms of hyperactivity. Impulsivity manifests itself in a variety of ways, the most common of which include acting without thinking, impatience, and interrupting others. The precise brain processes that are involved in ADHD are not completely known; however, research shows that it may entail disruption in the neural networks that govern attention and impulse control. ADD stands for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. The prefrontal cortex, which is involved in executive functions such as attention, working memory, and impulse control, and the striatum, which is involved in reward processing and impulse control, are both included in these networks. Executive functions include attention, working memory, and impulse control. A dysfunction in these networks may result in a decreased capacity to filter out distractions, retain concentration, and regulate impulses, which may lead to symptoms of inattention and impulsivity. Symptoms of inattention and impulsivity include acting without thinking and being easily distracted. In addition, research has shown that people who have ADHD have aberrant brain activity in regions of the brain that are related with attention and impulse control. One example of these regions is the frontostriatal circuit, which is a network that links the prefrontal cortex and the striatum. Studies have shown that there may be a genetic component to ADHD, and that it may be connected with faulty dopamine control in the brain. It has also been proposed that there may be a genetic component to ADHD. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that is involved in a number of important processes, including attention, motivation, and the experience of reward. As a result, problems with attention and the ability to regulate one's impulses may be caused by aberrant regulation of dopamine. In general, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a disorder of attention that is characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. It is believed that ADHD is caused by a dysfunction in the neural networks that control attention and impulse control, as well as abnormal dopamine regulation.
