The ailment known as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a condition that is characterized by symptoms like impulsivity, hyperactivity, and a lack of attention. Inattention is characterized by symptoms such as trouble concentrating, staying organized, and finishing activities, as well as forgetfulness and disarray. Fidgeting, restlessness, and an inability to sit still are all behaviors that might be indicators of hyperactivity. Acting without giving thought to the consequences, interrupting others, and having a difficult time waiting one's turn are all symptoms of impulsivity. It is believed that a combination of hereditary and environmental variables are responsible for the development of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is linked to malfunction in a number of brain areas and neural networks. These include the prefrontal cortex, which is believed to be involved in the control of attention as well as the regulation of impulsive behaviors, the basal ganglia, which is believed to be involved in the regulation of motor activity, and the cerebellum, which is believed to be involved in the coordination of motor behaviors. Imaging studies have demonstrated that people who have ADHD have abnormalities in the functional connectivity and activity of the dopamine and norepinephrine systems. These abnormalities have been proven to contribute to the symptoms of ADHD. These systems are very important in terms of their contribution to the control of attention, motivation, and the processing of rewards. In general, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. It is believed that ADHD is caused by dysfunction in multiple regions and neural networks of the brain, including the prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, as well as the dopamine and norepinephrine systems.
