ADHD is an attentional disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Inattention is characterized by difficulties with paying attention to details, organizing, avoiding activities requiring prolonged mental effort, losing things, being easily distracted, and forgetting. Symptoms of hyperactivity include fidgeting, trouble maintaining a sitting position, frequent chatting, and interrupting others. Impulsivity is characterized by acting without reflection, impatience, and interrupting others. ADHD is characterized by a disturbance in the neural networks that regulate attention and impulse control, according to study. However, the precise brain processes involved are not entirely known. The prefrontal cortex is engaged in executive tasks such as attention, working memory, and impulse control, whereas the striatum is involved in reward processing and impulse control. The inability to filter out distractions, retain concentration, and suppress impulses may be hampered if these networks are dysfunctional, leading to symptoms of inattention and impulsivity. In addition, research indicates that persons with ADHD have aberrant brain activity in regions related with attention and impulse control, such as the frontostriatal circuit, a network connecting the prefrontal cortex and the striatum. Some studies have also shown that ADHD may have a hereditary component and be connected with an aberrant control of dopamine in the brain. Dopamine is an essential neurotransmitter for attention, motivation, and reward. Therefore, improper dopamine regulation may result in attention and impulse control issues. Overall, ADHD is an attention disorder defined by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, and it is believed to be caused by disruption in the brain networks that regulate attention and impulse control, as well as aberrant dopamine modulation.
