A disturbance of attention is, for instance, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Symptoms of ADHD include inattention or the inability to sustain attention for a prolonged length of time, impulsivity, and hyperactivity. Individuals with ADHD may struggle to complete activities and adhere to directions, and they may be easily distracted. In addition, they may have difficulties sitting still and be prone to interrupting others or behaving rashly without consideration. Research shows that a number of brain areas and neural systems may be impacted by ADHD, however the precise brain processes underlying ADHD are not entirely known. The prefrontal cortex, which is involved in attentional regulation and decision making, and the parietal cortex, which is involved in orienting attention and spatial processing, are less active in persons with ADHD, according to imaging studies. In addition, there is evidence of aberrant functioning of the neurotransmitter systems dopamine and norepinephrine, which regulate attention and motivation. Multiple genes have been associated to ADHD, including those involved in the regulation of dopamine and norepinephrine transmission, as well as those involved in the development of brain areas believed to be involved in attentional control. ADHD is a disorder of attention characterized by symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, with several neural systems and brain areas being involved.
