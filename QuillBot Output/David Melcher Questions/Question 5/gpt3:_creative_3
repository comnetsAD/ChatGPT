Symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity are characteristic of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Inattention manifests itself in a variety of ways, including a failure to focus, disorganization, aversion to activities that need prolonged concentration, a propensity to lose things, a lack of memory, and an ease with distractions. Hyperactive behavior manifests itself in a variety of ways, including but not limited to the aforementioned interruption of others, excessive speech, and inability to sit still. Acting on impulse, being impatient, and interrupting others are all signs of impulsivity. Research shows that disruption in the neuronal networks that govern attention and impulse control may be implicated with ADHD, albeit this yet to be definitively established. The prefrontal cortex and the striatum are both part of these networks; the former is responsible for executive processes like attention and the latter for working memory and impulse control. Irregularities in these networks have been linked to symptoms of impulsivity and lack of attention. Studies have also shown that people with ADHD have aberrant activity in the frontostriatal circuit, a network that links the prefrontal cortex and the striatum and is involved in attention and impulse control. Some research has linked faulty dopamine control in the brain to ADHD, suggesting a hereditary component to the disorder. Dopamine is a key neurotransmitter involved in cognition and behavior associated with focus, motivation, and reward. As a result, issues with attention and self-control may develop as a result of aberrant dopamine modulation. Symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity are all hallmarks of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), which is considered to be caused by aberrant dopamine modulation and disruption in the brain networks that regulate attention and impulse control.
