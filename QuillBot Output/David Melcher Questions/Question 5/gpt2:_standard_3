Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Issue is one kind of attention disorder (ADHD). ADHD symptoms include impulsivity, hyperactivity, and trouble paying attention or keeping it for long periods of time. People who have ADHD may struggle to finish activities, carry out instructions, and may get easily sidetracked. Additionally, they could have trouble staying quiet, be prone to interrupting others, or behave rashly without thinking. Research indicates that a number of brain areas and neurological systems may be disrupted, yet the precise brain processes causing ADHD are not yet completely known. According to imaging studies, people with ADHD have decreased activity in the prefrontal cortex, which regulates attention and decision-making, as well as in the parietal cortex, which directs attention and processes spatial information. The dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmitter systems, which are essential in controlling attention and motivation, are also shown to be operating abnormally. A number of genes, including those involved in the control of dopamine and norepinephrine signaling as well as genes involved in the development of the brain regions known to be involved in attentional control, have been linked to ADHD, further indicating the disorder's significant genetic component. Overall, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) involves a number of distinct neural systems and brain areas and is characterized by symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity.
