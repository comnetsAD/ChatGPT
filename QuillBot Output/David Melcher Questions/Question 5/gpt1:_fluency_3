Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a condition that manifests as symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Inattention symptoms include trouble focusing, organizing, and finishing work, as well as forgetfulness and disarray. Fidgeting, restlessness, and trouble sitting still are all signs of hyperactivity. Acting without thinking, interrupting others, and having difficulty waiting one's turn are all symptoms of impulsivity. ADHD is considered to be caused by a mix of hereditary and environmental factors, and it has been linked to malfunction in a number of brain areas and neural networks. The prefrontal cortex is considered to be involved in attentional control and impulse regulation, the basal ganglia is thought to be involved in motor activity regulation, and the cerebellum is thought to be involved in motor coordination. Imaging studies have also shown that patients with ADHD have abnormalities in the functional connectivity and activity of the dopamine and norepinephrine systems. These systems are critical in regulating attention, motivation, and reward processing. ADHD is an attention disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. It is believed to be caused by dysfunction in several brain regions and neural networks, including the prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, as well as the dopamine and norepinephrine systems.
