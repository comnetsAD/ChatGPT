Inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity are signs of the illness known as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Inability to concentrate, organize, or finish work; forgetfulness; and disarray are all signs of inattention. Fidgeting, restlessness, and trouble sitting still are signs of hyperactivity. Acting without thinking, interfering with others, and finding it difficult to wait one's turn are all signs of impulsivity. ADHD is linked to malfunction in a number of different brain areas and neural networks and is likely to result from a mix of hereditary and environmental causes. These include the cerebellum, which is known to be involved in motor coordination, the basal ganglia, which is thought to be involved in the regulation of motor activity, and the prefrontal cortex, which is thought to play a role in attentional control and impulse regulation. Imaging research has also shown that people with ADHD have anomalies in the dopamine and norepinephrine systems' functional connection and activity. These systems are essential for controlling how attention, motivation, and reward-processing are handled. The prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, cerebellum, dopamine and norepinephrine systems, as well as other brain areas and neural networks, are hypothesized to be dysfunctional in ADHD, an attention disorder characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.
