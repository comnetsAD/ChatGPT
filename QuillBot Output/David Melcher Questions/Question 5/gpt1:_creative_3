ADHD is a condition marked by inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Inattention is characterized by difficulties with concentration, organization, and job completion, as well as forgetfulness and disorder. Symptoms of hyperactivity include restlessness and the inability to sit still. Impulsivity is characterized by acting without reflection, interrupting others, and having difficulty waiting one's turn. ADHD is believed to be caused by a mix of hereditary and environmental factors, and is correlated with malfunction in several brain areas and neural networks. The prefrontal cortex is believed to be involved in attentional control and impulse regulation, the basal ganglia in the regulation of motor activity, and the cerebellum in motor coordination. Imaging studies have shown that patients with ADHD have abnormalities in the functional connectivity and activity of the dopamine and norepinephrine systems. These systems play a vital role in regulating attention, motivation, and the processing of rewards. ADHD is a disorder of attention characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity, and is believed to be caused by dysfunction in multiple brain regions and neural networks, including the prefrontal cortex, basal ganglia, and cerebellum, in addition to the dopamine and norepinephrine systems.
