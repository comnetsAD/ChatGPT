Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a kind of attention impairment that manifests as symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. Inattention symptoms include difficulty paying attention to details, difficulties with organization, avoidance of work requiring prolonged mental effort, losing items, being easily distracted, and forgetfulness. Fidgeting, trouble staying sitting, excessive chatting, and interrupting others are all signs of hyperactivity. Acting without thinking, being impatient, and interrupting others are all symptoms of impulsivity. ADHD's specific brain processes are unknown, although evidence shows that it may entail disruption in the neural networks that govern attention and impulse control. The prefrontal cortex, which is involved in executive tasks like as attention, working memory, and impulse control, is one of these networks, as is the striatum, which is involved in reward processing and impulse control. Dysfunction in these networks may impede one's capacity to filter out distractions, retain concentration, and suppress impulses, resulting in symptoms of inattention and impulsivity. Furthermore, research have shown that people with ADHD have aberrant brain activity in regions involved with attention and impulse control, such as the frontostriatal circuit, a network that links the prefrontal cortex with the striatum. Some studies have also shown that ADHD may have a hereditary component and that it is linked to faulty dopamine modulation in the brain. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that regulates attention, motivation, and reward. As a result, improper dopamine modulation may cause problems with attention and impulse control. ADHD is an attention disease characterized by symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. It is hypothesized to be caused by failure in the brain networks that govern attention and impulse control, as well as aberrant dopamine regulation.
