Inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity are signs of the attention condition Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). Problems with organizing, avoiding jobs that demand prolonged mental work, losing things, being easily distracted, and forgetting are all indications of inattention. Fidgeting, trouble staying sat, excessive chatting, and interrupting others are all signs of hyperactivity. Acting without thinking, being impatient, and interrupting others are all signs of impulsivity. Research indicates that ADHD may be caused by malfunction in the neuronal networks that regulate attention and impulse control, while the precise brain processes underlying the disorder are still not entirely known. The prefrontal cortex, which is involved in executive abilities including attention, working memory, and impulse control, and the striatum, which is involved in reward processing and impulse control, are two examples of these networks. When these networks are dysfunctional, symptoms of inattention and impulsivity might develop because it becomes more difficult to block out distractions, stay focused, and control urges. The frontostriatal circuit, a network connecting the prefrontal cortex and the striatum, is one example of a region of the brain related with attention and impulse control that has been linked to aberrant brain activity in people with ADHD. Additionally, some research have shown that ADHD may have a hereditary component and be related to faulty dopamine control in the brain. Neurotransmitter dopamine is essential for motivation, reward, and attention. Therefore, issues with attention and impulsive control may result from aberrant dopamine modulation. In general, ADHD is an attention disorder that manifests as symptoms of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. It is also considered to be caused by aberrant dopamine regulation and malfunction in the brain networks that regulate attention and impulse control.
