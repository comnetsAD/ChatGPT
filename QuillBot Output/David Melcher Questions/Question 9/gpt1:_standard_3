A significant disorder that affects 1% of people globally is schizophrenia. Numerous symptoms, including as hallucinations, delusions, distorted thinking, and strange actions, define it. a) Symptoms: Positive symptoms and negative symptoms may be used to categorize schizophrenia symptoms. Hallucinations, delusions, and disordered thinking—including disorganized speech and mental patterns—are examples of positive symptoms. Lack of motivation, emotional numbness, and trouble interacting with others are all negative signs. b) Pharmacological therapies and neurotransmitters/hormones: Antipsychotic drugs, which target certain neurotransmitters in the brain, are the mainstay of therapy for schizophrenia. The dopamine receptor, more especially the D2 receptor, is the target of the most often prescribed antipsychotics. These medications lessen dopamine's action, which is considered to be excessive in people with schizophrenia. Serotonin receptors are also targeted by a different family of antipsychotics known as atypical antipsychotics, in addition to dopamine receptors. c) Heritability and genetics: Schizophrenia is thought to have a 70–80% heritability rate and a significant genetic component. Numerous genetic risk factors for schizophrenia have been found via studies, including polymorphisms in the dopamine and glutamate neurotransmission genes as well as genes involved in brain development and immunological response. d) Neuroimaging and changes in the brain: Research utilizing neuroimaging methods like functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) has shown that people with schizophrenia have aberrant brain activity in a number of areas, including the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, and the thalamus. Furthermore, research has shown structural variations in the brains of those with schizophrenia, including less gray matter in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, which may be related to the symptoms of the illness. Studies have also shown aberrant dopamine activity in the striatum and mesolimbic system, two regions of the brain associated with schizophrenia. This is assumed to be a critical mechanism underpinning the disease's positive symptoms. Overall, schizophrenia is a complicated condition that affects a variety of brain areas and neurotransmitters and has a wide range of symptoms. Antipsychotic drugs are often used to treat it, and there is a significant hereditary component. Numerous variations and processes in the brain that may be involved in the onset and manifestation of the illness have been identified by studies utilizing neuroimaging and other methods.
