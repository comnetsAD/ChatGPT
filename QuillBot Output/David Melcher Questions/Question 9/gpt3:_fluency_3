Schizophrenia is a serious psychopathology marked by a variety of symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, and emotional flatness. Schizophrenia symptoms often arise in late adolescence or early adulthood and might include: Positive symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, and disordered thinking, which entail anomalous experiences or beliefs that are not rooted in reality. Negative symptoms include emotional flatness, a lack of desire, and trouble feeling pleasure, all of which are caused by the absence of typical emotional or behavioral reactions. Antipsychotic drugs, which are aimed to lessen the disorder's positive symptoms, are among the pharmacological therapies for schizophrenia. These drugs function by targeting certain neurotransmitters and receptor types in the brain, such as dopamine and serotonin. Antipsychotic drugs are divided into two types: conventional antipsychotics and atypical antipsychotics. Typical antipsychotics, such as haloperidol and chlorpromazine, block the dopamine D2 receptor and are effective in reducing positive symptoms like hallucinations and delusions; however, they frequently cause severe side effects like extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) like tremors, stiffness, and restlessness. Atypical antipsychotics like clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine have a decreased risk of EPS and a better side-effect profile, but they also target other receptors including serotonin receptors and are helpful at lowering unpleasant symptoms. Schizophrenia is a complicated condition, and various variables are thought to contribute to its development. The heritability of the condition, or the extent to which it is impacted by genetics, is thought to be approximately 80%. Several genetic variants, including changes in genes involved in neurotransmission and brain development, have been linked to an increased chance of developing schizophrenia. Furthermore, patients with schizophrenia often exhibit structural and functional changes in brain areas involved in perception, attention, and emotion, such as the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala. These discrepancies imply that the neuronal networks that link these brain areas may be dysfunctional. For example, investigations utilizing imaging methods such as Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) have shown that persons with schizophrenia had lower gray matter volumes in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus. Furthermore, functional MRI investigations have shown that persons with schizophrenia have aberrant prefrontal cortex activity, which is assumed to be important in decision-making, working memory, and attention. Overall, schizophrenia is a serious psychopathology marked by a variety of symptoms such as delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, and emotional flatness. Antipsychotic medicines that target certain neurotransmitters and receptor types are used to treat it. A mix of hereditary and environmental variables are considered to impact the condition, and research has identified structural and functional changes in brain areas involved in perception, attention, and emotion in patients with schizophrenia.
