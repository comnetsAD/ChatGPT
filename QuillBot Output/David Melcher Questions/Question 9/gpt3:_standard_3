Major psychopathologies like schizophrenia are characterized by a variety of symptoms including delusions, hallucinations, abnormal thinking, and emotional numbness. Schizophrenia symptoms may include the following and usually start to show up in late adolescence or early adulthood: Hallucinations, delusions, and disordered thinking, which include the existence of anomalous experiences or beliefs that are not grounded in reality, are considered positive symptoms. Negative symptoms, which include the absence of typical emotional or behavioral reactions, include emotional flatness, a lack of desire, and trouble enjoying pleasure. Antipsychotic drugs are among the pharmacological therapies for schizophrenia that aim to lessen the disorder's positive symptoms. These drugs function by concentrating on certain brain receptor types and neurotransmitters, such dopamine and serotonin. Antipsychotic drugs may be divided into two categories: conventional antipsychotics and atypical antipsychotics. The dopamine D2 receptor is blocked by common antipsychotics like haloperidol and chlorpromazine, which effectively reduce positive symptoms like hallucinations and delusions but often cause significant side effects including extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) like tremors, stiffness, and restlessness. Atypical antipsychotics, such clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine, target other receptors like serotonin receptors and are also helpful in lowering negative symptoms. They also have a reduced risk of EPS and a better side-effect profile. Since schizophrenia is a complicated condition, several different causes are probably involved in its onset. Around 80% of a condition's heritability, or hereditary effect on the disorder, is believed to exist. The likelihood of having schizophrenia has been linked to a number of genetic variants, including changes in genes involved in neurotransmission and brain development. Additionally, studies have shown that individuals with schizophrenia often have structural and functional variations in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, which are responsible for perception, attention, and emotion. These variations imply that the neuronal networks connecting these brain areas may be dysfunctional. The prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, for instance, tend to have reduced quantities of gray matter in patients with schizophrenia, according to research utilizing imaging methods like Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Additionally, prefrontal cortex aberrant activity has been linked to schizophrenia, according to functional MRI studies. The prefrontal cortex is assumed to have a role in decision-making, working memory, and attention. Overall, delusions, hallucinations, disorganized thinking, and emotional numbness are some of the symptoms of schizophrenia, a serious psychopathology. Antipsychotic drugs that specifically target certain neurotransmitters and receptor types are the mainstay of treatment for it. Research has discovered structural and functional changes in brain areas that are involved in perception, attention, and emotion in patients with schizophrenia, which is assumed to be impacted by a mix of hereditary and environmental factors.
