Schizophrenia affects 1% of the population. Hallucinations, delusions, distorted thinking, and odd conduct are its symptoms. Schizophrenia has good and negative symptoms. Positive symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, confused speech, and thought processes. Negative symptoms include apathy, emotional flatness, and social awkwardness. b) Drugs and neurotransmitters/hormones: Antipsychotics target brain neurotransmitters to treat schizophrenia. Antipsychotics target the D2 dopamine receptor. These medications diminish schizophrenia-related dopamine overactivity. Atypical antipsychotics target dopamine and serotonin receptors. c) Heritability and genetics: Schizophrenia is 70â€“80% genetic. Schizophrenia is linked to genetic polymorphisms in dopamine, glutamate, brain development, and immune function genes. d) Neuroimaging and brain differences: Schizophrenia patients show aberrant brain activity in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and thalamus, according to fMRI studies. Schizophrenia patients have diminished gray matter in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, which may contribute to their symptoms. Schizophrenia patients have aberrant dopamine function in the striatum and mesolimbic system, which may explain their positive feelings. Schizophrenia affects numerous brain areas and neurotransmitters and has several symptoms. It is hereditary and treated with antipsychotics. Neuroimaging and other studies have shown brain variations and pathways that may cause the condition.
