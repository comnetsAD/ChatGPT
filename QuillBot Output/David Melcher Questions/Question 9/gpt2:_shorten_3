Hallucinations, delusions, abnormal thinking, and emotional flatness are signs of schizophrenia. Symptoms: Positive symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, and abnormal thinking, such as hopping from subject to issue. Negative symptoms include emotional flatness, motivation loss, and social disengagement. Schizophrenia is most often treated with antipsychotics. These drugs inhibit brain dopamine receptors, reducing the excessive dopamine activity considered to cause schizophrenia's positive symptoms. Atypical and typical antipsychotics like chlorpromazine and haloperidol are the most frequent (such as clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine) Specific neurotransmitters/hormones and receptors: Dopamine: A neurotransmitter linked to schizophrenia's positive symptoms including hallucinations and delusions. Antipsychotics inhibit brain dopamine activity to treat these symptoms. Glutamate: A neurotransmitter linked to schizophrenia's negative symptoms include emotional flatness and lack of desire. Recent study reveals that several atypical antipsychotics target the brain's glutamate system. Heritability and genetics: Schizophrenia has several causes, including genetic and environmental ones. Schizophrenia is 80% heritable according to twin studies. Dopamine and glutamate neurotransmitter genes may enhance schizophrenia risk, according to recent studies. Brain differences/mechanisms and neuroimaging: Schizophrenia patients had decreased brain volumes and less gray matter in the prefrontal cortex, temporal lobes, and hippocampus, according to structural brain imaging studies. Schizophrenia patients show aberrant brain activity in the prefrontal cortex, temporal lobes, and hippocampus, which are important in attention, memory, and emotion, according to functional neuroimaging studies. Schizophrenia may be caused by faulty brain connections. Schizophrenia is a complicated condition with hallucinations, delusions, abnormal thinking, and emotional flatness. Genetic and environmental factors may contribute to its development, and various genes have been linked to it. Schizophrenia is treated with dopamine-blocking antipsychotics. Schizophrenia may be caused by aberrant brain anatomy, activity, and connection.
