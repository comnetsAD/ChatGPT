Schizophrenia is a serious psychopathology that affects 1% of the world's population. It is distinguished by a variety of symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, disordered thinking, and strange actions. a) Symptoms: There are two types of schizophrenia symptoms: positive symptoms and negative symptoms. Hallucinations, delusions, and disordered thinking, such as disorganized speech and cognitive processes, are positive signs. Lack of drive, emotional flatness, and difficulties with social relationships are all negative indicators. b) Pharmacological therapies and neurotransmitters/hormones: Antipsychotic drugs, which target certain neurotransmitters in the brain, are used to treat schizophrenia. The dopamine receptor, especially the D2 receptor, is the target of the most often prescribed antipsychotics. These medications inhibit the action of dopamine, which is known to be excessive in people with schizophrenia. Atypical antipsychotics are antipsychotics that target serotonin receptors in addition to dopamine receptors. c) Heritability and genetics: Schizophrenia has a high hereditary component, with estimates of heritability ranging from 70 to 80%. Several genetic risk factors for schizophrenia have been found, including polymorphisms in genes involved in dopamine and glutamate neurotransmission, as well as genes involved in brain development and immunological function. d) Neuroimaging and brain differences: Neuroimaging studies, such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), have shown that people with schizophrenia have aberrant brain activity in various areas, including the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, and the thalamus. Furthermore, studies have shown structural brain changes in people with schizophrenia, such as diminished gray matter in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, which may contribute to the disorder's symptoms. Individuals with schizophrenia have aberrant dopamine function in particular parts of the brain, such as the striatum and the mesolimbic system, according to studies, which is regarded to be a major mechanism underpinning the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Overall, schizophrenia is a complicated condition that affects various brain areas and neurotransmitters. It is mostly treated with antipsychotic medications, and it has a substantial hereditary component. Neuroimaging and other approaches have shown many brain abnormalities and processes that may contribute to the disorder's development and symptoms.
