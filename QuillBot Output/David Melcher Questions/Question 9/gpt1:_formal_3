Schizophrenia is a significant psychopathology that affects 1% of the global population. It is characterized by a broad variety of symptoms, including hallucinations, delusions, disordered thought processes, and deviant actions. a) Symptoms: The symptoms of schizophrenia may be categorized as either positive or negative. Positive symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, and jumbled speech and mental processes. Negative symptoms include a lack of drive, emotional flatness, and social interaction difficulties. b) Pharmacological therapies and neurotransmitters/hormones Schizophrenia is largely treated with antipsychotic drugs that target certain neurotransmitters in the brain. The dopamine receptor, especially the D2 receptor, is the target of the most often prescribed antipsychotics. These medications lower the activity of dopamine, which is believed to be hyperactive in schizophrenia patients. In addition to targeting dopamine receptors, atypical antipsychotics further target serotonin receptors. Schizophrenia has a substantial hereditary component, with heritability estimates ranging from 70 to 80 percent. Several genetic risk factors for schizophrenia have been uncovered via research, including polymorphisms in genes implicated in dopamine and glutamate neurotransmission, as well as genes involved in brain development and immunological function. d) Neuroimaging and brain differences: Studies using neuroimaging methods like as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown that people with schizophrenia have aberrant brain activity in various locations, including the prefrontal cortex, the hippocampus, and the thalamus. In addition, studies have shown anatomical changes in the brains of persons with schizophrenia, including decreased gray matter in the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus, which may contribute to the disorder's symptoms. It is believed that aberrant dopamine activity in the striatum and mesolimbic system of persons with schizophrenia is a fundamental mechanism underpinning the positive symptoms of schizophrenia. Overall, schizophrenia is a complicated condition that affects various brain areas and neurotransmitters and is characterized by a wide variety of symptoms. It is mostly treated with antipsychotic drugs and has a significant hereditary component. Using neuroimaging and other approaches, researchers have identified many brain abnormalities and pathways that may contribute to the disorder's genesis and symptoms.
