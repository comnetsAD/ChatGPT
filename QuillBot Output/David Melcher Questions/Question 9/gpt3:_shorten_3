Symptoms of schizophrenia include delusions, hallucinations, abnormal thinking, and emotional flatness. Schizophrenia symptoms may include: Positive symptoms: hallucinations, delusions, and disordered thinking. Negative symptoms include emotional flatness, apathy, and trouble enjoying pleasure. Antipsychotic drugs reduce positive schizophrenia symptoms. These drugs target dopamine, serotonin, and brain receptors. Atypical and typical antipsychotics exist. Haloperidol and chlorpromazine, which inhibit the dopamine D2 receptor, reduce positive symptoms like hallucinations and delusions but cause significant extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) as tremors, stiffness, and restlessness. Atypical antipsychotics including clozapine, risperidone, and olanzapine target serotonin receptors and reduce unpleasant symptoms, but they have a reduced risk of EPS and fewer side effects. Schizophrenia is likely caused by several variables. The condition is considered to be 80% heritable. Neurotransmission and brain development genes are linked to schizophrenia risk. Schizophrenia patients also show structural and functional variations in the prefrontal cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala, which are involved in perception, attention, and emotion. These changes reflect aberrant neural networks connecting these brain areas. Schizophrenia patients had reduced prefrontal cortex and hippocampal gray matter, according to MRI studies. Schizophrenia patients show aberrant prefrontal brain activity, which is important in decision-making, working memory, and attention, according to functional MRI studies. Schizophrenia causes delusions, hallucinations, abnormal thinking, and emotional flatness. Antipsychotic drugs targeting certain neurotransmitters and receptors treat it. Schizophrenia is assumed to be caused by hereditary and environmental factors, and research has shown structural and functional variations in brain areas involved with perception, attention, and emotion.
