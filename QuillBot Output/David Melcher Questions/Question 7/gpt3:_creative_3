Biopsychologists use the term "consciousness" to describe a person's internal and exterior mental states and actions. It's the ability to be aware of one's physical location, emotional state, and internal processes. The term "neural correlates of consciousness" is used to describe research into the particular patterns of brain activity and neurological processes linked to perceiving the world around us. One way to do this is to investigate the neurological processes that give birth to the subjective experience of consciousness, such as by determining which areas of the brain and neural circuits are active during various states of consciousness. Several experimental approaches, including neuroimaging, neuropsychology, and electrophysiology, provide insight into the nature of consciousness. Using these techniques, scientists may investigate how and where in the brain perceptual, attentional, and memory processes take place. Use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to examine the neural correlates of visual awareness is one example of a research on the brain processes involved in consciousness. In this research, individuals may be shown pictures or patterns on an fMRI scanner while their brain activity is monitored. The exact brain areas and neural circuits related with visual awareness might then be identified by comparing the brain activity of people who are aware of the visual stimuli with those who are not. A similar method was employed by Tsuchiya and Koch (2006) to explore the neuronal bases of visual awareness. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), scientists determined that a particular brain area called the primary visual cortex (V1) was more active when participants reported being aware of the visuals they were seeing. This research shows that fMRI may be used to investigate the neural bases of consciousness and gives evidence for the importance of V1 in visual awareness.
