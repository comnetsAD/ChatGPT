The term "consciousness" comes from the field of biopsychology and refers to the state of being aware of one's surroundings as well as one's own thoughts, emotions, and perceptions. It is the individual sensation of being awake and aware at the same time. The exact patterns of brain activity that are connected with conscious experience are referred to as the neural correlates of consciousness, or NCC for short. Researchers want to get an understanding of the brain mechanisms that are responsible for conscious experience by focusing their attention on the neural correlates of consciousness. The study of consciousness and the neurological correlates of consciousness may be accomplished via a variety of experimental approaches, including the following: Functional magnetic resonance imaging, often known as fMRI, is a technology that makes use of magnetic fields in order to monitor blood flow in the brain. This blood flow serves as a proxy for neuronal activity. Researchers examine the neural activity in certain areas of the brain related with conscious experience by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Electroencephalography, more often known as EEG, is a method for measuring the electrical activity of the brain that involves the placement of electrodes on the scalp. The electroencephalogram (EEG) is a tool that may be used in the investigation of the temporal dynamics of neural activity linked with conscious experience. This may include the timing of neural activity in various areas of the brain. Transcranial magnetic stimulation, often known as TMS, is a treatment that involves the use of magnetic fields to activate certain areas of the brain. Researchers utilize transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to investigate the causal link that exists between the activity of neurons in certain parts of the brain and conscious experience. The investigation of the "default mode network" is one kind of research that might provide light on the brain processes that are associated with conscious experience (DMN). The default mode network (DMN) is a network of brain areas that are active when the brain is not concentrating on a particular activity and is considered to be "at rest." This network has been linked to self-referential thinking and introspection, both of which are seen as essential components of the conscious experience. The default mode network (DMN) is active when people are engaged in tasks that require self-referential thinking and introspection, such as remembering personal events or thinking about one's own emotions, and it is less active when people are engaged in tasks that require a significant amount of attention, according to studies that used fMRI. This lends credence to the idea that the functioning of the DMN is connected to the contents of one's conscious experience.
