The subjective experience of being aware of one's environment, thoughts, and emotions is referred to as consciousness in biopsychology. Being conscious is being aware of one's surroundings, thoughts, and emotions. Being aware of oneself and the environment around oneself is a subjective experience. Identification of particular brain activity that is connected to conscious experience is known as the study of the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC). The goal of this field's research is to identify the brain areas and functions that contribute to conscious experience. Experimental methods like as functional neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and lesion investigations are utilized to examine consciousness. The investigation into the function of the brain's default mode network (DMN) in consciousness is one example of a study on the neural correlates of consciousness. When a person is relaxing, not paying attention to the outside world, and introspecting—thinking about oneself, the past, and the future—the DMN, a network of brain areas, is active. According to research, the DMN is especially active during self-referential thinking and mind-wandering, and its activity is favorably connected with awareness. Additionally, studies have shown that the DMN is less active under anesthesia and in conditions when awareness is compromised, such as Alzheimer's disease. According to these results, the DMN is essential to the neurological underpinnings of consciousness. Another example is the investigation of the thalamus' function in consciousness. All of the sensory information that enters the brain is relayed via a brain structure called the thalamus. According to studies, the thalamus controls the degree of awareness and that its activity corresponds to various states of consciousness. For instance, the thalamus' activity is reduced during periods of profound sleep and various types of anesthesia. In conclusion, the subjective experience of being aware of one's environment, thoughts, and emotions is referred to as consciousness. Understanding which brain areas and functions are involved in producing conscious experience is the goal of research on the neural correlates of consciousness. Experimental methods like as functional neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and lesion investigations are among those employed to research consciousness. Studies have shown that the degree of awareness is strongly connected with the activity of certain brain areas, including the thalamus and the default mode network.
