Biopsychology defines consciousness as awareness of one's environment, thoughts, emotions, and perceptions. It's waking up. Neuronal correlates of consciousness (NCC) are neural patterns linked with conscious experience. Researchers examine the neurological correlates of consciousness to comprehend conscious experience. Experiments on consciousness and its brain correlates include: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI): Magnetic fields detect cerebral blood flow, which indicates neuronal activity. fMRI studies conscious experience-related brain activity. Electroencephalography (EEG): Scalp electrodes assess brain electrical activity. EEG may be used to analyze conscious experience's temporal dynamics, including brain region timing. TMS: Magnetic fields activate brain areas. TMS is used to investigate how brain activity in particular areas affects conscious experience. The "default mode network" may be involved in awareness (DMN). During "rest," the DMN is active. Self-referential thinking and introspection—signs of conscious experience—have been linked to this network. The DMN is active during self-referential thinking and introspection, such as recalling personal experiences or thinking about one's feelings, and less active during attention-demanding activities, according to fMRI studies. This shows that DMN activity is linked to consciousness.
