Consciousness is defined in biopsychology as a state of awareness of one's environment as well as one's own thoughts, emotions, and perceptions. It refers to the subjective sensation of being awake and aware. The neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) are brain activity patterns that are connected with conscious experience. Researchers want to better understand the brain mechanisms that give birth to conscious experience by investigating the neurological correlates of consciousness. Several experimental approaches are employed to investigate consciousness and its brain correlates, including: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI): This technology measures blood flow in the brain using magnetic fields as a surrogate for neuronal activity. fMRI is used by researchers to analyze neural activity in particular areas of the brain related with conscious experience. Electroencephalography (EEG): This procedure measures the electrical activity of the brain using electrodes put on the scalp. The temporal dynamics of neural activity related with conscious experience, such as the timing of neural activity in distinct areas of the brain, may be studied using EEG. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) is a procedure that employs magnetic fields to activate particular brain areas. TMS is used by researchers to investigate the link between neural activity in particular areas of the brain and conscious perception. The study of the "default mode network" is an example of a research on brain systems that may be involved in consciousness (DMN). The DMN is a network of brain areas that are active while the brain is "resting" and not engaged on a particular task. This network has been linked to self-referential thinking and introspection, both of which are thought to be characteristics of conscious experience. According to fMRI studies, the DMN is more active when individuals are engaged in activities that involve self-referential thinking and introspection, such as recalling personal experiences or thinking about one's own feelings, and less active when people are engaged in attention-demanding tasks. This shows that DMN activity is linked to conscious experience.
