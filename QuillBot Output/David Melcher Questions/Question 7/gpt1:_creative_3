Awareness of one's environment, thoughts, and feelings is what biopsychologists mean when they talk about consciousness. Awareness of one's surroundings, one's own mental and emotional states, and one's own consciousness is what we mean when we talk about consciousness. Perception is the internal state of knowing oneself and one's environment. Research into the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) aims to pinpoint the precise brain activity that is linked to perceptual awareness. Scientists in this subject are interested in determining what parts of the brain and what kinds of processing are necessary for the emergence of perceptual awareness. Several experimental methods, like as functional neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and lesion investigations, are used in the investigation of consciousness. The study of the brain's default mode network (DMN) as a potential neuronal correlate of consciousness is one such example. The default mode network (DMN) is a collection of brain areas that are engaged when a person is relaxed, not paying attention to the external environment, and engaging in introspective, self-focused contemplation of the past, present, and future. Studies have shown that self-referential thinking and mind-wandering are times when the DMN is most active, and that this activity is positively connected with overall levels of awareness. Scientists have also discovered that the DMN is less active when someone is under anesthesia or suffering from an illness like Alzheimer's disease, both of which are associated with a loss of awareness. These results point to a crucial function for the DMN in the neuronal bases of consciousness. The investigation of the thalamus' part in awareness is yet another example. Thalamus is a brain structure that acts as a hub for all incoming sensory data. The thalamus has been related to various levels of consciousness and its activity has been shown to have a role in regulating the degree of awareness. The thalamus's activity is reduced, for instance, during profound sleep and some types of anesthesia. In conclusion, awareness is the internal state of being cognizant of one's physical location, mental processes, and emotional responses. The goal of research into the neural correlates of consciousness is to identify the specific brain areas and underlying neuronal mechanisms that give rise to conscious perception. Consciousness research employs a wide range of experimental methods, including functional neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and lesion investigations. The degree of awareness has been discovered to be positively associated with the activity of the default mode network and the thalamus.
