Consciousness, as defined by biopsychology, is the subjective experience of being aware of one's environment, thoughts, and emotions. The condition of being aware of one's surroundings, thoughts, and emotions is consciousness. It is the subjective sensation of being aware of oneself and the surrounding environment. The study of neural correlates of consciousness (NCC) involves identifying particular brain activity related with conscious experience. Researchers in this subject seek to comprehend which brain regions and mechanisms contribute to conscious experience creation. Various experimental approaches, including functional neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and lesion research, are utilized to examine consciousness. The involvement of the brain's default mode network (DMN) in consciousness is an example of a study on the neural correlates of consciousness. The DMN is a network of brain areas that are active while a person is introspecting, reflecting on the past and future, and in a resting state. According to studies, the activity of the DMN is positively connected with the degree of awareness, and the DMN is most active during self-referential thought and mind wandering. Researchers have also discovered that the DMN is less active under anesthesia and in some consciousness-impairing brain illnesses, such as Alzheimer's disease. These results indicate that the DMN plays a crucial role in the neuronal processes underlying consciousness. The study of the function of the thalamus in consciousness is another example. Thalamus is a brain structure that functions as a relay station for all sensory information entering the brain. Studies indicate that the thalamus regulates the degree of awareness and that its activity is associated with various states of consciousness. During profound sleep and some types of anesthesia, for instance, the thalamus is less active. In conclusion, consciousness is the subjective awareness of one's environment, thoughts, and emotions. The goal of the research of neural correlates of consciousness is to determine which brain areas and activities contribute to conscious experience. Various experimental approaches, including as functional neuroimaging, electrophysiology, and lesion investigations, are employed to examine consciousness. According to studies, the activity of particular brain areas, including the default mode network and the thalamus, is positively connected with awareness.
