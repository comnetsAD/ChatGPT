A state of awareness of one's surroundings as well as of one's own thoughts, emotions, and sensations is referred to as consciousness in the field of biopsychology. It is the arbitrary sensation of being awake and attentive. The distinct patterns of brain activity that are connected to conscious experience are known as the neural correlates of consciousness (NCC). Researchers are attempting to comprehend the brain mechanisms that result in conscious experience by investigating the neural correlates of consciousness. To investigate consciousness and its brain correlates, a variety of experimental techniques are used, including: Using magnetic fields, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures blood flow in the brain as a stand-in for neuronal activity. Using fMRI, scientists may examine the neural activity in particular brain areas linked to conscious experience. Using electrodes positioned on the scalp, electroencephalography (EEG) measures the electrical activity of the brain. The timing of neural activity in various brain areas is one example of how EEG may be used to explore the temporal dynamics of neural activity linked to conscious experience. Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS): This method stimulates certain parts of the brain using magnetic fields. The causal link between neural activity in certain brain areas and conscious experience is being investigated by researchers using TMS. The research on the "default mode network" is one example of a study on the brain processes that may be related to consciousness (DMN). When the brain is "at rest" and not engaged on a particular task, a network of brain areas known as the DMN is active. Self-referential thinking and introspection, which are regarded as defining characteristics of conscious experience, have been linked to this network. The DMN is active when individuals are doing activities that call for self-referential thinking and introspection, such as recalling past experiences or considering one's own feelings, and it is less active when people are performing attention-demanding tasks, according to studies utilizing fMRI. This shows a connection between DMN activity and conscious experience.
