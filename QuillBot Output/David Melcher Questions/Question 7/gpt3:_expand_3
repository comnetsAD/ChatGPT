The term "consciousness" originates from the field of biopsychology and refers to a person's internal and exterior experiences, including their perceptions, thoughts, feelings, and intentions. It is the knowledge of one's environment, oneself, and one's own mental states all at the same time. The study of the "neural correlates" of consciousness is synonymous with the investigation of the distinct patterns of brain activity and neural processes that are connected to conscious experience. This may entail determining the exact brain areas and neural circuits that are active during the various states of consciousness, as well as investigating how these neurological processes give birth to the individual's sense of having a conscious state of mind. Experimentally investigating consciousness may be done using a variety of approaches, including neuroimaging, neuropsychology, and electrophysiology, amongst others. Researchers are able to investigate the neuronal activity and areas of the brain that are connected with various conscious states, such as perception, attention, and memory, thanks to the methodologies that have been developed. The use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to research the neural correlates of visual awareness is an example of a study that focuses on the brain processes that are involved in the process of consciousness. The participants in this research may be shown visual stimuli, such as pictures or patterns, while their brain activity is measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The brain activity of participants who are aware of the visual stimuli could then be compared with the brain activity of participants who are not aware of the visual stimuli in order for researchers to identify the specific regions of the brain and neural circuits that are associated with visual consciousness. Tsuchiya and Koch conducted research on the brain correlates of visual awareness in 2006 and published their findings using a methodology that was quite similar to ours. They found that a particular region of the brain known as the primary visual cortex (V1) was more active when participants reported being aware of the images they were viewing, and they were able to determine this by using an fMRI to measure the activity level of the brains of participants as they viewed a rapid stream of images. This work not only illustrates that fMRI may be used to explore the neural correlates of consciousness, but it also offers evidence for the function that the V1 region plays in the process of visual awareness.
