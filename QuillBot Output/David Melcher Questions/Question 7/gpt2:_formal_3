A state of awareness of one's surroundings and one's own thoughts, emotions, and perceptions. The subjective sensation of being awake and aware. Brain correlates of consciousness (NCC) are the unique neural activity patterns linked with conscious experience. Researchers seek to comprehend the brain mechanisms that give birth to conscious experience by examining the neural correlates of consciousness. Several experimental approaches are used to investigate consciousness and its brain correlates, including: Using magnetic fields, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) measures blood flow in the brain, a surrogate for neuronal activity. fMRI is used by researchers to examine neural activity in particular areas of the brain related with conscious experience. Electroencephalography (EEG): This procedure measures the electrical activity of the brain using electrodes put on the scalp. EEG may be used to examine the temporal dynamics of neural activity related with conscious experience, including the timing of neural activity in various brain areas. Using magnetic fields, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) stimulates particular areas of the brain. TMS is used to investigate the causal link between neural activity in certain brain areas and conscious perception. The study of the "default mode network" is an example of research into the brain systems that may be involved in consciousness (DMN). The DMN is a network of brain areas that are active during "rest" and when the brain is not engaged on a particular task. This network has been linked to self-referential thought and introspection, which are regarded as defining characteristics of conscious experience. fMRI studies have revealed that the DMN is active when people are engaged in tasks that require self-referential thinking and introspection, such as remembering personal events or thinking about one's own emotions, and that it is less active when people are engaged in tasks that require focused attention. This indicates that DMN activation is associated with conscious experience.
