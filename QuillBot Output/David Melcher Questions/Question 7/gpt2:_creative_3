Consciousness, in biopsychology, is defined as the capacity to be aware of one's physical location and internal states of mind. Being awake and aware is a state of mind. What we call "neural correlates of consciousness" (NCC) refers to the observable patterns of brain activity that are known to underlie subjective states of awareness. Researchers want to comprehend the brain mechanisms that give birth to conscious experience by researching the neural correlates of consciousness. Several experimental approaches are used to investigate the links between consciousness and the brain, such as: Blood flow is a surrogate for cerebral activity and may be measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Brain areas involved in conscious experience are the focus of fMRI research. In electroencephalography (EEG), electrodes are positioned on the scalp to record the brain's electrical activity. Temporal dynamics of neural activity related with conscious experience may be studied by EEG by looking at when activity occurs in various brain areas. Using magnetic fields, a procedure called transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) may activate certain areas of the brain. TMS allows researchers to investigate the link between brain activity in particular areas and subjective perception. One area of research that may provide light on the brain's role in consciousness is the study of the so-called "default mode network" (DMN). The Default Mode Network (DMN) is a collection of brain areas that are operational when an individual is not engaged in any particular mental activity. Self-referential thought and introspection, considered to be defining features of conscious experience, have been linked to this network. Imaging studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) have shown that the DMN is more active during introspective and self-referential activities, such as recalling personal memories or reflecting on one's own feelings, and less active during attention-demanding activities. This points to a connection between DMN activation and perceptual awareness.
