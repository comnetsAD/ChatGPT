Mood disorders and anxiety disorders together make up the largest subsets of the mental diseases that people suffer from. Mood disorders including severe depression and mania are quite common in the psychiatric population. An estimated 350 million individuals worldwide suffer from major depressive disorder, making it the biggest cause of disability globally, as reported by the World Health Organization (WHO). An estimated 60 million individuals throughout the globe suffer from bipolar illness. Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also common. Around 264 million individuals worldwide suffer from anxiety disorders, as reported by the World Health Organization. Age, gender, and geography are only a few of the variables that might affect the prevalence of mental diseases. For instance, women much outnumber men when it comes to the prevalence of mental health issues such as mood and anxiety disorders. The incidence of specific mental problems may be greater in particular geographies or cultural groupings, according to some research. The widespread occurrence of mental health issues points to the existence of deep-rooted biological causes. Since mood and anxiety disorders are so common, it's reasonable to assume that both hereditary and environmental variables play a role in their onset and maintenance. Furthermore, the fact that prevalence might vary with age, gender, and region shows that interactions between hereditary and environmental variables may contribute to the development of various illnesses. In conclusion, mood disorders and anxiety disorders account for the vast majority of all psychiatric diagnoses. Variation in the prevalence of psychiatric diseases across demographic categories such as age, gender, and geographic location is consistent with a biological basis for these disorders that is both hereditary and environmental in nature.
