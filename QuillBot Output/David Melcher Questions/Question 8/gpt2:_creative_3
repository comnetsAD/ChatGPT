Mood disorders like major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, and anxiety disorders like generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder, are the most common forms of mental illness. For instance, the frequency of anxiety disorders rises with age and is more frequent in women than in males. However, mood disorders are more frequent in males than in women, and their frequency is highest in young adults before declining with age. Some mental diseases seem to be more common in some parts of the globe, suggesting that geography may have a role in the overall incidence of these conditions. Cultural, socioeconomic, and environmental variables all contribute to differences in the prevalence of psychiatric diseases. Prevalence rates of mental diseases may be affected by cultural variables that shape how people experience and report their symptoms. Poverty, a lack of resources (such as healthcare and education), and traumatic experiences are all examples of social and environmental variables that may contribute to the development of mental health problems. The incidence of these illnesses does not provide much insight into their underlying biology. However, there is evidence that the causes of psychiatric diseases are multifaceted, including several genes, the environment, and neurobiology. Evidence suggests that variations in the functioning of specific neurotransmitters (such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine) and structural changes in particular brain areas (such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex) contribute to the development of anxiety and mood disorders. In conclusion, anxiety disorders and mood disorders are the most common types of psychiatric illness, the prevalence of psychiatric disorders varies with factors like age, gender, and location, and the biological underpinnings of psychiatric disorders are complex and involve a combination of genetic, environmental, and neurobiological factors.
