The most common mental illnesses are those classified as mood disorders and anxiety disorders. The most common mental illnesses are mood disorders, such as major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that major depressive disorder is the biggest cause of disability in the world, impacting an estimated 350 million individuals. Around 60 million individuals worldwide suffer from bipolar illness. Generalized anxiety disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are also common. Anxiety disorders impact around 264 million people globally, according to the WHO. The prevalence of mental diseases varies according to age, gender, and geographic region. Females, for example, are more likely than men to suffer from mood and anxiety problems. Furthermore, some research has revealed that the frequency of certain mental problems may be greater in specific geographical areas or ethnic groupings. The frequency of mental diseases shows that they have complicated biological roots. The high frequency of mood and anxiety disorders shows that there may be a hereditary component to these diseases, as well as environmental variables that contribute to their development. Furthermore, the fact that prevalence varies with age, gender, and geographic location shows that genetic and environmental variables may interact to contribute to the development of various illnesses.
