Anxiety disorders, such as generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder, and mood disorders, such as major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, are the most common mental disorders. The prevalence of mental diseases varies by age, gender, and geographic region. Anxiety disorders, for example, are more frequent in women than in males, and their incidence rises with age. Mood disorders, on the other hand, are more frequent in males than in women, with frequency peaking in early adulthood and then declining with age. Geographic location may also influence the frequency of mental diseases, with different parts of the globe having greater rates of specific disorders. Psychiatric illness frequency varies according to cultural, socioeconomic, and environmental variables. Cultural influences may impact how symptoms of mental diseases are viewed and reported, affecting the prevalence rates of these disorders. Poverty, a lack of access to treatment and education, and exposure to traumatic experiences may all raise the likelihood of developing psychiatric problems. The frequency of these illnesses makes inferences regarding their molecular origins problematic. According to studies, psychiatric diseases have complicated etiologies that include a mix of genetic, environmental, and neurological variables. There is evidence of alterations in the functioning of certain neurotransmitters (such as serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine) and structural changes in certain brain regions (such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex) in anxiety and mood disorders, which may contribute to the development of these disorders. In summary, the most common psychiatric disorders are anxiety and mood disorders, the prevalence of psychiatric disorders varies with age, gender, and geographic location, and the biological underpinnings of these disorders are complex and involve a combination of genetic, environmental, and neurobiological factors.
