Mood disorders and anxiety disorders are the two types of mental illnesses that are most common. Among the most common mental conditions are mood disorders such major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that major depressive illness, which affects 350 million people globally, is the primary cause of disability. There are around 60 million persons with bipolar disorder globally. Additionally common are anxiety disorders such post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). Around 264 million people worldwide are said to be affected by anxiety disorders, according to the WHO. Age, gender, and geography are only a few examples of the variables that might affect the prevalence of mental diseases. For instance, girls are more likely than men to have mood and anxiety problems. Furthermore, some research have hypothesized that specific geographical areas or ethnic groupings may have greater incidence rates of certain mental diseases. The frequency of mental diseases raises the possibility that they have intricate biological foundations. The high frequency of mood and anxiety disorders raises the possibility that hereditary and environmental variables may both play a role in the development of these conditions. Additionally, the fact that prevalence might change depending on variables like age, gender, and region raises the possibility that hereditary and environmental factors interact to contribute to the emergence of these illnesses. In conclusion, mood disorders and anxiety disorders are the two types of mental diseases that are most common. Age, gender, and geographic location all have an impact on the prevalence of psychiatric illnesses, suggesting that these conditions may have complex biological foundations including both inherited and environmental variables.
