Variations in the prevalence of mental diseases may be caused by variables such as age, gender, and geographic region. Mood disorders and anxiety disorders, for instance, are more prevalent in girls than in men. In addition, a number of studies have revealed that the frequency of certain mental diseases may be greater in certain geographic locations or cultural groupings. The frequency of mental diseases shows that many conditions have intricate biological bases. The high incidence of mood and anxiety disorders shows that both hereditary and environmental variables may play a role in their development.

In conclusion, the most frequent mental illnesses belong to the categories of mood disorders and anxiety disorders. Variables such as age, gender, and geographical location may influence the prevalence of psychiatric diseases, indicating that many conditions have complex hereditary and environmental causes.
