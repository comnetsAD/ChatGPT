Anxiety, mood, and drug use disorders are the most common forms of mental illness. Disorders of anxiety, such as generalized anxiety and panic, top the list of most prevalent mental illnesses. Roughly 20% of the world's population has some kind of it. Around 10% of the world's population suffers from a mood condition such serious depression or bipolar disorder. Roughly 5% of people throughout the world suffer from a substance use problem. Psychiatric disorder prevalence may differ between age groups, sexes, and locations. Women experience depression at a greater rate than males do, and industrialized nations have a higher rate of anxiety disorders than less developed nations. Given how common psychiatric diseases are, we might assume that a number of elements, including those of a biological, social, and psychological nature, interact to bring about their onset and maintenance. Multiple genetic and environmental variables, including stress, trauma, and life events, undoubtedly have a role in the development of these illnesses. In addition, the incidence and appearance of various illnesses may be influenced by differences in their underlying brain processes. Anxiety disorders, mood disorders, and drug use disorders are the three most frequent types of mental illness. There are a number of characteristics, including age, gender, and geography, that might affect the rate at which mental diseases are diagnosed and treated. The high incidence rates of these conditions point to distinct brain pathways that are impacted by several variables including genetics, environment, and psychology.
