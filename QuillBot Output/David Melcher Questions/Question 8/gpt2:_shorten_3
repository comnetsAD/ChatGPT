Anxiety disorders like generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder and mood disorders like major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder are the most common. Age, gender, and geography affect mental problem prevalence. Anxiety disorders are more frequent in women and rise with age. However, mood problems are more frequent in males than women and peak in early adulthood before declining with age. Psychiatric problems are also more common in some locations of the globe. Cultural, socioeconomic, and environmental variables affect psychiatric problem prevalence. Cultural influences may alter how mental illness symptoms are perceived and recorded, affecting prevalence rates. Poverty, lack of treatment and education, and trauma may raise the risk of psychiatric diseases. Prevalence does not indicate biological causes. However, evidence reveals that psychiatric diseases have multiple hereditary, environmental, and neurological causes. In anxiety and mood disorders, neurotransmitters like serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine and brain areas including the amygdala, hippocampus, and prefrontal cortex may be altered. In summary, anxiety and mood disorders are the most common psychiatric illnesses, their incidence varies with age, gender, and region, and their biological foundations are complicated and include genetic, environmental, and neurological variables.
