The most common types of mental illnesses are those that are classified as either anxiety disorders or mood disorders. Mood disorders, including major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder, are among the most common types of psychiatric conditions. [Case in point:] Major depressive disorder is the biggest cause of disability in the globe, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and it affects an estimated 350 million people. The condition known as bipolar disorder affects around 60 million individuals all over the globe. In addition, anxiety disorders such as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and generalized anxiety disorder are quite common. The World Health Organization estimates that over 264 million individuals throughout the globe suffer from anxiety disorders. There are a number of variables that might influence the prevalence of mental diseases, including age, gender, and geographical region. For instance, mood disorders and anxiety disorders are far more prevalent in girls than they are in men. In addition, a number of studies have presented evidence that the incidence of certain mental diseases may be more prevalent in particular geographical areas or among particular cultural groups. The high frequency of mood and anxiety disorders shows that these conditions may have a genetic component, in addition to environmental variables that contribute to the development of these conditions. These conditions are thought to be caused by a combination of these two elements. In addition, the fact that the prevalence might change depending on characteristics such as age, gender, and geographical location is suggestive of the possibility that there may be interactions between hereditary elements and environmental factors that contribute to the development of various illnesses. In conclusion, the most common types of mental diseases are those that are classified as either anxiety disorders or mood disorders. It has been shown that the prevalence of psychiatric diseases may change depending on characteristics such as age, gender, and geographical location. This shows that the biological foundations of these disorders are complicated and include both inherited and environmental factors.
