To establish whether or not Conch Republic should develop the new smartphone, a financial study should be carried out to analyze the potential profitability of the project. This will help determine whether or not the company should produce the new smartphone. This study would entail determining the project's net present value (NPV), which compares the present value of the cash flows generated by the project to the initial investment in the project. NPV stands for "net present value." Payback term, internal rate of return (IRR), and profitability index are some more aspects that should be taken into consideration. In this particular scenario, Conch Republic will be required to make an investment of $41.5 million for the necessary equipment, in addition to having to spend $5.4 million annually on fixed expenditures. It is anticipated that the new smartphone will sell 67,000 units in the first year, 108,000 units in the second year, 93,000 units in the third year, 86,000 units in the fourth year, and 55,000 units in the fifth year. Calculating the NPV of the project and comparing it to the desired return of 12 percent is possible now that these inputs have been provided. If the net present value (NPV) comes out positive, this would suggest that the project is profitable and ought to be carried out.
