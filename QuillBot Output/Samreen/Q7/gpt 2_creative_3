Conch Republic should evaluate the NPV of the project to decide whether or not to create the new smartphone. The net present value (NPV) is a measure of the project's profitability that accounts for inflation. If the NPV of a project is positive, it means that the cash flow generated by the project will be greater than the initial investment. The following data is necessary for calculating the NPV: The preliminary expenditures were $41.5 million for machinery, $1.5 million for prototype creation, and $250,000 for a market analysis. For the next five years, we project annual sales of $67,000, $108,000, $93,000, $86,000, and $55,000. $525 per unit. Prices per unit that are subject to change amount to $210 in total. Expenses that remain constant each year amount to $5.4 million. Initial equipment cost of $41.5 million divided by 7 years equals depreciation (MACRS schedule) Value of equipment at project completion: $5.9 million Money in the bank: 20% of revenue The current tax rate is 22%. Annualized Return Target: 12% The NPV of the new smartphone project can be computed with these numbers: Initial Investment, Year 0 Machinery: -41.5 million dollars Initial investment in prototype: -$1.5 million Research in Marketing: -250,000 $43.25 million in losses Year 1: Sixty-seven thousand times five hundred twenty-five dollars is thirty-five million and two hundred seventy-five thousand dollars Total Variable Expenses: $14,070,000 (67,000 x $210/month) The profit from contributions is $21,205,000 ($35,275,000 minus $14,070,000). Fees and rent: $5,400,000 Reduce $41,500,000 by 7 and get $5,928,571 in depreciation. Pretax income of $9,876,429 is $21,205,000 minus $5,400,000 and $5,928,571. Payment of $2,167,722 is due as taxes ($9,876,429 multiplied by 22%). Taxes deducted from gross income: $9,876,429 less $2,167,722 Calculating Working Capital: $67k * $525 * 20% = $2.78M Income: $5,970,707 - $2,738,000 = $7,708,707 NPV: ($5,970,707 / (1 + 0.12)^1) - $43,250,000 = -$38,931,634 Year 2: 108,000 x $525 Equals $57,300,000 in sales. 108,000 x $210 = $22,680,000 in yearly variable expenditures. $57,300,000 - $22,680,000 = $34,620,000 Profit from contributions Expenses that won't change: $5,400,000 Waste: $5,928,571 Total pretax income = $23,291,429 (34,000,600,000 - 5,400,000 - 5,928,571). Taxes equal $5,121,817 ($23,291,429 multiplied by 22%). Income: $23,291,429 - $5,121,817 = $18,169,612 Tentatively, let's say that you need $4,552 in working capital; hence, multiply 108,000 by $525 by 20%.
