To establish if Conch Republic should create the new smartphone, it is necessary to undertake a financial analysis to determine the project's potential profitability. This analysis would estimate the project's net present value (NPV), which compares the present value of the cash flows generated by the project to the initial investment. Additionally, the payback duration, internal rate of return (IRR), and profitability index should be considered. In this scenario, Conch Republic will be required to invest $41.5 million in equipment and incur annual fixed costs of $5.4 million. The expected annual sales estimates for the new smartphone are 67,000, 108,000, 93,000, 86,000, and 55,000 for the following five years. With these inputs, it is possible to compute the project's NPV and compare it to the needed return of 12%. If the NPV is positive, the project is likely profitable and should be pursued.
