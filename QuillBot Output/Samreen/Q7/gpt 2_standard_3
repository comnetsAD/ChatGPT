Conch Republic should analyze the project's net present value (NPV) in order to decide whether or not to create the new smartphone. The net present value (NPV), which accounts for time value of money, is a gauge of a project's profitability. A project will create more cash flow than the initial investment if the NPV is positive; otherwise, it is negative. In order to compute the NPV, the following details are required: Initial outlay: $41.5 million for equipment, $1.5 million for developing a prototype, and $250 000 for a marketing analysis The following five years will see annual sales of 67,000, 108,000, 93,000, 86,000, and 55,000. Cost per unit: $525 Variable costs per unit: $210 annual fixed costs of $5.4 million Depreciation: $41.5 million (cost of new equipment) divided by seven years (MACRS schedule) At project's conclusion, equipment was worth $5.9 million. 20% of sales go toward working capital. 22% tax rate Return necessary: 12% These numbers can be used to determine the new smartphone project's net present value (NPV): Initial Investment Year 0: Hardware: $41.5 million less Development of prototypes: $1.5 million Market research: $250,000. Total: -43.25 million dollars Year 1: Sales: 67,00 times $525 equals 35,275,000 Variable expenses: 67,000 times $210 equals $14,070,000 Margin of contribution: $21,205,000 ($35,275,000 - $14,070,000). Costs fixed: $5,400,000 Depreciation: $5,928,571 ($41,500,000 / 7) Earnings before taxes: $21, 205,000 - $5, 400,000 - $5,928, 571 = $9,876, 429 Taxes: $2,167,722 ($9,876,429 x 22%) $9,876,429 in income less $2,167,722 in taxes is $7,708,707. Working capital: 67,000 times $525 times 20% is $2,738,000. Flow of cash: $7,708,707 less $2,738,000 equals $5,970,707. NPV: ($5,970,707 / (1 + 0.12)^1) - $43,250,000 = -$38,931,634 Year 2: Sales: 108,000 times $525 is $57,300,000. Variable expenses: 108,000 times $210 is 22,680,000 Contribution margin: $34,620,000 ($57,300,000 - $22,680,000). Costs fixed: $5,400,000 $5,928,571 in depreciation Income before taxes: $23,291,429 ($34,620,000 - $5,400,000 - $5,928,571) Taxes: $5,121,817 ($23,291,429 x 22%) After taxes, your income is: $23,291,429 - $5,121,817 = $18,169,612 Working capital: $108,000 Ã— $525 x 20% = $4,452
