To determine whether Conch Republic should produce the new smartphone, a financial analysis should be performed to assess the project's potential profitability. This analysis would include calculating the project's net present value (NPV), which compares the present value of the project's cash flows to the initial investment. The payback period, internal rate of return (IRR), and profitability index are also important considerations. In this case, Conch Republic will need to invest $41.5 million in equipment and spend $5.4 million per year on fixed costs. For each of the next five years, sales of the new smartphone are expected to be 67,000, 108,000, 93,000, 86,000, and 55,000 units. The NPV of the project can be calculated using these inputs and compared to the required return of 12 percent. If the NPV is positive, the project is likely to be profitable and should be pursued.
