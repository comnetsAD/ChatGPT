An NPV analysis should be done to decide if Conch Republic should make the new smartphone. NPV accounts for time value of money and measures project profitability. Positive NPVs mean the project will generate more cash flow than the initial investment, while negative NPVs mean the opposite. Information needed to calculate NPV: Initial investment: $41.5 million equipment, $1.5 million prototype development, $250,000 marketing study. 67,000, 108,000, 93,000, 86,000, and 55,000 annual sales for the next five years. $525/unit Variable costs: $210 each. Annual fixed costs: $5.4 million Depreciation: $41.5 million (initial equipment cost)/7 years (MACRS schedule) End-project equipment value: $5.9 million Working capital: 20% sales 22%. Return: 12% These statistics compute the new smartphone project's NPV: Initial Investment: Equipment: -$41.5 million Prototype development: -$1.5 million Marketing study: -$250,000 $-$43.25 million Year 1: Sales: $35,275,000 (67,000 x $525). Variable costs: 67,000 x $210= $14,070,000 Contribution margin: $35,275,000â€“$14,070,000 = $21,205,000 $5,000,000. Depreciation: $41,500,000/7 = $5,928,571 Before taxes: $21,205,000 - $5,400,000 - $5,928,571 = $9,876,429 Taxes: $9,876,429 x 22%= $2,167,722. Taxes: $9,876,429 - $2,167,722 = $7,708,707 Working capital: 67,000 x $525 x 20%= $2,738,000 Cash: $7,708,707 - $2,738,000 = $5,970,707 NPV: ($5,970,707 / (1 + 0.12)^1) - $43,250,000 = -$38,931,634 Year 2: Sales: $57,300,000 (108,000 x $525). Variable costs: 108,000 x $210= $22,680,000 Contribution margin: $34,620,000 (57,300,000 - $22,680,000). $5,000,000. $5,928,571 Before taxes: $34,620,000 - $5,400,000 - $5,928,571 = $23,291,429 Taxes: $23,291,429 x 22%= $5,121,817 After taxes: $23,291,429 - $5,121,817 = $18,169,612 Working capital: 108,000 x $525 x 20%= $4,452.
