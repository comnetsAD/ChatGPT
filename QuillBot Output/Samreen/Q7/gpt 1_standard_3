Conch Republic should undertake a financial analysis to assess the project's potential profitability before deciding whether to create the new smartphone. Estimating the project's net present value (NPV), which contrasts the present value of the cash flows generated by the project to the initial investment, is a part of this research. The payback period, internal rate of return (IRR), and profitability index are other elements to take into account. Conch Republic will have to pay $41.5 million for the required equipment in this case, as well as $5.4 million in annual fixed expenditures. For each of the following five years, sales of the new smartphone are anticipated to be 67,000, 108,000, 93,000, 86,000, and 55,000, respectively. With these inputs, the project's net present value (NPV) may be determined and contrasted with the needed return of 12%. Positive NPV results would suggest that the project is profitable and ought to be undertaken.
