A financial analysis should determine whether Conch Republic should make the new smartphone. This research estimates the project's net present value (NPV), which compares the project's cash flows to the initial investment. Payback period, IRR, and profitability index are also important. Conch Republic will need $41.5 million for equipment and $5.4 million in fixed costs every year. For the next five years, the new smartphone is expected to sell 67,000, 108,000, 93,000, 86,000, and 55,000 units. These inputs calculate the project's NPV and compare it to the required return of 12%. If NPV is positive, the project is profitable and should be pursued.
