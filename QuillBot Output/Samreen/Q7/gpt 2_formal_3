To evaluate if Conch Republic should develop the new smartphone, the net present value (NPV) of the project should be analyzed. NPV is a measure of the profitability of a project that accounts for the time value of money. A positive NPV implies that the cash flow generated by the project will exceed the initial investment, whereas a negative NPV indicates the opposite. For calculating NPV, the following data is required: Initial expenditures: $41.5 million for equipment, $1.5 million for prototype development, and $250,000 for marketing research. Sixty-seven thousand, 108 thousand, 93 thousand, 86 thousand, and 55,000 for each of the next five years. Unit price: $525 Variable costs: $210 per unit Annual fixed costs of $5,4 million Depreciation: $41.5 million / 7 years (original equipment cost) (MACRS schedule) Equipment value at end of project: $5.9 million 20% of revenue as working capital Tax levy: 22% Required yield: 13% The NPV of the new smartphone project can be computed using these numbers: Year 0 (Investment Initiation): Equipment: -$41.5 million Prototype development: -$1.5 million Market research: -$250,000 Total: -$43.25 million Year 1: Sales: 67,000 x $525 = $35,275,000 Variable costs: 67,000 x $210 = $14,070,000 Margin of contribution: $35,275,000 - $14,070,000 = $21,205,000 Fixed costs: $5,400,000 Depreciation: $41,500,000 divided by seven is $5,928,571 $21,205,000 - $5,000,000 - $5,928,571 = $9,876,429 in income before taxes. Taxes: $9,876,429 x 22% = $2,167,722 $9,876,429 - $2,167,722 = $7,708,707 after taxes Working capital: 67,000 times $525 times 20% $7,708,707 - $2,738,000 = $5,977,707 in cash flow. NPV: ($5,970,707 / (1 + 0.12)^1) - $43,250,000 = -$38,931,634 Year 2: Sales: 108,000 x $525 = $57,300,000 Variable costs: 108,000 x $210 = $22,680,000 Margin of contribution: $57,300,000 minus $22,680,000 = $34,620,000 Fixed expenses amount to $5,400,000 Depreciation totaling $5,928,571 $34,620,000 - $5,400,000 - $5,928,571 = $23,291,429 in income before taxes. Taxes: $23,291,429 x 22% = $5,121,817 $23,291,429 - $5,121,817 = $18,169,612 Net Income Working capital = $4,452 x 108,000 x $525 x 20%
