An analysis of the project's net present value (NPV) should be performed to determine whether Conch Republic should produce the new smartphone. The NPV is a measure of project profitability that considers the time value of money. A positive net present value indicates that the project will generate more cash flow than the initial investment, whereas a negative net present value indicates the opposite. The following information is required to calculate the NPV: The initial investment is $41.5 million for equipment, $1.5 million for prototype development, and $250,000 for marketing research. For the next five years, annual sales will be 67,000, 108,000, 93,000, 86,000, and 55,000. $525 per unit Variable costs per unit: $210. Annual fixed costs: $5.4 million Depreciation: $41.5 million (cost of initial equipment) x 7 years (MACRS schedule) Equipment cost $5.9 million at the end of the project. Working capital is equal to 20% of sales. 22% tax rate 12% is the required return. The NPV for the new smartphone project can be calculated using these figures: Year 1 (First Investment): 41.5 million dollars in equipment -$1.5 million for prototype development Marketing research: -$250,000 -$43.25 million in total Year 1: 67,000 x $525 = $35,275,000 in sales 67,000 x $210 = $14,070,000 in variable costs Margin of contribution: $35,275,000 - $14,070,000 = $21,205,000 Fixed expenses: $5,400,000 Depreciation: $41,500,000 divided by 7 equals $5,928,571. Before-tax income: $21,205,000 - $5,400,000 - $5,928,571 = $9,876,429 $9,876,429 x 22% = $2,167,722 in taxes After-tax income: $9,876,429 - $2,167,722 = $7,708,707 67,000 x $525 x 20% = $2,738,000 in working capital $7,708,707 - $2,738,000 = $5,970,707 in cash flow NPV: ($5,970,707 / (1 + 0.12)^1) - $43,250,000 = -$38,931,634 Year 2: 108,000 x $525 = $57,300,000 in sales Variable costs are as follows: 108,000 x $210 = $22,680,000 Margin of contribution: $57,300,000 - $22,680,000 = $34,620,000 Fixed expenses: $5,400,000 Depreciation is $5,928,571.00. Before-tax income: $34,620,000 - $5,400,000 - $5,928,571 = $23,291,429 $23,291,429 x 22% = $5,121,817 in taxes After-tax income: $23,291,429 - $5,121,817 = $18,169,612 Working capital is calculated as 108,000 x $525 x 20% = $4,452.
