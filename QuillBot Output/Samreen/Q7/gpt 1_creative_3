Conch Republic needs to do a cost-benefit analysis to decide if it should make the new smartphone. Calculating the NPV of a project entails comparing the value of future cash flows from the project to the initial investment. Payback time, IRR, and profitability index are a few other metrics to think about. Conch Republic will have to spend $5.4 million annually on fixed costs in addition to the $41.5 million needed to purchase the essential equipment. The new smartphone is expected to sell 67,000 units in the first year, 108,000 units in the second year, 93,000 units in the third year, 86,000 units in the fourth year, and 55,000 units in the fifth year. It is possible to compute the project's NPV with these parameters in hand and compare it to the minimum acceptable rate of return of 12%. The project's profitability can be gauged by calculating its net present value (NPV), and if it's positive, the plan should be implemented.
