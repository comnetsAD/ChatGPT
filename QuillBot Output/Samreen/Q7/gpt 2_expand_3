An evaluation of the project's net present value (NPV) needs to be carried out in order to establish whether or not Conch Republic ought to go forward and manufacture the new smartphone. The net present value (NPV) is a measure of the profitability of the project that takes into account the worth of money over time. When the NPV is positive, it implies that the project will generate more cash flow than the initial investment, and when the NPV is negative, it suggests that the opposite will occur. The following pieces of information are required in order to calculate the NPV: Initial investment of $41.5 million for equipment, plus $1.5 million for prototype development, plus $250,000 for marketing research. For the next five years, annual sales are projected to be as follows: 67,000, 108,000, 93,000, and 86,000, respectively. Unit price: $525 Variable costs: $210 per unit The annual amount of $5.4 million for fixed expenses Initial equipment cost of $41.5 million divided by seven years equals depreciation (MACRS schedule) Equipment value at end of project: $5.9 million To calculate working capital, deduct 20% of sales. Taxes at a rate of 22% The required rate of return is 12%. Calculating the new smartphone project's net present value (NPV) can be done with the following data: Initial Investment, or Year 0: Equipment: -$41.5 million Prototype development: -$1.5 million Research on marketing: a loss of $250,000 Total: -$43.25 million Year 1: Sales: 67,000 x $525 = $35,275,000 Variable costs: 67,000 x $210 = $14,070,000 Contribution margin equals $21,205,000 after subtracting $14,070,000 from $35,275,000. Total commitments: $5,400,000 Depreciation equals $5,928,571 when $41,500,000 is divided by seven. $21,205,000 minus $5,000,000 minus $5,928,571 equals $9,876,429 in income before taxes. Taxes: $9,876,429 x 22% = $2,167,722 $9,876,429 minus $2,167,722 in taxation yields $7,708,707 in after-tax income. Calculating working capital: 67,000 times $525 times 20% yields a total of $2,738,000 The cash flow is: $5,970,707 minus $2,738,000, which is $7,708,707 NPV: ($5,970,707 / (1 + 0.12)^1) - $43,250,000 = -$38,931,634 Year 2: Sales: 108,000 x $525 = $57,300,000 Variable costs: 108,000 x $210 = $22,680,000 Contribution margin equals $34,620,000 after subtracting $57,300,000 from $22,680,000. Fixed costs: $5,400,000 The cost of depreciation was $5,928,571 $34,620,000 minus $5,000,000 minus $5,928,571 equals $23,291,429 in income before taxes. Taxes: $23,291,429 x 22% = $5,121,817 $18,169,612 is the amount of money received after deducting taxes from a total income of $23,291,429 Calculating the working capital required: 108,000 times $525 times 20% = $4,452
