Based on the information provided, the company should issue debt to finance the land purchase in order to maximize its total market value. Kim Weyand, the company's new CFO, calculated that the current cost of capital is 12.5 percent and believes that the company would be more valuable if debt were included in its capital structure. Furthermore, it has been stated that the company can issue bonds at par with an 8 percent coupon rate, and that a capital structure of 70 percent equity/30 percent debt would be optimal. Furthermore, the land purchase is expected to increase the company's annual pretax earnings by $14 million in perpetuity, resulting in a positive impact on the company's market value. By issuing debt, the company can benefit from the tax advantage of interest payments, which are deductible from the company's income, resulting in a reduction in overall tax liability. It is critical to note that the company should not exceed 30% debt, as this would result in a lower bond rating and a much higher coupon rate, potentially leading to financial distress and associated costs.
