It is suggested that Stephenson take on debt to fund the land acquisition. This is due to the fact that the cost of capital would be reduced by issuing debt as opposed to equity. The rate of return that investors anticipate receiving on their equity investment is used to determine the cost of equity capital. Kim Weyand has calculated a cost of capital of 12.5% for the company at present. However, the 8 percent coupon rate on the bonds represents the cost of capital for debt. The cost of debt financing is less than the cost of equity financing for the company. In addition, according to Kim Weyand, the best way to organize a company's finances is to have 70% stock and 30% debt. If the company's financial situation improves, it will be in a better position to issue debt and will face less of a danger of financial distress and the costs that come with it. However, the company's net income and ROI would be reduced due to interest payments on the loan and the 21 percent corporate tax rate. To that end, the corporation needs to weigh the benefits and drawbacks thoroughly before making a choice.
