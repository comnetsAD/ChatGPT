Stephenson Real Estate should borrow to buy land to increase its worth. This recommendation has several reasons: Kim Weyand thinks the corporation can issue bonds at 8%, but its cost of capital is 12.5 percent. The corporation might cut its cost of capital by issuing debt, increasing its net present value and market value. Kim Weyand recommends a 70/30 equity/debt capital structure for the organization. Debt would bring the company closer to this optimal capital structure, increasing its market value. Corporate taxes are 21%.

It's crucial to evaluate the company's debt-service ability and risk profile before making this selection. The corporation should also examine its credit rating and debt payments. To optimize its market worth, Stephenson Real Estate should issue financing to buy land if it can service the debt and maintain its risk profile.
