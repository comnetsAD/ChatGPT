Stephenson Real Estate would benefit from issuing debt to finance the land acquisition so as to maximize its entire market worth. Several factors support this recommendation: Current cost of capital for the company is 12.5%, which is greater than the coupon rate of 8% that Kim Weyand estimates the company can issue bonds at. By issuing debt, the corporation might reduce its cost of capital, so increasing its net present value and, consequently, its market value. Kim Weyand feels that a financial structure of about 70% stock and 30% debt would be optimum for the organization. By borrowing debt, the company might approach this optimal capital structure, so increasing its market value. The company's corporation tax rate is 21 percent. By issuing debt, the company could benefit from the tax deductibility of interest payments, so reducing its effective cost of capital and increasing its market value. It is essential to highlight that this decision should only be made after a thorough analysis of the company's ability to service its debt and its overall risk profile. In addition, the company should evaluate the influence on its credit rating and the costs connected with issuing debt. If the company can service the loan and its overall risk profile is not adversely affected, it would be advantageous for Stephenson Real Estate to issue debt to finance the land acquisition so as to maximize its entire market value.
