It is suggested that Stephenson issue loans to finance the land acquisition. This is due to the fact that issuing debt would yield a cheaper cost of capital than issuing equity. The cost of capital for equities is determined by the expected rate of return on shareholders' investments, which is the company's expected rate of return. In this instance, Kim Weyand has concluded that the current cost of capital for the company is 12.5%. In contrast, the cost of capital for debt is the coupon rate on the bonds, which is 8%. This is less than the company's cost of capital for equity, making the issuance of debt preferable. In addition, Kim Weyand feels that a 70 percent equity/30 percent loan capital structure would be optimum for the organization. It should be emphasized, however, that the corporation would be required to pay interest on the loan and would be subject to a 21 percent corporate tax rate, which would reduce the net income and return on investment. Before making a decision, the corporation should analyze the trade-offs thoroughly.
