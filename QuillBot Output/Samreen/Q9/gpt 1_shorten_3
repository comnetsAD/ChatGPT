To optimize its market value, the corporation should issue debt to buy land. The company's new CFO, Kim Weyand, believes that debt would increase the company's value because its cost of capital is 12.5%. The corporation can issue bonds at par value with an 8% coupon rate, and a capital structure of 70% equity/30% debt is ideal. The land purchase is estimated to boost the company's market value by $14 million in perpetual pretax earnings. The corporation can reduce its tax liabilities by issuing debt because interest payments are tax-deductible. The corporation should not exceed 30% debt because it would reduce its bond grade and increase its coupon rate, causing financial pain and costs.
