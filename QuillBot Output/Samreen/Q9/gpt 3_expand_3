It is strongly recommended that Stephenson take on debt in order to finance the acquisition of the land. This is due to the fact that the cost of capital would be reduced if debt were issued as opposed to equity being issued. The rate of return that investors anticipate receiving on their investments serves as the basis for calculating the cost of equity capital, which is often referred to as the projected rate of return for the company. In this particular scenario, Kim Weyand has arrived at the conclusion that the current cost of capital for the organization is 12.5%. On the other hand, the coupon rate on the bonds is 8%, which means that the cost of capital for debt is equivalent to that rate. Because this is less than the cost of capital that the firm incurs when investing in equity, it is preferable for the corporation to issue debt. In addition, Kim Weyand is of the opinion that the company would benefit most from adopting a financial structure that is composed of 70 percent stock and 30 percent debt. This indicates that the organization would have a decreased risk of financial difficulty as well as the costs that are linked with it, which would also make it more beneficial to issue debt. However, it is important to keep in mind that the corporation would be obligated to make interest payments on the debt and would also be subject to the 21 percent corporate tax rate, both of which would have the effect of reducing the net income as well as the return on investment. As a result, prior to choosing a choice, the organization had to conduct a thorough analysis of the various alternatives.
