In order for Stephenson Real Estate to maximize the land's overall market value, it would be good for the company to issue debt in order to finance the purchase of the property. This advice should be considered for a few different reasons: The cost of capital that is now being incurred by the company is 12.5%, which is more than the coupon rate of 8% that Kim Weyand estimates the company can issue bonds at. The decrease in the company's cost of capital that would result from the issuance of debt would lead to an increase in the company's net present value and, by extension, its market value. Kim Weyand is of the opinion that the company would benefit most from adopting a financial structure that consists of around 70 percent equity and 30 percent debt. The issuance of debt would enable the company to get closer to the ideal capital structure, which would result in a rise in the market value of the business. The overall tax burden for the corporation is twenty-one percent. The company would be able to take advantage of the tax deductibility of interest payments if it issued debt. This would result in a decrease in the company's effective cost of capital as well as a rise in the market value of the company. It is essential to emphasize the fact that this choice should not be taken until after conducting a thorough analysis of the company's total risk profile as well as its capacity to make debt payments on time. In addition to this, the company needs to think about how the potential impact may affect its credit rating as well as the costs connected with issuing debt. In the grand scheme of things, it would be beneficial for Stephenson Real Estate to issue debt in order to finance the purchase of land in order to maximize its total market value. This is provided, of course, that the company can service the debt and that the overall risk profile of the company is not adversely affected in the process.
