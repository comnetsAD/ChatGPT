In order to maximize the land's entire market worth, it would be advised that the corporation issue debt to finance the land purchase. The firm's present cost of capital, which Kim Weyand, the new CFO, calculated to be 12.5%, would increase the firm's value, in her opinion, if debt were included in the capital structure. Additionally, it has been mentioned that a capital structure in the range of 70% equity/30% debt would be ideal and the company can issue bonds at par value with an 8% coupon rate. Additionally, the acquisition of the land is anticipated to permanently improve the company's pretax earnings by $14 million, which will have a beneficial effect on the market value of the business. By issuing debt, the firm can profit from interest payments that are tax deductible from the company's income, lowering the total amount of taxes owed. It's crucial to remember that the business shouldn't have more debt than 30% because doing so would result in a poorer bond rating and a significantly higher coupon rate, which could cause financial difficulties and related expenditures.
