It is suggested that Stephenson issue debt to finance the land purchase. This is due to the fact that issuing debt has a lower cost of capital than issuing equity. The cost of capital for equity is calculated as the expected rate of return on shareholders' investment, which is the company's expected rate of return. Kim Weyand determined that the company's current cost of capital is 12.5 percent in this case. The cost of capital for debt, on the other hand, is the bond coupon rate, which is 8%. This is less than the company's equity cost of capital, making it more advantageous to issue debt. Furthermore, Kim Weyand believes that a capital structure of 70% equity/30% debt would be ideal for the company. This means that the company would be at a lower risk of financial distress and the associated costs, making it more appealing to issue debt. However, it should be noted that the company would be required to pay interest on the debt as well as the corporate tax rate of 21%, which would reduce net income and return on investment. As a result, before making a decision, the company should carefully weigh the trade-offs.
