Stephenson Real Estate would be well-served to maximize its entire market value by issuing debt to finance the land purchase. Several factors support this suggestion: Although Kim Weyand thinks the company can issue bonds at a coupon rate of 8%, the current cost of capital is 12.5%. In order to reduce its cost of capital, the company could issue debt, which would boost its net present value and, ultimately, its market value. Kim Weyand thinks the company would do best with a financing structure that includes roughly 70% equity and 30% debt. In order to achieve this ideal capital structure, the company could issue debt, which would boost its value. The corporation pays a tax rate of 21%. Since interest payments are tax deductible, the company's effective cost of capital would decrease and its market value would rise if it were to issue debt. This choice should be taken only after a thorough analysis of the firm's liquidity, profitability, and risk tolerance. The cost of issuing debt and the potential influence on the company's credit rating are also factors to consider. To maximize its total market value, Stephenson Real Estate would benefit from issuing debt to finance the land purchase, provided the company can pay the debt and the company's risk profile is not adversely damaged.
