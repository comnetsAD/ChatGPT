To increase its overall market worth, Stephenson Real Estate would benefit from issuing debt to pay for the land purchase. This advice is made for the following reasons: Kim Weyand thinks the company can issue bonds at an 8 percent interest rate, while the company's actual cost of capital is 12.5 percent higher. The company may reduce its cost of capital by issuing debt, which would raise its net present value and consequently its market value. Kim Weyand thinks the best financing structure for the company would be somewhere between 70% stock and 30% debt. The corporation could raise its market value by issuing debt in order to get closer to this ideal capital structure. The corporation pays a corporate tax rate of 21%. The company would be able to benefit from the tax benefits of interest payments by issuing debt, which would lower its effective cost of capital and raise its market value. It's crucial to remember that this choice should only be taken after a rigorous analysis of the company's capacity to pay off its debts and its overall risk profile. The business should also take into account the potential effects on its credit rating and the related costs of borrowing loans. Overall, it would be advantageous for Stephenson Real Estate to issue debt to finance the land purchase in order to maximize its total market value, provided the company can service the debt and its overall risk profile is unaffected.
