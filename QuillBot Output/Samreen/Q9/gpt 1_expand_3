It would be advised that the company issue debt in order to finance the land purchase as a means of increasing its total market value. This recommendation is based on the information that was provided. New Chief Financial Officer Kim Weyand has calculated that the company's current cost of capital is 12.5 percent. Weyand is of the opinion that the company's value may be increased if it adopted a capital structure that included a greater proportion of debt. Additionally, it has been said that the corporation is able to issue bonds at par value with a coupon rate of 8%, and that the best capital structure would be somewhere in the region of 70% equity and 30% debt. Additionally, it is anticipated that the acquisition of the land will result in an increase of $14 million in yearly pretax earnings for the company in perpetuity. This will have a favorable effect on the market valuation of the company. Through the issuance of debt, the firm is able to take advantage of the tax benefits associated with interest payments. These interest payments will be deductible from the company's revenue, which will result in a reduction in the overall tax liability. It is essential to keep in mind that the firm should not incur more debt than 30 percent of its total assets. Doing so would result in a poorer bond rating and a significantly higher coupon rate, which could put the company in a precarious financial position and result in additional charges.
