Stephenson Real Estate would benefit from issuing debt to finance the land purchase in order to maximize its total market value. This recommendation is made for several reasons: The current cost of capital for the company is 12.5 percent, which is higher than the coupon rate of 8% that Kim Weyand believes the company can issue bonds at. The company could lower its cost of capital by issuing debt, increasing its net present value and thus its market value. Kim Weyand believes that a capital structure of 70 percent equity/30 percent debt is best for the company. The company would be able to move closer to this optimal capital structure by issuing debt, increasing its market value. The corporation pays a corporate tax rate of 21%. By issuing debt, the company would be able to take advantage of interest payments being tax deductible, lowering its effective cost of capital and increasing its market value. It's important to note that this decision should only be made after a thorough examination of the company's ability to service debt and overall risk profile. Furthermore, the company should consider the potential impact on its credit rating as well as the costs associated with issuing debt. Overall, if the company can service the debt and the company's overall risk profile is not harmed, it would be advantageous for Stephenson Real Estate to issue debt to finance the land purchase in order to maximize its total market value.
