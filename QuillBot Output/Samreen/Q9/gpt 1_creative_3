Using the available data, we conclude that the best course of action is for the corporation to issue debt in order to fund the land purchase. The new chief financial officer, Kim Weyand, has calculated that the firm's cost of capital is 12.5% per annum and has concluded that the incorporation of debt into the capital structure would increase the firm's value. Furthermore, the company can issue bonds at par with a coupon rate of 8%, and a capital structure in the range of 70% equity/30% debt would be appropriate. In addition, the land purchase is anticipated to raise the company's yearly pretax earnings by $14 million in perpetuity, which will have a beneficial effect on the market value of the company. When a business reduces its taxable income by making interest payments on its debt, the interest it pays is said to be "tax deductible." Importantly, the company's debt level should not exceed 30% of its total value because doing so would result in a poorer bond grade and a considerably higher coupon rate, both of which could cause financial trouble and associated expenditures.
