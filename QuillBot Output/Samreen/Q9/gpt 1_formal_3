In order to optimize the land's entire market worth, it would be recommended, based on the information presented, that the corporation issue debt in order to finance the land purchase. New CFO Kim Weyand has estimated that the business's current cost of capital is 12.5% and feels that the company would be more valuable if its capital structure contained debt. In addition, it has been said that the corporation can issue bonds at par value with an 8 percent coupon rate, and that a 70 percent equity/30 percent debt capital structure would be best. Additionally, it is anticipated that the purchase of the land will raise the company's yearly pretax earnings by $14 million in perpetuity, which will have a beneficial effect on the company's market value. By issuing debt, the firm can take advantage of the tax advantage of interest payments, which are deducted from the company's revenue, so reducing its overall tax obligation. Importantly, the corporation should not exceed 30 percent debt, since doing so would result in a poorer bond grade and a considerably higher coupon rate, which could lead to financial difficulties and additional costs.
