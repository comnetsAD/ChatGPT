Stephenson should borrow to buy land. Because debt costs less than equity. Equity's cost of capital is the company's projected rate of return on shareholders' investments. Kim Weyand estimates the company's cost of capital at 12.5%. The debt cost of capital is the bond coupon rate, which is 8%. Debt is cheaper than stock for the organization. Kim Weyand also recommends a 70/30 equity/debt capital structure for the organization. This reduces the company's financial distress risk and costs, making debt issuance more attractive. However, the corporation would have to pay loan interest and the corporate tax rate of 21%, which would diminish net income and return on investment. The corporation should weigh the trade-offs before making a decision.
