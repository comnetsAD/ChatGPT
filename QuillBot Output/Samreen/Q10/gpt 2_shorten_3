We must compute the company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for both the all-equity and 70/30 debt/equity scenarios and compare them to determine which option maximizes Stephenson's equity per share. All-equity scenario: The corporation would finance the project entirely with equity. Calculate this scenario's WACC: WACC = (E/V)*Re + (D/V*Rd* (1-T) Market value of equity (8.7 million shares * $46.50/share = $405.45 million) V = equity+debt market value (405.45 million) Cost of equity (Kim estimates 12.5%) Debt market value (0) Rd=debt cost (0) (21%). WACC = (405.45 million / 405.45 million) * 12.5% = 12.5% 70/30 debt/equity scenario: The corporation would borrow 30% of the project and use equity for 70%. Calculating this scenario's WACC: WACC = (E/V)*Re + (D/V*Rd* (1-T) Market value of equity (8.7 million shares * $46.50/share = $405.45 million) V = equity+debt market value (405.45 million + 65 million * 0.3 = 446.35 million) Cost of equity (Kim estimates 12.5%) Debt market value = 65 million * 0.3 = 19.5 million 8% debt cost Corporate tax rate (21%). Values yield: (405.45 million/446.35 million) WACC 12.5% + (19.5 million/446.35 million) * 8% * (1-0.21) = 11.6% The 70/30 debt/equity scenario has a WACC of 11.6 percent, compared to 12.5 percent for the all-equity scenario. Thus, this financing technique maximizes Stephenson's equity per-share price.
