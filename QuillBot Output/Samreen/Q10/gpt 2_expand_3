We need to calculate the company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for both the all-equity and the 70/30 debt/equity scenarios in order to determine which method of financing will maximize the per-share stock price of Stephenson's equity. We can then compare the two to reach a conclusion regarding which method will achieve this goal. In the case of an all-equity situation, the company would not take on any debt in order to finance the project; rather, they would rely completely and entirely on equity financing. The following formula is used to determine the WACC for this scenario: WACC = (E/V) * Re + (D/V) * Rd * (1-T) Where E represents the current market value of the company's equity (8.7 million shares times $46.50 per share equals $405.45 million), V = market value of equity + market value of debt (405.45 million) Re equals the cost of equity, which Kim estimates to be 12.5% of total assets. D = market value of debt (0) Rd equals the cost of the loan (0) T = corporation tax rate (21%) After entering the inputs, we obtain the following result: WACC = (405.45 million / 405.45 million) * 12.5% = 12.5% The company would rely on equity financing for the remaining 70 percent of the project in the event of a 70/30 debt/equity scenario. In this situation, the company would issue debt to fund 30 percent of the project. The following formula is used to determine the WACC for this scenario: WACC = (E/V) * Re + (D/V) * Rd * (1-T) Where E represents the current market value of the company's equity (8.7 million shares times $46.50 per share equals $405.45 million), V = market value of equity + market value of debt (405.45 million + 65 million * 0.3 = 446.35 million) Re equals the cost of equity, which Kim estimates to be 12.5% of total assets. D = market value of debt (65 million * 0.3 = 19.5 million) Rd = the cost of debt (eight percent). T = corporation tax rate (21%) Plugging in the values, we get: WACC = (405.45 million / 446.35 million) * 12.5% + (19.5 million / 446.35 million) * 8% * (1-0.21) = 11.6% Based on the numbers presented above, we can see that the 70/30 debt/equity scenario produces a WACC that is 11.6 percent lower than the all-equity scenario, which produced a WACC that was 12.5 percent. Therefore, the per-share stock price of Stephenson's equity can be maximized by the use of this kind of financing.
