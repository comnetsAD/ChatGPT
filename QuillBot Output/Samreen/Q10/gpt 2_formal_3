To establish which mode of financing optimizes the per-share stock price of Stephenson's equity, we must compute the company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for both the all-equity and 70/30 debt/equity financing scenarios and then compare them. In this case, the corporation would not issue any debt to finance the project, instead relying entirely on stock financing. The calculation for this scenario's WACC is as follows: WACC = (E/V) * Re + (D/V) * Rd * (1-T) Where: E = equity's market value (8.7 million shares * $46.50 per share = $405,45 million) V = market value of equity + market value of debt (405.45 million) Re = equity cost (estimated by Kim to be 12.5%). D = market value of debt (0) Rd = interest expense (0) T = corporation tax rate (21%) WACC = (405,45 million / 405,5 million) * 12.5% = 12.5% is the result of plugging in the variables. In a 70/30 debt/equity scenario, the company would issue debt to finance 30% of the project while relying on equity financing for the remaining 70%. The calculation for this scenario's WACC is as follows: WACC = (E/V) * Re + (D/V) * Rd * (1-T) Where: E = equity's market value (8.7 million shares * $46.50 per share = $405,45 million) V = market value of equity + market value of debt (405.45 million + 65 million * 0.3 = 446.35 million) Re = equity cost (estimated by Kim to be 12.5%). Rd = (8%) cost of debt T = corporation tax rate (21%) Plugging in the values, we get: WACC = (405.45 million / 446.35 million) * 12.5% + (19.5 million / 446.35 million) * 8% * (1-0.21) = 11.6% According to the estimates above, the 70/30 debt/equity scenario results in a WACC of 11.6 percent, which is lower than the all-equity scenario's WACC of 12.5 percent. Therefore, this mode of funding maximizes Stephenson's stock price per share.
