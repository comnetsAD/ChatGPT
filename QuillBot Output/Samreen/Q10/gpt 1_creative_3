Keeping a capital structure of 70% equity and 30% debt will enhance the per-share stock price of Stephenson's equity. According to Kim Weyand's calculations, the cost of capital for the company is 12.5%, which is greater than the coupon rate of 8% it can earn by issuing bonds. It can enhance its earnings and stock price by issuing debt and taking advantage of the cheaper cost of borrowing. Furthermore, the optimal capital structure balances the danger of financial crisis with the potential increase in earnings by maintaining a 70:30 ratio of stock to debt. An increased debt ratio raises concerns about future financial stability, leading to a lower bond grade and higher coupon rate. Lastly, the corporation can boost its earnings and stock price by issuing debt and retaining a 70/30 capital structure and taking advantage of the corporate tax rate.
