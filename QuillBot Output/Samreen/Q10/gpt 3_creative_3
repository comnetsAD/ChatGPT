If we want to maximize Stephenson's equity value per share, we need to examine the incremental rise in value created by the various financing options and choose the one that yields the largest number. The property purchase will enhance Stephenson's yearly pretax earnings by $14 million permanently, which is more than the cost of the entire project's equity financing combined. When discounted at the firm's cost of capital of 12.5%, the value of future earnings is $112 million ($14 million multiplied by 0.125). With 8.7 million shares in circulation, a $112 million gain in stock price would translate to a per-share value of $12.80. The project can be financed through the issuance of bonds at 8% interest at par value. The cost of capital for the corporation is 12.5%, hence the present value of future earnings is $112 million ($14 million multiplied by 0.125). Interest on the $65 million in debt required to fund the project comes to $5.2 million a year (65 million multiplied by 0.08%). The value of the business would rise by a net of $108.292 million ($112m - $5.2m + $1.092m). Given that there are currently 8.7 million shares outstanding, a $108.292 million rise in stock price would translate to a price of $12.487 per share. It is clear from the preceding calculations that using equity funding for the project only maximizes Stephenson's equity value per share. If debt financing is used to complete the project, the per-share stock price rise will be $12.487 rather than $12.80.
