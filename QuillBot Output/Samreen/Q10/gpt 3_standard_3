We must compute the incremental rise in the company's value from each way of funding and compare them to see which one optimizes the per-share stock price of Stephenson's equity. if the project is only financed by equity, the land purchase is anticipated to permanently raise Stephenson's yearly pretax profits by $14 million. The current value of the predicted earnings is $14 million / 0.125, or $112 million, because the company's cost of capital is 12.5%. The corporation now has 8.7 million outstanding shares of common stock, so the rise in share price would be $112,000,000 / 8.7,000,000 = $12.80 per share. Debt financing the project: The business may issue bonds at par value with an 8% coupon rate. The current value of the predicted earnings is $14 million / 0.125, or $112 million, because the company's cost of capital is 12.5%. To finance the project, the corporation would need to raise $65 million in debt, with the resulting yearly interest payments coming to $65 million multiplied by 0.08 equaling $5.2 million. The interest payments would lower the company's pretax earnings, but they would also provide a tax shelter worth $1.092 million (21% x $5.2 million). The company's worth would have increased by a total of $108.292 million ($112 million minus $5.2 million plus $1.092 million). The corporation now has 8.7 million outstanding shares of common stock, so the rise in share price would be $108.292 million / 8.7 million, or $12.487 per share. It is clear from the calculations above that funding the project with equity only maximizes Stephenson's equity's per-share stock price. If the project is financed using debt, the per-share stock price gain would be $12.487 instead of $12.80.
