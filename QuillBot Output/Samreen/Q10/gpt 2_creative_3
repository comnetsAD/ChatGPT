We need to compute the company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for both the all-equity and the 70/30 debt/equity scenarios and then compare them to find out which mode of financing optimizes the per-share stock price of Stephenson's equity. In an all-equity scenario, the company would rely completely on equity financing for the project rather than issuing any debt. The WACC in this case is determined by: To calculate the WACC, multiply (E/V) by (D/V) by (Rd/V) by (E/V) (1-T) In which E = equity market value (8.7 million shares * $46.50 = $405.45 million). V = Equity Value + Debt Value in the Market (405.45 million) Kim uses 12.5 as his estimate for the cost of equity (Re). The Debt Market Value, or D (0) Debt service, or Rd, is the expense of borrowing money (0) %T is the 21% business tax rate. Using these data, we can calculate the WACC to be 12.5%: WACC = ($405.4M / ($405.4M) * 12.5% = $12.5% 70 percent of the project's cost would be covered by equity investors and 30 percent by debt issued by the corporation. In this case, the WACC is determined by: An equation for the WACC is: WACC = (E/V) * Re + (D/V) * Rd * (1-T) Value of equity, or E (8.7 million shares * $46.50 = $405.45 million) Value (V) = Equity Market Value (65M * 0.3 = 446.35M) + Debt Market Value (405.45M). Cost of equity, or Re (which Kim calculates to be 12.5%), Denoted by "D," the market value of the debt is $19.5 million ($65,000,000 x 0.3 = $19.5,000,000). The Cost of Debt (Rd) is Eight Percent Where T is the tax rate paid by corporations (21%). When we enter in the values, we get: WACC = ($405.451M / ($446.35M) To calculate the percentage, use the formula: * 12.5% + (19.5 million / 446.35 million) * 8% * (1-0.21) = 11.6% Based on the foregoing, we may conclude that the WACC for the 70/30 debt/equity scenario is lower than that for the all-equity scenario (11.6% vs. 12.5%). As a result, the equity value per share for Stephenson is maximized with this financing strategy.
