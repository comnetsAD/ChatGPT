We need to compute the company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for both the all-equity and the 70/30 debt/equity scenarios and then compare the two to see which financing strategy optimizes the per-share stock price of Stephenson's equity. All-equity scenario: In this case, the company would only use equity financing to fund the project and not issue any debt. For this scenario, the WACC is determined as follows: WACC is equal to (E/V)* Re + (D/V)* Rd (1-T) Where E is the market value of the equity (8.7 million shares at a price of $46.50 each equals $405.45 million) V is equal to the market value of the equity and the debt (405.45 million) Re stands for return on equity, which Kim pegs at 12.5%. D is the debt's market value (0) Rd = the debt's cost (0) T = (21%) corporation tax rate By entering the data, we obtain the following formula: WACC = (405.45 million / 405.45 million) * 12.5% = 12.5%. Scenario: The company would issue debt to finance 30% of the project and rely on equity financing for the remaining 70% in this 70/30 debt/equity scenario. For this scenario, the WACC is determined as follows: WACC is equal to (E/V)* Re + (D/V)* Rd (1-T) Where E is the market value of the equity (8.7 million shares at a price of $46.50 each equals $405.45 million) (405.45 million + 65 million * 0.3 = 446.35 million) V = market value of equity + market value of debt Re stands for return on equity, which Kim pegs at 12.5%. D is the market value of the debt (65,000,000 * 0.3 = 19.5,000,000). Rd = Debt Cost (8%) T = (21%) corporation tax rate When we enter the values, we obtain: 405.45 million / 446.35 million = WACC 19.5 million out of 446.35 million = 12.5% * 8% * (1-0.21) = 11.6% We can see from the figures above that the 70/30 debt/equity scenario has a lower WACC of 11.6 percent than the all-equity scenario, which has a WACC of 12.5 percent. As a result, this financing strategy maximizes Stephenson's equity's value per share.
