We need to evaluate the incremental rise in the company's value that results from each way of financing and then compare those results to one another in order to decide which mode of financing will maximize the per-share stock price of Stephenson's equity. The entire project will be financed through equity, and it is anticipated that the purchase of the land will result in an increase of $14 million in yearly pretax earnings for Stephenson for the rest of their lives. Since the cost of capital for the organization is 12.5%, the present value of the anticipated earnings is $14 million divided by 0.125, which equals $112 million. Given that there are 8.7 million shares of the company's common stock in circulation, the rise in the stock price per share would be $112 million divided by 8.7 million, which would equal $12.80 per share. Using debt as a source of funding for the project, the corporation has the option of issuing bonds at face value with a coupon rate of 8%. Since the cost of capital for the organization is 12.5%, the present value of the anticipated earnings is $14 million divided by 0.125, which equals $112 million. In order to finance the project, the corporation would need to acquire debt in the amount of $65 million, and the annual interest payments would be calculated as $5.2 million ($65 million multiplied by 0.08). The interest payments would have the effect of decreasing the company's earnings before taxes; yet, the corporation would benefit from the tax shield that the interest payments would provide (21% of $5.2 million equals $1.092 million). The total value of the corporation would rise to $108.292 million after experiencing a net increase of $108.292 million, which is equal to $112 million less the amount of $5.2 million. Because there are 8.7 million shares of the company's common stock in circulation, the gain in the stock price would translate to $12.487 per share if it were divided by the total market capitalization of $108.292 million. Based on the calculations shown before, it is clear that funding the project with equity only results in an increase in the stock price per share of Stephenson's equity. If the project is financed with equity, the per-share increase in the stock price will be $12.80, whereas if it is financed with debt, the per-share increase would be $12.487.
