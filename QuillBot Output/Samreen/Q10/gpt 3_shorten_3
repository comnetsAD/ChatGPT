We must calculate the additional rise in the company's value from each funding strategy and compare them to find which maximizes Stephenson's equity per share. Financing the project with equity only: The land purchase is estimated to improve Stephenson's annual pretax earnings by $14 million forever. The predicted earnings' current value is $14 million / 0.125 = $112 million because the company's cost of capital is 12.5%. $112 million divided by 8.7 million shares equals $12.80 per share. Debt financing: The corporation can issue 8%-coupon bonds at par value. The predicted earnings' current value is $14 million / 0.125 = $112 million because the company's cost of capital is 12.5%. To finance the project, the corporation would need to borrow $65 million at 0.08 percent, or $5.2 million per year. Interest payments would lower the company's pretax earnings, but the tax shield (21% x $5.2 million = $1.092 million) would help. $108.292 million is the company's net worth growth. $108.292 million divided by 8.7 million shares equals $12.487 per share. From the calculations above, financing the project using equity only maximizes Stephenson's equity per share. The stock price rise would be $12.80 per share, compared to $12.487 per share if the project is financed with debt.
