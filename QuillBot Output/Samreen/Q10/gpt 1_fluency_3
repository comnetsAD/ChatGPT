To maximize the per-share stock price of Stephenson's equity, the company should issue debt to finance the entire project and maintain a capital structure of 70% equity/30% debt. According to Kim Weyand's analysis, the company's cost of capital is 12.5 percent, which is higher than the 8 percent coupon rate obtained by issuing bonds. By issuing debt, the company can take advantage of lower borrowing costs to boost earnings and, ultimately, stock price. Furthermore, a capital structure of 70% equity/30% debt is optimal because it balances the risk of financial distress with the potential for earnings growth. A higher debt-to-equity ratio increases the risk of financial distress, resulting in a lower bond rating and higher coupon rate. Finally, by issuing debt and maintaining a 70/30 capital structure, the company can capitalize on the corporate tax rate to boost earnings and, ultimately, stock price.
