To decide which type of financing maximizes the per-share stock price of Stephenson's equity, we must compute and compare each method's incremental rise in the company's worth. The purchase of the land is anticipated to improve Stephenson's yearly pretax earnings by $14 million in perpetuity if the project is financed solely with equity. The cost of capital for the company is 12.5%, hence the current value of expected earnings is $112 million ($14 million / 0.125). Given that there are 8.7 million outstanding shares of common stock, the per-share stock price gain would be $112 million divided by 8.7 million shares, or $12.80 per share. For debt-based financing of the project, the corporation may issue bonds at par with an 8% coupon rate. The cost of capital for the company is 12.5%, hence the current value of expected earnings is $112 million ($14 million / 0.125). To finance the project, the corporation would require $65 million in debt, with annual interest payments of $5.2 million ($65 million x 0.08%). The interest payments would diminish the company's earnings before taxes, but they would also provide a tax shield of $1,092,000 (21% x $5,2,000,000 = $1,092,000). The net gain in value of the corporation would be $108.292 million ($112 million - $5.2 million + $1.092 million). Given that the corporation has 8.7 million outstanding shares of common stock, the per-share stock price gain would be $108.292 million divided by 8.7 million shares, or $12.48 per share. It can be shown from the calculations above that financing the project through equity merely maximizes Stephenson's per-share stock price. The per-share increase in stock price would be $12.80 compared to $12.487 if the project is financed with debt.
