To maximize the per-share stock price of Stephenson's equity, the business should issue debt to finance the entire project and retain a 70 percent equity, 30 percent debt capital structure. According to Kim Weyand's study, the company's cost of capital is 12.5%, which is more than the 8% coupon rate it can obtain by issuing bonds. By issuing debt, the company can boost its profitability and, ultimately, its stock price by taking advantage of the lower cost of borrowing. Moreover, keeping a capital structure of 70% equity and 30% debt is desirable since it strikes a balance between the danger of financial crisis and the potential for earnings growth. A greater proportion of debt would increase the likelihood of financial trouble, leading to a lower bond rating and a higher coupon rate. Lastly, by issuing debt and retaining a 70/30 capital structure, the company can take advantage of the corporate tax rate to boost its profitability and, ultimately, its stock price.
