To get the greatest possible increase in value for each individual share of Stephenson's equity, the business should completely finance the project through the issuance of debt and keep its capital structure comprised of seventy percent equity and thirty percent debt. According to the findings of Kim Weyand's analysis, the cost of capital for the company is 12.5 percent, which is a higher rate than the 8 percent coupon rate that the company may earn from issuing bonds. Through the issuance of debt, the company is able to take advantage of the reduced cost of borrowing, which will ultimately lead to an increase in both its earnings and its stock price. In addition, the optimal capital structure strikes a balance between the possibility for an increase in earnings and the danger of experiencing financial difficulty. This balance can be achieved by maintaining a capital structure that is composed of 70 percent stock and 30 percent debt. A lower bond grade and a higher coupon rate would be the consequence of a higher percentage of debt, which would also increase the likelihood of experiencing financial trouble. In conclusion, in order for the company to further enhance its profitability and, ultimately, its stock price, it can take advantage of the lower corporation tax rate by retaining a capital structure that is composed of 70 percent debt and 30 percent equity.
