The company should issue debt to fully finance the project and maintain a capital structure of 70% equity/ 30% debt in order to optimize the per-share stock price of Stephenson's equity. According to Kim Weyand's study, the company's cost of capital is 12.5%, which is more than the bond issuer's potential coupon rate of 8%. By issuing debt, the business can benefit from the decreased borrowing costs to boost earnings and ultimately stock price. Furthermore, keeping a capital structure of 70% equity and 30% debt is ideal since it strikes a balance between the danger of financial trouble and the possibility of higher returns. A higher debt to income ratio would raise the danger of financial trouble, lower the bond's rating, and raise the coupon rate. The business can also benefit from the corporate tax rate to boost earnings and ultimately its stock price by raising debt and keeping a 70/30 capital structure.
