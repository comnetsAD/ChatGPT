To determine which method of financing maximizes Stephenson's equity per-share stock price, we must calculate and compare the incremental increase in the company's value from each method of financing. The project will be funded entirely through equity: The purchase of the land is expected to increase Stephenson's annual pretax earnings by $14 million in perpetuity. Because the cost of capital for the company is 12.5%, the present value of the expected earnings is $14 million / 0.125 = $112 million. Because the company has 8.7 million shares of common stock outstanding, the increase in per-share stock price would be $112 million / 8.7 million = $12.80 per share. Debt financing for the project: The company can issue bonds at par with an 8% coupon rate. Because the cost of capital for the company is 12.5%, the present value of the expected earnings is $14 million / 0.125 = $112 million. To finance the project, the company would need to raise $65 million in debt, with annual interest payments of $65 million x 0.08 = $5.2 million. The interest payments would reduce the company's pretax earnings, but it would also benefit from the tax break (21% x $5.2 million = $1.092 million). The net increase in the company's value would be $112 million minus $5.2 million plus $1.092 million, for a total of $108.292 million. Because the company has 8.7 million shares of common stock outstanding, the increase in per-share stock price would be $108.292 million / 8.7 million = $12.487 per share. According to the calculations above, financing the project with equity only maximizes the per-share stock price of Stephenson's equity. The increase in stock price per share would be $12.80, compared to $12.487 if the project is financed with debt.
