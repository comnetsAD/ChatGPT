To determine which method of financing maximizes Stephenson's equity per-share stock price, we must calculate and compare the company's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) for both the all-equity and the 70/30 debt/equity scenarios. All-equity scenario: In this scenario, the company would not issue any debt to fund the project, instead relying entirely on equity financing. For this scenario, the WACC is calculated as follows: (E/V) * Re + (D/V) * Rd * WACC (1-T) Where E = equity market value (8.7 million shares * $46.50/share = $405.45 million) V = equity market value + debt market value (405.45 million) Re = equity cost (Kim estimates it to be 12.5%). D = debt market value (0) Rd = debt cost (0) T is the corporate tax rate (21%). With the values entered, we get: WACC = (405.45 million / 405.45 million) * 12.5% = 12.5% 70/30 debt/equity scenario: In this scenario, the company would issue debt to finance 30% of the project and use equity to fund the remaining 70%. For this scenario, the WACC is calculated as follows: (E/V) * Re + (D/V) * Rd * WACC (1-T) Where E = equity market value (8.7 million shares * $46.50/share = $405.45 million) V = equity market value + debt market value (405.45 million + 65 million * 0.3 = 446.35 million) Re = equity cost (Kim estimates it to be 12.5%). D = debt market value (65 million * 0.3 = 19.5 million) Rd = debt cost (8%) T is the corporate tax rate (21%). When we plug in the values, we get: (405.45 million / 446.35 million) WACC * (19.5 million / 446.35 million) x 12.5% * 8% * (1-0.21) = 11.6% According to the above calculations, the 70/30 debt/equity scenario has a lower WACC of 11.6 percent than the all-equity scenario, which has a WACC of 12.5 percent. As a result, this method of financing maximizes Stephenson's equity's per-share stock price.
