If Conch Republic loses sales on existing models due to the debut of the new model, the financial analysis of the new smartphone will be significantly impacted. The predicted sales volumes used in the study would certainly drop, resulting in a reduction in expected income and an increase in projected expenses. This would likely reduce the net present value of the new smartphone, making the project less lucrative or unprofitable. In addition, it might reduce the payback time and boost the internal rate of return. In order to provide an appropriate evaluation of the new smartphone's profitability and potential for success, the loss of sales on existing models must be addressed and compensated for in the financial analysis.
