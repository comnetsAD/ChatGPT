If Conch Republic loses sales on previous models due to the introduction of the new model, the analysis will be significantly impacted. The corporation may not be able to recuperate the costs connected with creating and marketing the new model if the anticipated sales statistics for the new smartphone fall short of expectations. Additionally, the operation's fixed expenses may be higher than anticipated if the company is unable to produce sufficient income from the new model to offset these costs. In addition, the depreciation schedule for the equipment and the net working capital would be impacted, resulting in a decrease in the net present value and an increase in the payback period. Overall, the new smartphone model would be less profitable for the corporation and may not be a worthwhile investment.
