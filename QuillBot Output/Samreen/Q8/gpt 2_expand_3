The study would be negatively impacted in the event that Conch Republic experienced a decrease in sales of other models as a direct result of the launch of the new model. It is possible that the corporation may not be able to repay the costs connected with producing and marketing the new model because the anticipated sales statistics for the new smartphone may not be as high as the initial estimates said they would be. In addition, it is possible that the fixed expenses connected with the operation will be greater than originally projected if the company is unable to produce sufficient revenue from the new model to offset these costs. Additionally, the depreciation schedule for the equipment as well as the net working capital would be changed, leading to a lower net present value and a longer payback period as a result of the changes. The release of the new smartphone model would, on the whole, result in lower profits for the business, and it is possible that this would not be a good investment.
