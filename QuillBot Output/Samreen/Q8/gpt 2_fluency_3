If Conch Republic loses sales on other models as a result of the release of the new model, the analysis will suffer. The predicted sales statistics for the new smartphone may be lower than expected, and the corporation may not be able to recuperate the expenditures of producing and promoting the new model. Furthermore, if the firm is unable to produce enough income from the new model to cover these expenditures, the fixed costs connected with the operation may be greater than planned. Furthermore, the equipment depreciation schedule and net working capital would be altered, resulting in a lower net present value and a longer payback time. Overall, the new smartphone model would be less lucrative for the corporation and may not be a feasible investment.
