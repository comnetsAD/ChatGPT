In the event that Conch Republic's existing model sales drop as a result of the release of the new model, the results of the analysis will be negatively affected. That's because it's likely that the new smartphone won't sell as well as expected, leading to less money in the bank. Also, the company's fixed costs would stay the same, which would drive up the price of the new smartphone and reduce profits even further. If actual sales are lower than anticipated, the corporation will need to revise its financial forecasts. The company's bottom line could be negatively affected by the missed sales of other models, thus accounting for such expenditures is essential.
