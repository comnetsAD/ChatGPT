If Conch Republic loses sales on previous models due to the introduction of the new model, the analysis will be negatively affected. This is due to the likelihood that the predicted sales figures for the new smartphone would be lower than the original projections, resulting in lesser revenue and possibly lower profits for the company. Additionally, the operation's fixed expenditures would remain unchanged, which would increase the unit cost of the new smartphone and further reduce profitability. The corporation must reevaluate the anticipated sales figures and revise its financial forecasts accordingly. Additionally, they would need to evaluate the costs associated with lost sales of other models and the potential impact on the company's bottom line.
