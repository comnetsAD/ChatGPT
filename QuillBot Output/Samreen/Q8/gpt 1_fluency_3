If Conch Republic loses sales on previous models as a result of the release of the new model, the financial analysis of the new smartphone will suffer. The expected sales quantities utilized in the research would most likely drop, lowering projected income and increasing projected expenditures. This would very certainly reduce the new smartphone's net present value, perhaps making the project less lucrative or unprofitable. It may also shorten the payback time and boost the internal rate of return. Overall, the loss of sales on older models must be addressed and compensated for in the new smartphone's financial analysis in order to create an appropriate evaluation of its profitability and prospective success.
