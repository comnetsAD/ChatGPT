In the event that Conch Republic experiences a decrease in sales of its existing models as a direct result of the launch of the new model, this will have a negative effect on the analysis. This is due to the fact that the predicted sales statistics for the new smartphone are likely to be lower than the original forecasts, which would result in reduced revenue and possibly fewer profits for the company. Specifically, the reason for this is as follows: In addition, the fixed costs associated with the operation would be maintained at their current levels, which would result in a rise in the cost per unit associated with the new smartphone and a further decline in profitability. The corporation would need to reevaluate the anticipated sales statistics and make appropriate adjustments to the financial predictions in accordance with the new information. They would also need to evaluate the costs connected with the missed sales on other models as well as the potential revenue impact that this would have on the company's bottom line in order to properly prepare for this scenario.
