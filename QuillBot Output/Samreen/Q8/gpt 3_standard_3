The release of the new model could hurt Conch Republic's sales of existing models, which would be bad for the analysis. This is due to the likelihood that actual sales of the new smartphone will fall short of projections, which would result in reduced revenue and perhaps even lower profitability for the business. The operation's fixed costs would also stay the same, driving up the price per unit of the new smartphone and further reducing profitability. The corporation would have to reassess the anticipated sales numbers and modify the financial predictions as necessary. They would also need to take into account the costs of the lost sales on other models and the potential revenue impact on the bottom line of the business.
