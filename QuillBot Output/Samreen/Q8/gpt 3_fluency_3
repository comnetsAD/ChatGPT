If Conch Republic loses sales on other models as a result of the new model's introduction, the analysis will suffer. This is because the new smartphone's projected sales figures are likely to be lower than the original estimates, resulting in lower revenue and potentially lower profits for the company. Furthermore, the fixed costs of the operation would remain constant, raising the cost per unit of the new smartphone and further reducing profitability. The company would have to reassess its expected sales figures and revise its financial projections accordingly. They would also need to consider the costs associated with lost sales on other models, as well as the potential revenue impact on the company's bottom line.
