Conch Republic's analysis would be impacted adversely if sales of existing models decreased as a result of the new model's debut. The anticipated sales statistics for the new smartphone can fall short of expectations, and the business would not be able to recuperate the resources incurred in creating and promoting the new model. Additionally, if the business is unable to produce enough income from the new model to cover these expenditures, the operation's fixed costs may end up being greater than expected. Additionally, the equipment depreciation schedule and the net working capital would be impacted, which would lead to a lower net present value and a longer payback time. Overall, the corporation would make less money from the launch of the new smartphone model, making it a questionable investment.
