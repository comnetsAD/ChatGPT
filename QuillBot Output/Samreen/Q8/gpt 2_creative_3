The release of a new model could hurt Conch Republic's bottom line if it causes a decline in sales of older versions. The corporation may not be able to recuperate the costs connected with producing and marketing the new smartphone model if sales are lower than planned. If the business is unable to make enough money from the new model, the fixed costs of running the operation will be considerably higher than originally estimated. The equipment depreciation schedule and the net working capital would also be impacted, reducing the net present value and increasing the payback period. The company's bottom line would take a hit if it were to invest in the launch of the new smartphone model.
