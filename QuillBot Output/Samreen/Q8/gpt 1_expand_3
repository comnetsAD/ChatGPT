In the event that Conch Republic experiences a drop in sales of existing models as a direct result of the launch of the new model, this will have an adverse effect on the financial analysis of the new smartphone. It is possible that the expected sales volumes that were used in the study would drop, which will result in a reduction in the forecast income and an increase in the projected expenditures. Because of this, the net present value of the new smartphone is likely going to go down, which might make the project less viable or perhaps unprofitable. In addition to this, it has the potential to shorten the payback time while simultaneously raising the internal rate of return. In general, the decline in sales of previous models would have to be taken into consideration and included into the financial analysis of the new smartphone in order to arrive at an appropriate evaluation of the device's potential for profitability and success.
