It is challenging to draw firm conclusions regarding Tad's expansion intentions from the few financial data presented. However, it seems that the business does not have a good track record of keeping thorough financial records or producing reliable earnings. Furthermore, it is unclear from the information given whether the business has access to money or enough liquidity to finance the development. Tad should therefore thoroughly weigh the advantages and disadvantages of the expansion as well as assess and better grasp the company's financial situation before making a choice.
