Given the little amount of financial information that has been presented, it is challenging to arrive at a conclusive assessment of Tad's expansion plans. On the other hand, it would appear that the company does not have a solid track record of successfully maintaining comprehensive financial records or consistently making profits. In addition, it is not quite clear from the information that has been supplied whether or not the company has adequate liquidity or access to sufficient money to support the development. Before making a choice, it would be smart for Tad to examine and have a better understanding of the company's financial status as well as thoroughly assess the potential risks and rewards of the expansion.
