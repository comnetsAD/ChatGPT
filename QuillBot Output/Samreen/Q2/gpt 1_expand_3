Concerns may also be raised regarding the company's capacity to effectively manage the increased expenses and obligations that come with opening a new store and distributing surfboards to other retailers. Before moving forward with the growth plans, it would be vital for Tad and Jameson to thoroughly analyze all of the potential hazards, including these and any others that may arise.
