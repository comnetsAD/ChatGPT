Regarding Tad's expansion intentions, it is difficult to draw a firm judgement based on the minimal financial facts presented. The company does not appear to have a great track record of keeping detailed financial records or generating consistent earnings. In addition, it is unclear from the available information whether the company has adequate liquidity or access to financing to support the expansion. Before making a decision, it would be smart for Tad to evaluate and have a better understanding of the company's financial status and the potential risks and rewards of the expansion.
