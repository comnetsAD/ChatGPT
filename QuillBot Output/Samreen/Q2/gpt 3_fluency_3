According to the information provided, Sunset Boards' financial situation appears to be stable, and the company has a positive cash flow. However, without more detailed financial information, it's difficult to assess the company's overall financial health and draw conclusions about expansion plans. Before making any recommendations to Tad about the company's expansion plans, I would recommend that Jameson, the financial analyst, conduct a more detailed analysis of the company's financials. It is critical to consider the company's liquidity, profitability, and solvency, as well as market conditions, competition, and expansion capacity.
