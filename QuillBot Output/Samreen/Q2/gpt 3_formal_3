It appears, based on the information supplied, that Sunset Boards' financial status is steady and that the company has a positive cash flow. However, without more precise financial information, it is difficult to analyze the company's overall financial health and to reach a decision regarding the expansion ambitions. Before making comments to Tad regarding the expansion plans, I would suggest that the financial analyst, Jameson, undertake a more thorough review of the company's financials. Consider the company's liquidity, profitability, and solvency, as well as market circumstances, competition, and expansion capacity.
