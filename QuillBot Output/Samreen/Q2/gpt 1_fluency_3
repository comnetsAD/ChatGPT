It is difficult to fully evaluate Tad's expansion plans without a detailed analysis of the company's financial statements and cash flows. However, some potential issues that may arise are as follows: The lack of financial record keeping and organization at the company may make it difficult to obtain funding from new investors or banks. The current profitability and cash flow of the company may not be sufficient to support the expansion plans. The company's ability to manage the additional costs and responsibilities of opening a new store and supplying surfboards to other sellers may also be a source of concern. Before proceeding with the expansion plans, Tad and Jameson should carefully consider these and other potential risks.
