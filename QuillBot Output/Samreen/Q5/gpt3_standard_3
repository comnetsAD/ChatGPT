It is derived by multiplying the retention ratio by the return on equity. The highest rate of growth a business can experience without having to raise more money is known as the sustainable growth rate. It is determined by multiplying the return on equity by the retention ratio and dividing the result by the dividend payout ratio. The internal growth rate of S&S Air is 9.93% x (1-0.0906), or 9.04%.
