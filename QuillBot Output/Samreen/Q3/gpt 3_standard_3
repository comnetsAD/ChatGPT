Depending on the precise goals and objectives of the organization, Boeing may or may not be a good candidate company for S&S Air. While S&S Air specializes in light aircraft for individual owners and pilots, Boeing is a sizable, well-known firm that manufactures commercial aircraft. Although Boeing may have good financial results, given the varied markets and operations, it might not be directly comparable to S&S Air. Comparing S&S Air's performance to those of other manufacturers of light aircraft would be more appropriate.
