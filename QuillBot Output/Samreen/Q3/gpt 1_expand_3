Whether or if S&S Air decides to go with Boeing as an aspirant company is contingent on the particular goals and objectives it has set for itself. Even though Boeing is a well-known and well-respected firm in the aerospace sector, comparing it to a small niche company like S&S Air, which specialized on light airplanes for individual customers, is perhaps not the best analogy that can be made. A competitor firm in the industry of light airplane production that is roughly the same size as the aspirant company would probably be the best choice.
