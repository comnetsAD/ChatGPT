Whether or not Boeing is a suitable aspirant company for S&S Air is dependent on the company's specific goals and objectives. Boeing is a large, well-established company that manufactures commercial aircraft, whereas S&S Air manufactures light airplanes for individual owners and pilots. While Boeing has a strong financial performance, due to the differences in markets and operations, it may not be directly comparable to S&S Air. It would be more appropriate to compare S&S Air's performance to that of other light airplane manufacturers.
