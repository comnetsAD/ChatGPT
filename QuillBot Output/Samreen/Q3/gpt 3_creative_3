Whether or whether Boeing is a good fit for S&S Air's aspirant company depends on the airline's individual goals and aspirations. S&S Air is a small, family-run business that caters to private pilots and aircraft owners, while Boeing is a well-established industry leader in the production of commercial jetliners. Boeing may have had a successful fiscal year, but the two companies may not be directly comparable due to their distinct target markets and business strategies. S&S Air's success is better measured against its peers in the light airplane manufacturing sector.
