The suitability of Boeing as an aspirant company for S&S Air depends on the company's specific goals and ambitions. Boeing is a huge, well-established manufacturer of commercial aircraft, whereas S&S Air specializes on light airplanes for private owners and pilots. Due to the diverse markets and operations, Boeing's financial performance may not be directly comparable to that of S&S Air. It would be more appropriate to compare S&S Air's performance to that of other manufacturers of light aircraft.
