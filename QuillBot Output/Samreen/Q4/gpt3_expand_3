When we evaluate S&S Air's performance in relation to that of the industry, we find that the firm's current ratio falls below the bottom quartile of the industry's range. This suggests that the company might not have sufficient current assets to meet its short-term liabilities. It may be deduced from the fact that the quick ratio, the cash ratio, and the total debt ratio are all lower than the lowest quartile of the industry that the company may have trouble meeting its short-term obligations. On the other hand, the inventory turnover and receivables turnover ratios for the company are both greater than the upper quartile of the industry, which indicates that the company is effectively managing its inventory and collecting on its accounts receivable. It may be deduced from the fact that both the return on assets and the return on equity are more than the upper quartile of the industry's range for those metrics that the business is successful in maximizing the return it receives on both its assets and its equity. If we were to analyze the ratio of S&S Air's inventory to its current liabilities, we would find that it is relatively low in comparison to the typical ratio for the industry. This would imply that the company has a relatively low level of liquidity and that it may not have sufficient current assets to satisfy its short-term liabilities. Moreover, this would suggest that the company has a relatively low level of liquidity.
