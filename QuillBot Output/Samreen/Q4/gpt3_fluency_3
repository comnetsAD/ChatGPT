When we compare S&S Air's performance to the industry, we can see that the company's current ratio is lower than the industry's lower quartile, indicating that the company may not have enough current assets to cover its short-term liabilities. The quick ratio, cash ratio, and total debt ratio are also lower than the industry's lower quartile, indicating that the company may struggle to meet its short-term obligations. The inventory turnover and receivables turnover ratios, on the other hand, are higher than the industry's upper quartile, indicating that the company is efficiently managing its inventory and collecting on its accounts receivable. Return on assets and return on equity are also higher than the industry's upper quartile, indicating that the company generates a high return on its assets and equity. If we calculate the inventory-to-current-liabilities ratio, S&S Air's ratio is lower than the industry average. This would imply that the company has a low level of liquidity and may lack sufficient current assets to cover its short-term liabilities.
