A current ratio below the industry median indicates that S&S Air may not have sufficient liquid assets to meet its short-term obligations, as measured by the interest rate on short-term debt. In addition to being in the bottom 25% in the industry, the company's quick ratio, cash ratio, and total debt ratio all suggest it may struggle to meet its short-term obligations. However, the company's inventory turnover and receivables turnover ratios are also above the industry average, demonstrating effective inventory management and timely collections. Both the return on assets and the return on equity are above the industry's top 25%, showing that the company is profitable. S&S Air has a low inventory to current liability ratio compared to similar businesses in the market. This would indicate that the company's liquidity is poor and that its current assets are insufficient to satisfy its short-term liabilities.
