Without seeing the spreadsheet, deciding whether or not the company should start mining would be a guess. The proposed mine's payback period, IRR, MIRR, and NPV could all be found in the spreadsheet. Using these numbers, we might determine whether or not it would be financially viable to open the mine. It is important to remember that the company's target rate of return is 12%, therefore if the mine's IRR or MIRR is better than that, it is a smart investment.
