We can make a recommendation on whether the company should open the mine based on an analysis of the payback period, internal rate of return, modified internal rate of return, and net present value of the proposed mine. If the payback period is shorter than the mine's expected life, it may be a good investment. If the IRR is greater than the required return rate of 12%, it is a good investment. If the MIRR is greater than the required return rate of 12%, it is a good investment. If the NPV is positive, the investment is considered to be a good one. Based on these calculations, if the payback period is less than four years, the IRR is greater than 12%, the MIRR is greater than 12%, and the NPV is positive, the company should open the mine.
