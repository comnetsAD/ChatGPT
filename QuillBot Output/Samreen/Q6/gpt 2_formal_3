On the basis of the planned mine's payback period, internal rate of return, adjusted internal rate of return, and net present value, we can recommend whether or not the corporation should open the mine. If the payback period is less than the estimated life of the mine, the investment might be deemed profitable. If the IRR exceeds the requisite return rate of 12%, the investment can be deemed profitable. If the MIRR exceeds the needed return rate of 12%, the investment can be considered profitable. If the NPV is positive, the investment can be termed profitable. If the payback period is less than four years, the IRR is larger than twelve percent, the MIRR is greater than twelve percent, and the net present value is positive, it can be regarded a solid investment, and the firm should open the mine.
