Without having access to the spreadsheet, it would be challenging to determine whether or not the corporation should start operating the mine based on the analysis. The payback term, internal rate of return, modified internal rate of return, and net present value of the proposed mine would all be displayed on the spreadsheet. These calculations would provide us with a more accurate picture of the financial viability of the mine, which would in turn assist us in determining whether or not to open it. However, it is important to keep in mind that the needed return for the firm is 12%; in this case, the mine is considered a solid investment if the IRR or MIRR is more than 12%.
