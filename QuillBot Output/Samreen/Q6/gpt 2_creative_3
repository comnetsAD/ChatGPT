We can advise the corporation on whether or not to launch the mine by calculating its payback time, IRR, MIRR, and net present value. Consider a mine investment successful if its payback period is shorter than the mine's estimated life. Investment quality is shown if the internal rate of return (IRR) is greater than the minimum acceptable rate of return (ROR), which is set at 12%. A good investment is one where the internal rate of return (IRR) is greater than the minimum acceptable rate of return (ROR). If the net present value is positive, then the investment is likely worthwhile. If the payback period is less than four years, the IRR is larger than twelve percent, the MIRR is greater than twelve percent, and the net present value is positive, then the mine should be opened by the corporation because it is a worthwhile investment.
