We can advise the company on opening the mine based on its payback duration, internal rate of return, modified internal rate of return, and net present value. Good investments have a payback period shorter than the mine's estimated lifespan. Good investments have an IRR greater than 12%. Good investments have a MIRR greater than 12%. Good investments have positive NPVs. These estimates indicate that the mine should be opened if the payback period is less than 4 years, the IRR and MIRR are greater than 12%, and the NPV is positive.
