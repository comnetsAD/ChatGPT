Without access to the spreadsheet, it would be difficult to determine whether the firm should open the mine based on the analysis. The spreadsheet would display the planned mine's payback period, internal rate of return, modified internal rate of return, and net present value. These estimates would give us a better picture of the mine's financial viability and help us decide whether or not to open it. It is important to note, however, that the company's necessary rate of return is 12%; if the IRR or MIRR is higher than this, the mine is a smart investment.
