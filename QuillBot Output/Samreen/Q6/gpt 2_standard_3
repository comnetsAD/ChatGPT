We can suggest whether the company should open the mine based on our study of the payback period, internal rate of return, modified internal rate of return, and net present value of the proposed mine. A favorable investment can be made if the payback period is less time than the mine's anticipated life. A solid investment can be made if the IRR is better than the needed return rate of 12%. A good investment can be made if the MIRR is higher than the needed return rate of 12%. A solid investment can be made if the NPV is positive. According to these estimates, the mine should be opened by the company if the payback period is fewer than four years, the IRR is higher than 12%, the MIRR is higher than 12%, and the NPV is positive.
