Without the spreadsheet, it would be hard to say if the firm should open the mine based on the analysis. The spreadsheet shows the proposed mine's payback period, internal rate of return, modified internal rate of return, and net present value. These calculations would help us decide whether to open the mine based on its financial viability. The mine is a solid investment if the IRR or MIRR is higher than the company's mandated return of 12%.
