Without access to the spreadsheet, it would be difficult to determine if the corporation should start the mining based on the data. The spreadsheet would provide us with the planned mine's net present value, internal rate of return, modified internal rate of return, and payback period. These calculations would help us decide whether to open the mine by providing a clearer picture of its financial viability. It is important to keep in mind that the mine is a solid investment if the IRR or MIRR is better than the company's mandated return of 12%.
