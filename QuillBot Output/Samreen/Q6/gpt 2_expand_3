We are able to provide a recommendation to the corporation regarding whether or not they should start up the mine after conducting an analysis of the payback period, internal rate of return, modified internal rate of return, and net present value of the proposed mine. It is possible that the mine will be a profitable investment provided that the payback period is shorter than the anticipated life of the mine. If the internal rate of return (IRR) is more than the needed return rate of 12%, then the investment might be a good one to make. If the modified internal rate of return (MIRR) is higher than the needed return rate of 12%, then the investment might be a good one to make. If the net present value (NPV) comes out positive, then there is potential for the investment to be profitable. If the payback period is fewer than four years, the internal rate of return (IRR) is greater than 12%, the marginal internal rate of return (MIRR) is larger than 12%, and the net present value (NPV) is positive, then it can be regarded a solid investment, and the firm ought to open the mine.
