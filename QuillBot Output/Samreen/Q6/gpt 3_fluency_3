Without access to the spreadsheet, it would be difficult to say whether the company should open the mine based on the analysis. The spreadsheet would provide us with the proposed mine's payback period, internal rate of return, modified internal rate of return, and net present value. These calculations would provide us with a better understanding of the mine's financial viability and assist us in deciding whether or not to open it. It is worth noting, however, that the company's required return is 12%; if the IRR or MIRR is greater than that, the mine is a good investment.
