In the software, adding from the right to the left results in more accuracy than adding from the left to the right. This is because when adding from right to left, bigger numbers are added first, and these values have less relative inaccuracy than smaller ones. When adding from left to right, the little numbers are added first, and their relative inaccuracy is greater. When adding a series of integers, numerical mistakes build in a manner determined by the order of the additions. This is because floating-point arithmetic is not associative. As a consequence, the order of additions might have an effect on the final output. The series is an alternating harmonic series in the program, the total is log(2), and the order of the integers counts. The relative inaccuracy is reduced and the final result is more accurate by adding the larger numbers first and the smallest ones last. When the program is executed, it is noted that the result obtained by adding from right to left is closer to the predicted value of log(2) than the result obtained by adding from left to right.
