Adding from left to right produces a lower accuracy in the program than adding from right to left. This happens because little values are added first when adding from left to right, and small values are more prone to relative inaccuracy than bigger numbers. The bigger numbers are added first and have less relative error when adding from right to left. The amount of numerical mistakes while adding a series of numbers depends on the order in which they are added. Because floating-point arithmetic is not associative, this occurs. As a consequence, the ultimate outcome may vary depending on the order of additions. The software uses an alternating harmonic series, log(2) as the total, and the sequence of the digits is important. The relative inaccuracy is reduced and the outcome is more accurate by adding the biggest numbers first and the smallest ones last.
