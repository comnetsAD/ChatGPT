When using the application, it is more accurate to add numbers from the right to the left rather than from the left to the right. The reason for this is because while adding from right to left, the bigger values are added first, and because of this, the relative error associated with these numbers is lower than the error associated with the smaller values. When adding from left to right, the smaller numbers are added first, and because of this, the relative error for these smaller values is much bigger. When adding a series of integers, the accumulation of numerical mistakes occurs in a manner that differs depending on the order in which the additions are performed. This is because arithmetic done with floating-point numbers does not follow the rules of associativity. Therefore, the sequence in which components are added might have an impact on the overall output. The sequence in the program is an alternating harmonic series, the total of which is log(2), and the order in which the numbers are presented is significant. When adding up a set of numbers, it's best to start with the highest number and work your way down to the lowest one. This will help reduce relative inaccuracy and get a more precise total. When the program is executed, it is possible to see that the result received from adding from right to left is far closer to the predicted value of log(2) than the result obtained from adding from left to right is. This is something that can be noticed.
