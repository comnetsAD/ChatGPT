The application is less accurate when adding from left to right. When adding from left to right, tiny numbers are added first and have a higher relative inaccuracy than bigger ones. From right to left, bigger numbers are added first and have less relative inaccuracy. Numbers added in order accumulate numerical mistakes. Floating-point arithmetic is not associative. Thus, adding order affects the outcome. The program uses an alternating harmonic series with a log(2) total. Number order matters. Adding the biggest numbers first and the lowest ones last reduces relative inaccuracy and improves accuracy.
