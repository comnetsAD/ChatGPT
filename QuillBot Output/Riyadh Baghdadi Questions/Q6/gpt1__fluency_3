In the software, adding from left to right produces less accurate results than adding from right to left. This is because when adding from left to right, tiny numbers are added first, and small values have a higher relative inaccuracy than bigger ones. When adding from right to left, the bigger numbers are added first, and their relative inaccuracy is lower. When adding a series of integers, numerical mistakes build in a manner determined by the order of the additions. This is because floating-point arithmetic is not associative. As a consequence, the order of additions might have an effect on the final output. The series is an alternating harmonic series in the program, the total is log(2), and the order of the integers counts. The relative inaccuracy is reduced and the final result is more accurate by adding the larger numbers first and the smallest ones last.
