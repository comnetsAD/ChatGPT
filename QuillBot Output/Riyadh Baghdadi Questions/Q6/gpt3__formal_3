In the software, adding from the right to the left is more precise than adding from the left to the right. When adding from right to left, the bigger numbers are added first, and these values have a lower relative inaccuracy than the smaller ones. When adding from left to right, the smaller numbers are added first, and their relative inaccuracy is greater. When adding a series of integers, the accumulation of numerical mistakes relies on the order of the additions. This is owing to the non-associative nature of floating-point arithmetic. Consequently, the sequence of additions might have an impact on the ultimate output. The series in the program is an alternating harmonic series, whose total is log(2), and the order of the integers is significant. By adding the biggest integers first and then the lowest, relative inaccuracy is reduced and the final result is more accurate. When the program is executed, it is noted that the result obtained by adding from right to left is closer to the predicted value of log(2) than the result obtained by adding from left to right.
