Floating-point arithmetic is not associative, therefore the program's sequence of addition might impact the outcome. The sequence in which numbers are added might affect how mistakes accumulate in the final output. When adding from left to right, tiny numbers are added first and have more relative inaccuracy than bigger ones. When inserted initially, tiny numbers increase mistake. From right to left, bigger numbers are added first and have less relative inaccuracy. When inserted initially, greater numbers reduce error. This program adds an alternating series with a total of 0. Number order matters. Thus, adding from right to left minimizes relative error from tiny numbers.
