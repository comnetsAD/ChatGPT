In the software, addition from left to right is less precise than addition from right to left. This is because, when adding from left to right, tiny numbers are added first, and small values are more susceptible to relative inaccuracy than bigger ones. When adding from right to left, the greater numbers are added first, and their relative inaccuracy is less. When adding a series of integers, the accumulation of numerical mistakes relies on the order of the additions. This is owing to the non-associative nature of floating-point arithmetic. Consequently, the sequence of additions might have an impact on the ultimate output. The series in the program is an alternating harmonic series, whose total is log(2), and the order of the integers is significant. By adding the biggest integers first and then the lowest, relative inaccuracy is reduced and the final result is more accurate.
