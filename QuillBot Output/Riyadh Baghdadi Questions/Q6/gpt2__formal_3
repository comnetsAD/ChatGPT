Due to the fact that floating-point arithmetic is not associative, the order in which the integers are added in the program may effect the final output. This indicates that the sequence in which the numbers are added might affect the accumulation of mistakes in the final result. When adding from left to right, the smaller numbers are added first, and their relative inaccuracy is greater than that of the bigger ones. This indicates that when little numbers are added initially, more error is introduced into the final result. When adding from right to left, the greater numbers are added first, and their relative inaccuracy is less. When the bigger numbers are added first, they inject less inaccuracy into the final result. In this program, the series being added is an alternating series with a total of zero, therefore the order of the integers is significant. Consequently, adding from right to left yields a more precise answer, since the relative inaccuracy provided by tiny numbers is decreased by adding the bigger values first.
