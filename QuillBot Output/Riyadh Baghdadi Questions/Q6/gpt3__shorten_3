Right-to-left addition is more accurate in the software. When adding from right to left, bigger numbers are added first and have less relative error than smaller ones. Small numbers are added first and have higher relative inaccuracy when adding from left to right. Numbers added in order accumulate numerical mistakes. Floating-point arithmetic is not associative. Thus, adding order affects the outcome. The program uses an alternating harmonic series with a log(2) total. Number order matters. Adding the biggest numbers first and the lowest ones last reduces relative inaccuracy and improves accuracy. When the program is executed, the right-to-left result is closer to log(2) than the left-to-right result.
