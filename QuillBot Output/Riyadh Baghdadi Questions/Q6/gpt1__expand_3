Adding numbers in the program from left to right results in less accurate results than adding numbers from right to left does. The reason for this is that, while adding from left to right, the smaller numbers are added first, and because of this, relative inaccuracy is more likely to occur with the smaller values than it is with the bigger ones. When adding from right to left, the bigger values are added first, and the relative error for these numbers is lower since they were added first. When adding a series of integers, the accumulation of numerical mistakes occurs in a manner that differs depending on the order in which the additions are performed. This is because arithmetic done with floating-point numbers does not follow the rules of associativity. Therefore, the sequence in which components are added might have an impact on the overall output. The sequence in the program is an alternating harmonic series, the total of which is log(2), and the order in which the numbers are presented is significant. When adding up a set of numbers, it's best to start with the highest number and work your way down to the lowest one. This will help reduce relative inaccuracy and get a more precise total.
