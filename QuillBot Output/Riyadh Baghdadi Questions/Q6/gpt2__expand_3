Because floating-point arithmetic is not associative, the final outcome of the program might be affected by the order in which the numbers are added. This is because of the fact that the program. This indicates that the sequence in which the numbers are added might affect the manner in which mistakes build up in the total result. When adding from left to right, the smaller numbers are added first, and because of this, relative inaccuracy is more likely to occur with the smaller values than it is with the bigger ones. When the smaller numbers are added first, this results in a greater amount of inaccuracy being introduced into the overall calculation. When adding from right to left, the bigger values are added first, and the relative error for these numbers is lower since they were added first. When the bigger numbers are added first, it results in a final product with a lower overall error rate since the larger values are more accurate. The sequence of the integers is significant in this particular application because the series that is being added is an alternating series that has a total of 0. Therefore, adding from right to left produces a more accurate result because the relative inaccuracy brought about by the little numbers is decreased by adding the bigger values first. This is because adding from right to left produces a result that is more correct.
