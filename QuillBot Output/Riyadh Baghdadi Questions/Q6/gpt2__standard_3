Because floating-point arithmetic is not associative, the order in which the numbers are added in the program might have an impact on the outcome. Accordingly, the sequence in which the numbers are added might affect how the mistakes add up in the end result. Small numbers are added last when adding from left to right, therefore their relative inaccuracy is greater than that of bigger ones. This indicates that adding the tiny numbers first causes the final result to have more mistake. The bigger numbers are added first and have less relative error when adding from right to left. This indicates that when the bigger numbers are added first, the final result has less error. The sequence of the integers counts in this particular program because the series being added is an alternating series with a total of 0. As a consequence, adding from right to left produces a more accurate answer since doing so minimizes the relative inaccuracy imposed by the little numbers.
