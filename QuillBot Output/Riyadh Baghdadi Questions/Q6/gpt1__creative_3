The program's accuracy decreases when additions are performed clockwise rather than counterclockwise. The reason for this is that relative inaccuracy is magnified for smaller numbers since they are added first in left-to-right arithmetic. It is more accurate to add from right to left, since bigger numbers are added first. When performing arithmetic operations on a series of integers, the accumulation of numerical mistakes relies on the order in which the operations are performed. It's because floating-point arithmetic isn't associative. Accordingly, the sum might be affected by the sequence in which the additions are performed. The total of the series is log(2), the series is alternating harmonic, and the order of the integers is significant in the program. The relative inaccuracy is reduced and the accuracy of the final result is improved if the biggest numbers are added first and the smallest numbers are added last.
