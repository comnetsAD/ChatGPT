Pure strategy No player can enhance their payout by altering their strategy while the other players' tactics stay fixed in Nash equilibrium. Mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a collection of probability distributions across strategies where no actor can increase their anticipated return by modifying their probability distribution while the others' stay fixed. This game lacks pure strategy Nash equilibria. The mixed strategy Nash equilibrium requires finding probability distributions for each player such that no player may enhance their anticipated reward by altering their distribution. E(L) = 2 * P(D, L) + 3 * P(R) for player U. (D, R) 2 * P(D, L) + 5 * P(R) (D, R) U should play R because E(R) > E. (L) Playing L and R for player D yields: E(L) = 1 * P(U, L) + 4 * P (U, R) E(R) = 1 * P(U, L) + 2 * P (U, R) D should play L as E(L) > E. (R) U and D's mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (1,1). U plays R with probability 1 and D plays L with probability 1. Alternatively, for every mixed strategy of D other than playing L with probability 1, U will always have a greater anticipated payout by playing R and D will always have a higher expected payoff by playing L. This game has one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.
