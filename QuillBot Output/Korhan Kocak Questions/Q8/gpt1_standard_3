A simple tactic In a Nash equilibrium, no player can increase their payout by altering their strategy while the other players' tactics stay the same. mixed tactics In a Nash equilibrium, no player can increase their anticipated payout by altering their probability distribution while the probability distributions of the other players stay constant. There are no Nash equilibria using pure strategy for this game. Finding the probability distributions for each player such that no player may increase their anticipated payout by modifying their distribution is necessary to determine the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. The predicted rewards for playing L and R for player U are as follows: E(L) = 2 * P(D, L) + 3 * P (D, R) E(R) = P(D, L) * 2 * P + P * 5 (D, R) The optimal move for Player U to make is to play R since E(R) > E. (L) The anticipated benefits for playing L and R for player D are: E(L) = P(U, L) * 1 * P + 4 * P (U, R) E(R) = P(U, L) * 1 * P + 2 * P (U, R) The optimal move for Player D to make is to play L since E(L) > E. (R) Therefore, for U and D, respectively, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is (1,1). Accordingly, player U will play R with a probability of 1, and player D will play L with a probability of 1. A different observation is that for every mixed strategy of D other than playing L with probability 1, U will always have a greater anticipated reward by playing R, and for any mixed strategy of D other than playing L with probability 1, D will always have a higher expected payoff by playing L. There is just one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium in this game.
