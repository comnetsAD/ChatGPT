A straightforward method Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies in which no player's payout can be improved by altering their strategy while the other players' strategies stay constant. A hybrid approach Nash equilibrium is a collection of probability distributions across strategies in which no player can increase their anticipated reward by modifying their probability distribution while the probability distributions of the other players stay constant. There are no pure strategy Nash equilibria in this game. To determine the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we must first identify the probability distributions for each player such that no player's anticipated reward can be improved by altering their distribution. The anticipated payoffs for playing L and R for player U are as follows: E(L) = 2 * P(D, L) + 3 * P (D, R) 2 * P(D, L) + 5 * P = E(R) (D, R) Because E(R) > E, Player U's optimal answer is to play R. (L) The estimated payoffs for playing L and R for player D are as follows: 1 * P(U, L) + 4 * P = E(L) (U, R) 1 * P(U, L) + 2 * P = E(R) (U, R) Because E(L) > E, Player D's optimal answer is to play L. (R) As a result, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is (1,1) for U and D. This indicates that player U plays R with a probability of one and player D plays L with a probability of one. Alternatively, we can see that for every D mixed strategy other than playing L with probability 1, U will always have a greater anticipated reward by playing R and D will always have a higher expected payoff by playing L. There is just one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium in this game.
