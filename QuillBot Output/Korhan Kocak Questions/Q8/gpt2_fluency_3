A straightforward method Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one for each player, in which no person's reward can be improved by unilaterally switching to a different strategy while the other players' strategies remain constant. A hybrid approach Nash equilibrium is a collection of probability distributions across strategies, one for each player, such that no player can increase their anticipated reward by switching to a different probability distribution while the other players' probability distributions remain unaltered. To establish the pure strategy Nash equilibrium, we must first determine whether there is any strategy for each player such that no player can enhance their reward by altering their strategy while the other player's strategy remains unaltered. We have two players in this case: player 1 (row player) and player 2. (column player). Player 1 obtains the greatest reward (3) regardless of player 2's strategy if he picks strategy U. As a result, player 1 will not alter his approach from U. Player 2 earns the greatest reward (5) regardless of player 1's strategy if he picks strategy R. As a result, player 2 will not alter his approach from R. As a result, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (U, R), with player 1 selecting strategy U and player 2 selecting strategy R. To find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we must first determine whether there is any probability distribution over strategies for each player such that no player can improve their expected payoff by changing their probability distribution while the other player's probability distribution remains constant. We have two players in this case: player 1 (row player) and player 2. (column player). Player 1's anticipated payout is p(2)+(1-p)(1)=1+p if he plays strategy U with probability p and strategy D with probability (1-p). Player 2's anticipated payout is q(2)+(1-q)(5)=5-3q if he plays strategy L with probability q and strategy R with probability (1-q). We may use these predicted payoffs to determine each player's optimum reaction to the other's mixed approach. If p(2)+(1-p)(1)>p(1)+(1-p)(1), player 1 chooses approach U over strategy D. (4) This suggests that if p>1/3 for player 2, he chooses strategy L over R if q(2)+(1-q)(5)>q(1)+(1-q)(2) As a result, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (p,q) = (1/3, 1/3), with player 1 playing strategy U with a probability of 1/3 and strategy D with a probability of 2/3, and player 2 playing strategy L with a probability of 1/3 and strategy R with a probability of 2/3. As a result, there is one pure strategy Nash equilibrium (U, R) and one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (p,q) = (1/3, 1/3) in the game.
