A pure strategy A collection of strategies is said to be in a state of Nash equilibrium when no player can increase their payout by altering their strategy while the strategies of the other players stay unchanged. A tactic consisting of both The Nash equilibrium is a collection of probability distributions across strategies in which no player can increase their anticipated reward by modifying their own probability distribution while the probability distributions of the other players stay unchanged. There are no Nash equilibria that can be reached using a purely strategic approach in this game. In order to determine the Nash equilibrium for mixed strategies, we need to find the probability distributions for each player in such a way that it is impossible for any player to enhance their anticipated reward by altering their distribution. The following formula may be used to calculate the anticipated payoffs for player U while playing L and R: E(L) = 2 * P(D, L) + 3 * P (D, R) E(R) = 2 * P(D, L) + 5 * P (D, R) The optimum move for Player U to make is to play R, given that E(R) is better than E. (L) Payoffs that may be anticipated for player D's actions in L and R are as follows: E(L) = 1 * P(U, L) + 4 * P (U, R) E(R) = 1 * P(U, L) + 2 * P (U, R) The optimal move for Player D to make is to play L since E(L) is better than E. (R) The mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is thus (1,1) for both U and D correspondingly. This indicates that player U has a one in one chance of playing R, whereas player D has a one in one chance of playing L. Alternately, we can also make the observation that for any mixed strategy of D other than playing L with probability 1, U will always have a higher expected payoff by playing R, and for any mixed strategy of U other than playing R with probability 1, D will always have a higher expected payoff by playing L. This observation holds true for any mixed strategy of D other than playing L with probability 1, but it does not hold true for any mixed strategy of U other than playing R with probability 1. There is just one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium that can be reached in this game.
