A simple tactic A set of tactics known as a Nash equilibrium is one where no player may increase their payout by unilaterally adopting a new strategy while the other players maintain their current strategies. mixed tactics A collection of probability distributions across strategies known as a Nash equilibrium exists when no player can increase their anticipated reward by unilaterally switching to a different probability distribution while the probability distributions of the other players remain the same. If there is a strategy for each player such that no player can increase their payout by altering their approach while the other player maintains their strategy, then we have found the pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Two players are present here: player 1 (row player) and player 2. (column player). In spite of player 2's plan, player 1 receives the greatest reward (3) if he choose strategy U. Therefore, player 1 won't alter his U-style tactics. Player 2 receives the largest reward (5) if he choose strategy R, regardless of player 1's choice. Therefore, player 2 won't depart from R's approach. Since player 1 picks strategy U and player 2 chooses strategy R, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (U, R). The probability distribution across strategies for each player must be such that neither player may increase their anticipated reward by altering their probability distribution while the other player maintains their probability distribution constant in order to reach the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Two players are present here: player 1 (row player) and player 2. (column player). Player 1's anticipated payout is p(2)+(1-p)(1)=1+p if he plays strategy U with probability p and strategy D with probability (1-p). Player 2's anticipated payout is q(2)+(1-q)(5)=5-3q if he plays strategy L with probability q and strategy R with probability (1-q), respectively. These anticipated rewards may be used to determine how one player should react to the other's mixed approach. If p(2)+(1-p)(1)>p(1)+(1-p)(1), player 1 chooses strategy U over D. (4) In other words, if p>1/3 for player 2, he favors strategy L over R. Similarly, if q(2)+(1-q)(5)>q(1)+(1-q)(2), he chooses strategy L over R. The mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is thus (p,q) = (1/3, 1/3), where player 1 plays strategy U with probability 1/3 and strategy D with probability 2/3 and player 2 plays strategy L with probability 1/3 and strategy R with probability 2/3. As a result, the game has one Nash equilibrium for pure strategies (U, R) and one for mixed strategies (p,q) = (1/3, 1/3).
