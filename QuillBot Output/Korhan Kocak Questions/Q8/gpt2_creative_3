Direct tactic The Nash equilibrium is the set of all possible strategies where no player can maximize their payout by changing their approach while the other players maintain theirs. Combining approaches In a Nash equilibrium, all participants have distinct probability distributions across their tactics, and no one can increase their anticipated return by changing their own probability distribution while the others maintain theirs. If neither party can enhance their payout by altering their approach while the other player maintains their strategy intact, then the game is in a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Players 1 (the row player) and 2 (the other player) are seen here (column player). If Player 1 uses Strategy U, he will always get the maximum payout (3), regardless of what Player 2 does. Player 1 will thus continue to use the U tactic. No of what player 1 does, player 2 will always get the best outcome (5) if he follows strategy R. Player 2 will continue to use the tactic R. Therefore, (U, R) is the Nash equilibrium for a game with just two strategies, with player 1 choosing U and player 2 choosing R. To identify the Nash equilibrium for a game with mixed strategies, we must first determine whether or not each player's probability distribution across their tactics can be altered without affecting the other player's anticipated payout. Players 1 (the row player) and 2 (the other player) are seen here (column player). A player's anticipated return is p(2)+(1-p)(1)=1+p if he chooses strategy U with probability p and strategy D with probability (1-p). The anticipated return for player 2 is q(2)+(1-q)(5)=5-3q if he chooses strategy L with probability q and strategy R with probability (1-q). Using these predicted returns, we may determine the optimal countermeasure for each player against the opponent's hybrid approach. Whenever (p(2)+(1-p)(1))>(p(1)+(1-p)(1)), player 1 chooses (U) over (D) (4) If player 2 has a probability greater than one-third, then he will choose strategy L over R if the values of q(2)+(1-q)(5)>q(1)+(1-q)(2). Since player 1 uses strategy U with a probability of 2/3 and strategy D with a probability of 2/3, and player 2 uses strategy L with a probability of 1/3 and strategy R with a probability of 2/3, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (p,q) = (1/3, 1/3). There are two Nash equilibria in this game, one for each possible combination of strategies: (U, R) and (p, q) = (1/3, 1/3).
