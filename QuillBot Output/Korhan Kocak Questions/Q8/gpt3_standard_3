A simple tactic When two players are in a Nash equilibrium, neither has a reason to alter their approach in light of the other's tactics. mixed tactics A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies where neither player has a reason to alter their approach in light of the other player's approach. We check each player's strategy to see if it is the optimum response to the other player's plan in order to locate the pure strategy Nash equilibria. The optimum move for player 1 in response to player 2's plan L is to play U because it offers a better reward than choosing D. They should play U as their best reaction to player 2's tactic R. Since player 1 plays U and player 2 plays L or R, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (U, L) and (U, R), respectively. The optimum move for player 2 in response to player 1's strategy U is to play R because it offers a greater reward than playing L. Similar to how they should play R in response to player 1's plan D. Consequently, the (U, R) and (D, R) pure strategy Nash equilibriums are reached when player 1 plays U or D and player 2 plays R. We must examine each player's expected payoffs in light of the mixed strategy of the other player in order to identify the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Let x represent the likelihood that player 1 will play U and y represent the likelihood that player 2 will play L. Then, player 1's anticipated gain is equal to 2x + 1(1-x), while player 2's anticipated gain is equal to 3y + 2. (1-y). Player 1 needs to have 2x + 1(1-x) = 1(1-x) + 4x, which can be expressed more simply as x = 2/5, in order to be equally likely to play U or D. Let z represent the likelihood that player 2 will choose to play R. In this case, player 1's anticipated reward is 2x + 1(1-x) = 2(2/5) + 1(3/5) = 8/5, while player 2's anticipated reward is 5z + 2(1-z) = 5z + 2(1-z) = 2z + 2. Player 2 must have 5z + 2(1-z) = 3y + 2(1-y) = 3(2/5) + 2(3/5) = 8/5, which is equivalent to z = 2/5, in order to be neutral regarding playing R or L. Since player 1 plays U with probability 2/5, player 2 plays L with probability 2/5, and player 3 plays R with probability 2/5, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (x, y, z) = (2/5, 2/5, 2/5).
