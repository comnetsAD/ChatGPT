A straightforward strategy Nash equilibrium is a strategy in which neither player has an incentive to change their strategy in light of the other player's strategy. A hybrid strategy Nash equilibrium is a combination of strategies in which neither player has an incentive to change their strategy in light of the other player's strategy. To find the pure strategy Nash equilibria, we examine each strategy for each player to see if it is the best response to the strategy of the other player. Player 1's best response to player 2's strategy L is to play U, which has a higher payoff than playing D. Similarly, in response to player 2's strategy R, they should play U. As a result, the Nash equilibrium for pure strategy is (U, L) and (U, R), where player 1 plays U and player 2 plays L or R. Player 2's best response to player 1's strategy U is to play R, which has a higher payoff than playing L. Similarly, in response to player 1's strategy D, they should play R. As a result, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (U, R) and (D, R), with player one playing U or D and player two playing R. To find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we must examine the expected payoffs for each player given the mixed strategy of the other player. Let x represent the probability that player 1 will play U and y represent the probability that player 2 will play L. Then player 1's expected payoff is 2x + 1(1-x), and player 2's expected payoff is 3y + 2. (1-y). To have player 1 choose between playing U and D, we need 2x + 1(1-x) = 1(1-x) + 4x, which simplifies to x = 2/5. Let z be the probability that player 2 will play R. Then, for player 1, the expected payoff is 2x + 1(1-x) = 2(2/5) + 1(3/5) = 8/5, and for player 2, the expected payoff is 5z + 2(1-z) = 5z + 2(1-z) = 2z + 2. To have player 2 choose between playing R and L, we need 5z + 2(1-z) = 3y + 2(1-y) = 3(2/5) + 2(3/5) = 8/5, which simplifies to z = 2/5. As a result, the Nash equilibrium for a mixed strategy is (x, y, z) = (2/5, 2/5, 2/5), where player 1 plays U with probability 2/5, player 2 plays L with probability 2/5, and player 3 plays R with probability 2/5.
