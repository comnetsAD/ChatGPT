A pure strategy The Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally switching to a different strategy while the other players keep their strategies unchanged. This is because the Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, not a single strategy. A tactic consisting of both The Nash equilibrium is a set of probability distributions over strategies, one for each player, in which no player can improve their expected payoff by unilaterally switching to a different probability distribution while the other players keep their probability distributions unchanged. In other words, no player can improve their expected payoff by changing their probability distribution while the other players keep their probability distributions the same. In order to locate the Nash equilibrium based on pure strategy, we need to determine whether or not there is any strategy for each player such that no player can improve their payoff by changing their strategy while the other player keeps their strategy unchanged. If there is such a strategy, then the Nash equilibrium will be found. Two players are present in this scenario: player 1 (the row player) and player 2. (column player). If player 1 goes with strategy U, regardless of what player 2 does, player 1 will get the greatest possible payout of three points. Therefore, player 1 will not alter his current approach, which is U. If player 2 goes with strategy R, regardless of what player 1 does, player 2 will always obtain the largest reward possible, which is five. Therefore, player 2 will continue to play using the tactic R. Because of this, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (U, R), in which player 1 picks strategy U and player 2 chooses strategy R. In order to locate the Nash equilibrium for mixed strategies, we need to determine whether or not there is any probability distribution over strategies for each player such that no player can improve their expected payoff by altering their probability distribution while the other player maintains their probability distribution in its current state. If there is such a distribution, then the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium must exist. Two players are present in this scenario: player 1 (the row player) and player 2. (column player). If player 1 chooses strategy U with a probability of p and chooses strategy D with a probability of (1-p), then player 1's anticipated payout is p(2) plus (1-p)(1), which equals 1+p. If player 2 uses strategy L with a probability of q and strategy R with a probability of (1-q), then his anticipated payout is q(2)+(1-q)(5), which is 5-3q. We may utilize these projected payoffs to determine the most effective reaction that each player should have to the mixed strategy used by the other player. If p(2)+(1-p)(1) is greater than p(1)+(1-p), then player 1 should choose strategy U rather than D. (4) if q(2)+(1-q)(5)>q(1)+(1-q)(2), then player 2 opts for the L strategy rather than the R approach. if q>1/3, then player 2 chooses the L strategy. Accordingly, the Nash equilibrium for mixed strategies is (p,q) = (1/3, 1/3), in which player 1 plays strategy U with a probability of 1/3 and strategy D with a probability of 2/3, and player 2 plays strategy L with a probability of 1/3 and strategy R with a probability of 2/3. Therefore, there is one Nash equilibrium based on a pure strategy (U, R) and one Nash equilibrium based on a mixed strategy (p,q) = (1/3, 1/3) in this game.
