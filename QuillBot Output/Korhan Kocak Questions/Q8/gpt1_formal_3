A pure strategy The Nash equilibrium is a collection of tactics in which no player may increase their payout by altering their strategy while the other players' strategies stay unchanged. A mixed approach Nash equilibrium is a collection of probability distributions across strategies in which no player may increase their anticipated reward by altering their probability distribution while the probability distributions of the other players stay unchanged. There are no pure strategy Nash equilibria for this game. To determine the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we must determine the probability distributions for each player such that no player may enhance their anticipated return by altering their probability distribution. The anticipated payoffs for playing L and R for player U are as follows: E(L) = 2 * P(D, L) + 3 * P (D, R) E(R) = 2 * P(D, L) + 5 * P (D, R) Player U should respond with R since E(R) is superior than E. (L) The predicted payoffs for player D for playing L and R are: E(L) = 1 * P(U, L) + 4 * P (U, R) E(R) = 1 * P(U, L) + 2 * P (U, R) Player D should respond with L since E(L) > E. (R) Therefore, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is (1,1) for both U and D. This indicates that player U plays R with a 1 percent chance and player D plays L with a 1 percent chance. For every mixed strategy of D other than playing L with probability 1, U will always have a greater anticipated reward by playing R, and for any mixed strategy of U other than playing R with probability 1, D will always have a higher expected payoff by playing L. There is just one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium in this game.
