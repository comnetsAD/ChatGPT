A pure strategy Nash equilibrium is a strategy in which neither player has an incentive to alter their approach given the opponent's strategy. A mixed approach The Nash equilibrium is a combination of strategies in which neither player has an incentive to alter their plan in response to the strategy of the other player. To determine the pure strategy Nash equilibria, we examine each player's strategy to determine if it is the optimal response to the other player's plan. The optimal answer for player 1 to player 2's tactic L is to play U, which results in a greater reward than playing D. Likewise, the optimal response to player 2's approach R is U. The pure strategy Nash equilibrium is therefore (U, L) and (U, R), where player 1 plays U and player 2 either L or R. The optimal answer for player 2 to player 1's tactic U is to play R, as it yields a greater return than playing L. Likewise, the optimal answer to player 1's approach D is R. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium for pure strategies is (U, R) and (D, R), where player 1 plays U or D and player 2 plays R. To determine the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we must examine the expected payoffs for each player given the mixed strategy of the other player. Let x represent the likelihood that player 1 will play U and y represent the likelihood that player 2 will play L. Then, the expected return for player 1 is 2x + 1(1-x), while the expected return for player 2 is 3y + 2. (1-y). 2x + 1(1-x) = 1(1-x) + 4x, which simplifies to x = 2/5, is required for player 1 to be indifferent between playing U and D. Similarly, let z be the likelihood that player 2 will play R. The projected payouts for players 1 and 2 are 2x + 1(1-x) = 2(2/5) + 1(3/5) = 8/5 and 5z + 2(1-z) = 5z + 2(1-z) = 2z + 2, respectively. 5z + 2(1-z) = 3y + 2(1-y) = 3(2/5) + 2(3/5) = 8/5, which reduces to z = 2/5. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium for mixed strategies is (x, y, z) = (2/5, 2/5, 2/5) where player 1 plays U with a probability of 2/5, player 2 plays L with a probability of 2/5, and player 3 plays R with a probability of 2/5.
