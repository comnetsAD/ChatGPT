Direct tactic If all participants stick to their original tactics, then the Nash equilibrium is the set of strategies that results in the best possible payout for everyone. Combining approaches To achieve Nash equilibrium, all players' probability distributions over their tactics must be identical, meaning that no one may increase their anticipated return by altering their own probability distribution while maintaining the other players' probability distributions. There are no Nash equilibria for this game that include just optimal strategies. In order to determine the Nash equilibrium for a game involving more than one player using a mixed strategy, we must first determine the probability distributions for each player so that no player may enhance their anticipated reward by altering their distribution. U may calculate his projected earnings from playing L and R as follows: E(L) = 2 * P(D, L) + 3 * P (D, R) The formula for E(R) is 2 * P(D, L) + 5 * P (D, R) Since E(R) > E, player U should respond with R. (L) The projected returns for L and R for player D are as follows: The formula for the energy dissipation along a long line is: E(L) = 1 * P(U, L) (U, R) The formula for E(R) is: 1*P(U, L)+2*P (U, R) D should respond with L, as E(L) > E. (R) As a result, the (1,1) Nash equilibrium for U and D in this game is the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. This suggests that there is a one in one chance that player U will play R and that player D will play L. Alternatively, we can see that the anticipated reward for player D is always highest when playing L with probability 1, and the expected payoff for player U is always highest when playing R with probability 1. There is only one mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium in this game.
