A pure strategy A strategy is said to be in Nash equilibrium when neither player has an incentive to change their approach given the strategy that the other player is using. A mixed strategy The combination of strategies known as a Nash equilibrium is one in which neither player has an incentive to change their strategy in light of the strategy employed by the other player. In order to locate the pure strategy Nash equilibria, we examine each player's strategy to see whether or not it provides the optimal response to the strategy employed by the other player. Playing U, rather than D, is the optimum move for player 1 to make in response to player 2's strategy L because playing U results in a bigger reward than playing D. In the same vein, the most effective way for them to react to player 2's tactic R is to play U. The pure strategy Nash equilibrium is therefore (U, L) and (U, R), where player 1 plays U and player 2 plays L or R respectively. Playing R, rather than L, is the optimal response for player 2 to take to player 1's strategy U since playing R results in a greater payout than playing L does. In the same vein, the most effective way for them to react to player 1's plan D is to play R. The pure strategy Nash equilibrium is therefore either (U, R) or (D, R), where player 1 plays U or D and player 2 plays R. Checking the predicted payoffs for each player given the mixed strategy of the other player is a necessary step in the process of locating the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Let's say that x represents the likelihood that player 1 will play U and y is the likelihood that player 2 will play L. The expected payoff for player 1 is therefore calculated as 2x plus 1(1-x), while the expected payment for player 2 is calculated as 3y plus 2. (1-y). To ensure that player 1 does not care whether they play U or D, we need to have 2x + 1(1-x) = 1(1-x) + 4x, which can be rewritten as x = 2/5. This allows player 1 to be neutral about the role they take. In the same vein, we will refer to z as the likelihood that player 2 will play R. The expected return for player 1 is calculated as follows: 2x + 1(1-x) = 2(2/5) + 1(3/5) = 8/5, whereas the expected return for player 2 is calculated as follows: 5z + 2(1-z) = 5z + 2(1-z) = 5z + 2(1-z) = 2z + 2. In order for player 2 to be neutral about whether they play R or L, we need to have 5z + 2(1-z) = 3y + 2(1-y) = 3(2/5) + 2(3/5) = 8/5, which can be rewritten as z = 2/5. As a result, the Nash equilibrium for mixed strategies is represented by the equation (x, y, z) = (2/5, 2/5, 2/5) in which player 1 plays U with a probability of 2/5, player 2 plays L with a probability of 2/5, and player 3 plays R with a probability of 2/5.
