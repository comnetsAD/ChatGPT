Pure strategy Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one for each player, where no player can increase their reward by unilaterally switching strategies while the others retain theirs. Mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a collection of probability distributions across strategies, one for each player, such that no player can increase their anticipated reward by unilaterally switching to a different probability distribution while the other players retain theirs. To identify the pure strategy Nash equilibrium, we must develop a strategy for each player such that neither person can enhance their payout by changing their strategy while the other player retains theirs. Player 1 (row player) and player 2 are here (column player). Strategy U gives player 1 the greatest reward (3) independent of player 2. Player 1 will keep his U approach. Strategy R gives player 2 the greatest reward (5) regardless of player 1's strategy. Player 2 will stick to R. Thus, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (U, R) where player 1 selects U and player 2 chooses R. To identify the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we must construct a probability distribution across strategies for each player such that neither player can enhance their anticipated return by altering their probability distribution while the other player maintains theirs constant. Player 1 (row player) and player 2 are here (column player). If player 1 plays strategy U with probability p and strategy D with probability (1-p), his anticipated payout is p(2)+(1-p)(1)=1+p. If player 2 plays strategy L with probability q and strategy R with probability (1-q), his anticipated payout is q(2)+(1-q)(5)=5-3q. These predicted payoffs help us determine each player's optimum reaction to the other's mixed approach. If p(2)+(1-p)(1)>p(1)+(1-p), player 1 favors U over D. (4) Player 2 favours strategy L over R if q(2)+(1-q)(5)>q(1)+(1-q)(2). Thus, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (p,q) = (1/3, 1/3) where player 1 plays strategy U with probability 1/3 and strategy D with probability 2/3, and player 2 plays strategy L with 1/3 and strategy R with 2/3. The game features one pure strategy Nash equilibrium (U, R) and one mixed strategy one (p,q) = (1/3, 1/3).
