Unadulterated tactic When both players are at a Nash equilibrium, they have no reason to alter their play based on what the other player is doing. With a hybrid approach The Nash equilibrium occurs when both players' strategies are independent of the other's and there is no reason for one to change. Finding the pure strategy Nash equilibria requires testing each player's plan against the other players' to see which is the optimum answer. In response to player 2's strategy L, player 1 should play U rather than D because U yields a bigger payout. They would do well to counter Player 2's plan R with U. Accordingly, (U, L), and (U, R) are the two possible solutions to the pure strategy Nash equilibrium, whereby player 1 uses strategy (U) and player 2 uses either strategy (L) or strategy (R). It is optimal for player 2 to counter player 1's tactic U with a play of R, rather than L, due to the greater return that comes from playing R. To the same extent, the best response they can give to Player 1's strategy D is also Player 1's strategy R. As a result, (U, R) and (D, R) are the two possible configurations of the pure strategy Nash equilibrium, with player 1 using U or D and player 2 using R, respectively. Checking predicted payoffs for each player given the other player's mixed strategy leads us to the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Consider the following two scenarios: in the first, player 1 plays U, and in the second, player 2 plays L. Then, Player 2 can anticipate receiving 3y + 2 whereas Player 1 will receive 2x + 1(1-x) (1-y). If player 1 is neutral between playing U and D, then we get 2x + 1(1-x) = 1(1-x) + 4x, where x is any positive integer between 2 and 5, where x is the smallest positive integer. Let z represent the chance that player 2 will use R. Then, Player 2 can anticipate receiving a return of 5z + 2(1-z) = 5z + 2(1-z) = 2z + 2, whereas Player 1 can anticipate receiving a return of 2x + 1(1-x) = 2(2/5) + 1(3/5) = 8/5. We need 5z + 2(1-z) = 3y + 2(1-y) = 3(2/5) + 2(3/5) = 8/5 for player 2 to be neutral between playing R and L, which simplifies to z = 2/5. If both players have a 2/5 chance of playing U and a 2/5 chance of playing L and a 2/5 chance of playing R, then the resulting (x, y, z) = (2/5, 2/5, 2/5) is the Nash equilibrium for a mixed strategy.
