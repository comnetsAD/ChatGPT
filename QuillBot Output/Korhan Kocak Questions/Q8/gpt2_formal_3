A pure strategy The Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one for each player, in which no person may increase their payout by unilaterally switching to a new strategy while the other players maintain their current strategies. A mixed approach The Nash equilibrium is a collection of probability distributions across strategies, one for each player, such that no player can increase their anticipated reward by unilaterally switching to a different probability distribution while the other players maintain their current probability distributions. To determine the pure strategy Nash equilibrium, we must determine if there exists a strategy for each player such that no player can enhance their reward by altering their strategy while the other player maintains their approach. Two players are present: player 1 (row player) and player 2 (column player). Player 1 receives the highest payout (3) regardless of player 2's strategy if he picks strategy U. So, player 1 will maintain his U tactic. Regardless of player 1's approach, player 2 will get the greatest payout (5) if he picks strategy R. Therefore, player 2 will not alter his tactic of R. Thus, the Nash equilibrium for pure strategies is (U, R), where player 1 picks strategy U and player 2 chooses strategy R. To determine the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we must determine whether there exists a probability distribution over each player's strategies such that no player can improve their expected payoff by altering their probability distribution while the other player maintains their probability distribution. Two players are present: player 1 (row player) and player 2 (column player). If player 1 chooses strategy U with probability p and strategy D with probability (1-p), his anticipated return is p(2)+(1-p)(1) = 1+p. If player 2 chooses strategy L with probability q and strategy R with probability (1-q), his anticipated return is q(2) + (1-q) (5) = 5-3q. These predicted payoffs may be used to determine the optimal reaction of each player to the other's mixed strategy. Whenever p(2)+(1-p)(1)>p(1)+(1-p)(1), player 1 chooses strategy U over D. (4) Player 2 favors strategy L over R if q(2)+(1-q)(5)>q(1)+(1-q)(2) if p>1/3 and q(2)+(1-q)(5)>q(1)+(1-q)(2). Player 1 chooses strategy U with a probability of 1/3 and strategy D with a probability of 2/3, while Player 2 chooses strategy L with a probability of 1/3 and strategy R with a probability of 2/3. Thus, the game has one Nash equilibrium for pure strategy (U, R) and one for mixed strategy (p,q) = (1/3, 1/3).
