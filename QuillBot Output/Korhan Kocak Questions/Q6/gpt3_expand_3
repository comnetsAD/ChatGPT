Pure strategy Given the opponent player's approach, a Nash equilibrium strategy has no motivation to alter. Mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a strategy combination where neither player has an incentive to change given the other player's plan. We check each player's strategy to determine the pure strategy Nash equilibria. Player 1's best reaction to player 2's plan L is U, which pays more than D. They should play U to counter player 2's R. Thus, player 1 plays U while player 2 plays L or R in the pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Player 2's best reaction to player 1's plan U is R, which pays more than L. They should play R to counter player 1's D. Thus, player 1 plays U or D while player 2 plays R in the pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Checking each player's predicted payoffs given the other player's mixed strategy will identify the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Player 1 plays U and player 2 plays L. Player 1's projected payment is 2x + 1(1-x) while player 2's is 3y + 2. (1-y). Player 1 must be indifferent between U and D if 2x + 1(1-x) = 1(1-x) + 4x, which reduces to x = 2/5. Player 2 plays R with probability z. Then player 1's expected reward is 2x + 1(1-x) = 2(2/5) + 1(3/5) = 8/5 while player 2's is 5z + 2(1-z) = 2z + 2. Player 2 must be indifferent between R and L if 5z + 2(1-z) = 3y + 2(1-y) = 3(2/5) + 2(3/5) = 8/5, which reduces to z = 2/5. Thus, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (x, y, z) = (2/5, 2/5, 2/5) where player 1 plays U with probability 2/5, player 2 plays L, and player 3 plays R.
