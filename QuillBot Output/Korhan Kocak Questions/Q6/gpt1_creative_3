Using a purely strategic approach in a vNM-preference game To achieve Nash equilibrium, both players must adopt the same strategy, and no one can increase their payout by switching tactics while the other player maintains theirs. Combining approaches The Nash equilibrium occurs when both players maintain their current tactics and there is no way for either player to increase their anticipated return by switching strategies. Each player's dominant strategy may be used to determine whether the pure strategy Nash equilibria exist, since this approach will always result in a larger payout for that player than any other strategy, independent of the other player's strategy. There is no clear winner between U and D for player 1. There is no clear winner between L and R for player 2. As a result, the game lacks a unique Nash equilibrium based on a purely strategic play. Checking if each player has no reason to depart from their mixed strategy in light of the other player's mixed plan allows us to identify the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Assume that in turn 1, player 1 plays U with probability p and D with probability 1-p, and that in turn 2, player 2 plays L with probability q and R with probability 1-q. Expected reward for Player 1 is p(2) + (1-p)(6), whereas for Player 2 it is q(2) + (1-q)(6) (4). To counter move U, player 1 should play with a probability p = (4-6q)/(8-4q), whereas player 2 should play L with a probability q = (2-2p)/(8-4q) (8-4p) Since both players have an equal chance of making the moves U and D, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is (p,q) = (1/4,1/4). In conclusion, the game does not have a pure strategy Nash equilibrium, but there is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (1/4,1/4) where both players alternate between the two strategies equally often.
