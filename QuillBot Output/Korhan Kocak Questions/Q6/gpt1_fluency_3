A pure strategy in a game with vNM preferences Nash equilibrium is a pair of strategies (one for each player) in which neither person can increase their payout by altering their strategy while the other player does not. A hybrid approach Nash equilibrium is a pair of probability distributions across strategies in which neither player can enhance their anticipated reward by altering their strategy while the other player does not. To determine the pure strategy Nash equilibria, we may ask each player whether they have a dominating strategy, which is a strategy that always offers them a better payout than any other strategy, independent of the strategy of the other player. Neither U nor D is a dominating tactic for player 1. Neither L nor R is a dominating tactic for player 2. As a result, no pure strategy Nash equilibrium exists for this game. To determine the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we may examine whether there is no incentive for either player to stray from their mixed strategy given the mixed strategy of the other player. Assume that player 1 plays U with a probability of p and D with a probability of 1-p, and that player 2 plays L with a probability of q and R with a probability of 1-q. The anticipated payout for player 1 is p(2) + (1-p)(6), whereas the expected payoff for player 2 is q(2) + (1-q)(6) (4). The best answer for player 1 is to play U with probability p = (4-6q)/(8-4q), while the best response for player 2 is to play L with probability q = (2-2p)/(8-4q) (8-4p) As a result, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is (p,q) = (1/4,1/4), where player 1 plays U and D equally and player 2 plays L and R equally. In summary, there is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium for this game, but there is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (1/4,1/4) in which both players play each strategy with a 1/4 probability.
