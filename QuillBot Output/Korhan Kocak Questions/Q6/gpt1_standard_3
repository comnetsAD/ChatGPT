A pure strategy in a game with vNM preferences A pair of strategies known as a Nash equilibrium (one for each player) exist when neither player can increase their payout by altering their approach while the other one remains the same. mixed tactics When two probability distributions across strategies are in a Nash equilibrium, neither player can increase their anticipated return by altering their strategy while the other player sticks with it. We can determine if each player has a dominating strategy—that is, a strategy that always offers them a larger payout than any other strategy, independent of the other player's approach—in order to discover the pure strategy Nash equilibria. Neither U nor D is a dominating tactic for player 1. Neither L nor R is a dominating tactic for player 2. As a result, the game lacks a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. We can determine if there is no incentive for either player to depart from their mixed strategy given the mixed strategy of the other player in order to determine the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Assume that player 1 plays U and D with probabilities of p and 1, whereas player 2 plays L and R with probabilities of q and 1, respectively. The anticipated payment for player 1 is p(2) + (1-p)(6), whereas the expected payout for player 2 is q(2) + (1-q) (4). The best move for player one is to play U, with probability p = (4-6q)/(8-4q), while the best move for player two is to play L, with probability q = (2-2p)/. (8-4p) Since player 1 plays U and D with equal probability and player 2 plays L and R with equal probability, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is (p,q) = (1/4,1/4). In conclusion, there is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (1/4,1/4) where both players play each strategy with a probability of 1/4 but there is not a pure strategy Nash equilibrium for this game.
