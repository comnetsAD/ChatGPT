In a game with vNM preferences, a pure approach is ineffective. The Nash equilibrium is a pair of strategies (one for each player) such that neither person can increase their payout by altering their approach while the other player maintains theirs. A mixed approach The Nash equilibrium is a pair of probability distributions across strategies such that neither player can increase their anticipated reward by altering their approach while the other player maintains their strategy. To determine the pure strategy Nash equilibria, we may examine if each player has a dominating strategy, which is a strategy that always yields a better reward than any other strategy, independent of the other player's strategy. Neither U nor D is a dominating tactic for player 1. Neither L nor R is a dominating tactic for player 2. Therefore, there is no Nash equilibrium for pure strategy in this game. To determine the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we can determine whether neither player has an incentive to depart from their mixed strategy, given the mixed strategy of the other player. Suppose player 1 plays U with a probability of p and D with a probability of -1-p, while player 2 plays L with a probability of q and R with a probability of -1-q. Player 1's projected return is p(2) + (1-p)(6), whereas Player 2's is q(2) + (1-q) (4). Player 1's optimal answer is U with probability p = (4-6q)/(8-4q), whereas Player 2's optimal response is L with probability q = (2-2p)/(8-4q) (8-4p) The mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is thus (p,q) = (1/4,1/4), where player 1 plays U and D with equal probability and player 2 plays L and R with equal probability. In conclusion, there is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium in this game, but there is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (1/4,1/4) in which both players play each strategy with a chance of 1/4.
