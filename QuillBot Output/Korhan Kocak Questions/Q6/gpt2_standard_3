Nash equilibrium is a pair of strategies (one for each player) such that neither player can enhance their payout by altering their approach while the other player retains theirs. Strategy blend Nash equilibrium is a pair of probability distributions across strategies where neither participant can enhance their anticipated payout by altering their approach. To determine the pure strategy Nash equilibria, we may verify each player's dominant strategy, which always offers them a larger payout than any other strategy regardless of the other player's strategy. Player 1's best tactic is neither U nor D. Player 2's best tactic is neither L nor R. Therefore, this game has no pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Given the opposing player's mixed strategy, we may examine whether there is no incentive for either player to depart from their mixed strategy to identify the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Players 1 and 2 play U and D with probabilities p and 1-p, respectively. Player 1's estimated reward is p(2) + (1-p)(6), whereas player 2's is q(2) + (1-q) (4). Player 1's best answer is to play U with probability p = (4-6q)/(8-4q) while player 2's best reaction is to play L with probability q = (2-2p)/(8-4q) (8-4p) Thus, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is (p,q) = (1/4, 1/4), where player 1 plays U and D equally and player 2 plays L and R equally. In conclusion, there is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium for this game, but there is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (1/4, 1/4) when both players play each strategy with 1/4 probability.
