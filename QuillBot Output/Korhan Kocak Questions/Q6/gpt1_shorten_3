Pure strategy wins in vNM games. Nash equilibrium is a pair of strategies (one for each player) where no player can increase their payout by altering their approach while the other player retains theirs. Mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a pair of probability distributions across strategies where neither player can enhance their anticipated return by altering their strategy while the other player retains theirs. To discover pure strategy Nash equilibria, we may verify each player's dominant strategy, which always offers them a greater payout regardless of the other player's approach. Player 1 has no clear plan. Player 2 has no winning plan. This game has no pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Checking if there is no incentive for either player to depart from their mixed strategy given the other player's mixed strategy will discover the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Player 1 plays U with probability p and D with 1-p, while player 2 plays L with probability q and R with 1-q. Player 1's estimated payment is p(2) + (1-p)(6) and player 2's q(2) + (1-q)(6) (4). Player 1's best answer is U with probability p = (4-6q)/(8-4q), whereas player 2's best response is L with probability q = (2-2p)/(8-4q) (8-4p) Thus, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is (p,q) = (1/4,1/4), where player 1 plays U and D equally and player 2 plays L and R equally. This game has a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (1/4, 1/4) where both players play each strategy with 1/4 probability.
