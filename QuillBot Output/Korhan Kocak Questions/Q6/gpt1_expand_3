In a game with vNM preferences, the most effective approach is one that is pure. The Nash equilibrium is a pair of strategies, one for each player, such that neither player can enhance their reward by altering their approach while the other person retains their plan. This is because each player's strategy is independent of the other player's strategy. A tactic consisting of both Nash equilibrium is a pair of probability distributions over strategies such that no player can improve their expected payoff by changing their strategy while the other player keeps their strategy. In other words, no player can improve their expected payoff by changing their strategy while the other player keeps their strategy. The pure strategy Nash equilibria can be found by first determining for each player whether they have a dominant strategy, which is a strategy that always gives them a higher payoff than any other strategy regardless of the strategy used by the other player. This can be done so that the pure strategy Nash equilibria can be found. There is no clear winner for player 1 among the two strategies U and D. There is no clear winner between the L and R strategies for player 2. As a result, there is no equilibrium in this game that can be reached through pure strategy. To determine if there is an incentive for either player to stray from their mixed strategy, given the mixed strategy of the other player, we may examine whether or not there is an incentive for either player to depart from their mixed strategy. Let's assume that player 1 chooses to play U with a probability of p and D with a probability of -1 p, and that player 2 chooses to play L with a probability of q and R with a chance of -1 q. The anticipated payment for player 1 is p(2) plus (1-p)(6), while the expected payout for player 2 is q(2) plus (1-q) (4). The optimal answer for Player 1 is to play U, with the probability p equal to (4-6q)/(8-4q), whereas the optimal response for Player 2 is to play L, with the probability q equal to (2-2p)/(8-4q) (8-4p) As a result, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is (p,q) = (1/4,1/4). This means that player 1 plays U and D with the same amount of probability, and player 2 plays L and R with the same amount of probability. In conclusion, a pure strategy Nash equilibrium does not exist for this game; but, a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (1/4,1/4) does exist, in which both players play each strategy with an equal probability.
