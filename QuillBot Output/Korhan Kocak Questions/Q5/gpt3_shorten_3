Pure strategy wins in vNM games. Nash equilibrium is a pair of strategies (one for each player) where no player can increase their payout by altering their approach while the other player keeps theirs. Mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a pair of probability distributions across strategies where no player can enhance their anticipated return by altering their strategy while the other player keeps theirs. Find the pure strategy Nash equilibria allow us to check each player's dominant strategy, which always yields a better payoff regardless of the other player's plan. Player 1's dominant strategy U pays off 4 regardless of player 2's plan. R dominates for player 2 since it pays more than L regardless of player 1's approach. Player 1 plays U and player 2 plays R in the pure strategy Nash equilibrium (U, R). mixed strategy Given the other player's mixed strategy, we can check whether Nash equilibrium exists. Player 1 plays U with probability p and D with 1-p, while player 2 plays L with probability q and R with 1-q. Player 1's estimated reward is p(4) + (1-p)(7) while player 2's is q(-3) + (1-q) (1). Player 1's best move is U with probability 1 and Player 2's is R with probability 1. This game has no mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. This game has a pure strategy Nash equilibrium (U, R) and no mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.
