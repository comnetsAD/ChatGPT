In a game with vNM preferences, the most effective approach is one that is pure. A tactic consisting of both Nash equilibrium is a pair of probability distributions over strategies such that no player can improve their expected payoff by changing their strategy while the other player keeps their strategy. In other words, no player can improve their expected payoff by changing their strategy while the other player keeps their strategy. In order to discover the original strategy The strategy U is considered to be a dominant strategy for player 1 because it always results in a reward of 4, regardless of what player 2 chooses to do. In order to obtain the optimal balanced strategy Consider the following scenario: player 1 plays U with a probability of p and D with a probability of -1 p, whereas player 2 plays L with a probability of q and R with a probability of -1 q. As a result, the game in question does not have a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.
