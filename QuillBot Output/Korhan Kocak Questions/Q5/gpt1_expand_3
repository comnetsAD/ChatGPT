A pure strategy Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can enhance their result by unilaterally altering their approach while the other players keep theirs constant. This is because each person's strategy is unique to them, and the other players' strategies are fixed. A mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a probability distribution over pure strategies for each player, such that no player can improve their expected outcome by changing their probability distribution while the other players keep theirs fixed. In other words, a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a situation in which no player can improve their expected outcome by changing their probability distribution. Player 1 has access to two unadulterated tactics in this game, namely U and D, whereas Player 2 has access to two unadulterated strategies, namely L and R. First, we are going to look at the Nash equilibrium for the pure strategy. In the event that player 1 selects U, player 2 will choose R in order to get the greatest possible reward of 7. In the event that player 1 picks D, player 2 will choose L in order to get the greatest possible payment of 7. As a result, the Nash equilibria (U, R) and (D, L) are both examples of pure strategy. Now that we have that out of the way, let's talk about the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Player 1 has the ability to assign probability of p and -1 p to the strategies U and D, respectively, while Player 2 has the ability to give probabilities of q and -1 q to the strategies L and R, respectively. The anticipated payout for Player 1's strategy U is 4p plus 7(1-p), whereas the expected payoff for Player 1's approach D is 7p plus 1. (1-p). Therefore, the most appropriate action for player 1 would be to choose strategy U if 4p + 7(1-p) is more than or equal to 7p + 1(1-p), and strategy D in any other circumstance. Which indicates that p is more than or equal to 3/5. In a similar vein, the predicted reward for player 2 when using method L is 4q + 1(1-q), however when using strategy R, it is -3q + 7. (1-q). Because of this, the optimal answer for player 2 is to choose strategy L if the value of 4q plus one (1-q) is greater than the value of -3q plus seven (1-q), and strategy R otherwise. Which indicates that q is greater than or equal to 3/5 As a result, a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is represented by the equation (p, q) = (3/5, 3/5) In conclusion, the game has three possible Nash equilibria: two pure strategy Nash equilibria (U, R) and (D, L) and one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (p, q) = (3/5, 3/5) in which player 1 chooses U with a probability of 3/5 and D with a probability of 2/5, and player 2 chooses L with a probability of 3/5 and R with a probability of 2/5.
