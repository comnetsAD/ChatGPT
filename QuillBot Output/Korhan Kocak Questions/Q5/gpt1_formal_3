A pure strategy The Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can enhance their result by changing their approach unilaterally while the other players maintain theirs. A mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a probability distribution across pure strategies for each player such that no player may enhance their expected result by altering their probability distribution while the other players maintain their fixed probability distributions. Player 1 has two pure tactics U and D in this game, whereas Player 2 has two pure strategies L and R. First, we shall explore the Nash equilibrium for pure strategy. If player 1 selects U, player 2 will choose R in order to get the highest payout of seven. If player 1 selects D, player 2 will choose L to get the maximum possible payout of seven. (U, R) and (D, L) are thus both pure strategy Nash equilibria. Now, we will explore the Nash equilibrium for mixed strategies. Player 1 may give probability p and -1-p to strategies U and D, while player 2 may assign probabilities q and -1-q to strategies L and R. Player 1 has an estimated return of 4p + 7(1-p) from strategy U and 7p + 1 from strategy D. (1-p). Player 1 should choose strategy U if 4p + 7(1-p) >= 7p + 1(1-p), and strategy D otherwise. Consequently p >= 3/5 Similarly, player 2's anticipated payout from strategy L is 4q + 1(1-q), but his expected payoff from strategy R is -3q + 7. (1-q). Consequently, player 2 should choose strategy L if 4q + 1(1-q) >= -3q + 7(1-q) and strategy R otherwise. Consequently q >= 3/5 (p, q) = (3/5, 3/5) is hence a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. The game features two pure strategy Nash equilibria (U, R) and (D, L) and one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (p, q) = (3/5, 3/5) where player 1 picks U with a probability of 3/5 and D with a probability of 2/5, and player 2 chooses L with a probability of 3/5 and R with a probability of 2/5.
