Pure strategy Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one for each participant, where no player can better their result by unilaterally altering their strategy while the others retain theirs. A mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a probability distribution across pure strategies for each player. No player can enhance their anticipated result by altering their probability distribution while the others maintain theirs unchanged. Player 1 has pure tactics U and D, while player 2 has pure strategies L and R. First, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Player 2 will select R for the highest reward of 7 if player 1 chooses U. Player 2 will select L for the greatest reward of 7 if player 1 chooses D. (U, R) and (D, L) are pure strategy Nash equilibria. The mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is next. Player 1 can provide strategy U and D probability p and 1-p, while player 2 can give strategy L and R probabilities q and 1-q. Strategy U pays 4p + 7(1-p) while strategy D pays 7p + 1. (1-p). Player 1 should adopt strategy U if 4p + 7(1-p) >= 7p + 1(1-p) and D otherwise. p > 3/5. Player 2's anticipated payout from strategy L is 4q + 1(1-q), and from strategy R, -3q + 7. (1-q). Player 2 should pick strategy L if 4q + 1(1-q) >= -3q + 7(1-q) and strategy R otherwise. q > 3/5. Thus, (p, q) = (3/5, 3/5), a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. In summary, the game features two pure strategy Nash equilibria (U, R) and (D, L) and one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (p, q) = (3/5, 3/5) where player 1 picks U with probability 3/5 and D with probability 2/5 while player 2 chooses L with probability 3/5 and R with 2/5.
