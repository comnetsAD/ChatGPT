A pure strategy in a game with vNM preferences Nash equilibrium is a pair of strategies (one for each player) in which neither player can improve their payoff by changing their strategy while the other player does not. A hybrid strategy Nash equilibrium is a pair of probability distributions over strategies in which neither player can improve their expected payoff by changing their strategy while the other player does not. To discover the pure strategy Using Nash equilibria, we can determine whether each player has a dominant strategy, which is a strategy that always provides a higher payoff than any other strategy, regardless of the other player's strategy. Strategy U is a dominant strategy for player 1 because it yields a payoff of 4 regardless of player 2's strategy. Player 2's dominant strategy is R because it yields a higher payoff than L regardless of player 1's strategy. As a result, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (U, R), with player one playing U and player two playing R. To locate the mixed strategy Given the other player's mixed strategy, we can test for Nash equilibrium to see if there is no incentive for either player to deviate from their mixed strategy. Assume that player 1 plays U with a probability of p, D with a probability of 1-p, and player 2 plays L with a probability of q and R with a probability of 1-q. The expected payoff for player 1 is p(4) + (1-p)(7), while the expected payoff for player 2 is q(-3) + (1-q) (1). The best response for Player 1 is to play U with probability 1, and the best response for Player 2 is to play R with probability 1. As a result, no mixed strategy Nash equilibrium exists for this game. In conclusion, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is (U, R), and no mixed strategy Nash equilibrium exists.
