A pure strategy in a game with vNM preferences A pair of strategies known as a Nash equilibrium (one for each player) exist when neither player can increase their payout by changing their approach while the other one remains the same. mixed tactics When two probability distributions across strategies are in a Nash equilibrium, no player can increase their expected return by changing their strategy while the other player sticks with it. To choose the best strategy, With the use of Nash equilibria, we may determine if each player has a dominating strategyâ€”that is, a plan that always results in a larger payout for them than any other strategy, independent of the performance of the other player. Because it produces a reward of 4 regardless of the strategy used by player 2, strategy U is a dominant strategy for player 1. In spite of player 1's strategy, player 2's approach R outperforms L in terms of payout. This makes it the player's dominating strategy. Therefore, player 1 plays U, while player 2 plays R, resulting in the pure strategy Nash equilibrium being (U, R). To identify the hybrid approach Given the mixed strategy of the other player, we can test the Nash equilibrium to see if there is no incentive for either player to depart from their mixed strategy. Assume that player 1 plays U with probability p, player 2 plays L with probability q, and player 3 plays R with probability 1-q. The predicted payout for player one is p(4) + (1-p)(7), while the anticipated payout for player two is q(-3) + (1-q) (1). The best move for Player 1 is to play U with probability 1, whereas the best move for Player 2 is to play R with probability 1. As a result, the game's mixed strategy Nash equilibrium does not exist. In conclusion, there is no mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for this game; instead, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (U, R).
