Unadulterated tactic To achieve a Nash equilibrium, all participants must choose the same set of tactics, and no one can gain an advantage by altering their own strategy while the others maintain theirs. The Nash equilibrium for a game with more than two players is a mixed strategy if each player's probability distribution does not improve if the other players maintain their current probability distributions. Both the U and D pure tactics are available to Player 1, whereas both the L and R pure strategies are available to Player 2. To begin, let's think about the Nash equilibrium for a game with just one possible strategy. If player 1 picks U, then player 2 will choose R to maximize his or her 7-point payout. The second player will choose L in the event that the first player selects D, since this will result in a 7 point payout for the second player. Thus, both (U, R) and (D, L) are Nash equilibria with just pure strategies. The Nash equilibrium for a game with several strategies is next up for analysis. Assigning probability p and 1-p to player 1's U and D strategies, and q and 1-q to player 2's L and R strategies, is possible. Player 1 has an estimated return of 4p + 7(1-p) from strategy U, and 7p + 1 from strategy D. (1-p). So, if 4p + 7(1-p) >= 7p + 1(1-p), then strategy U is the optimal answer for player 1, and otherwise, strategy D is the best response. Therefore, p >= 3/5 A similar analysis reveals that the anticipated return for Player 2 using Strategy L is 4q + 1(1-q), whereas Player 2 using Strategy R yields a -3q + 7 loss (1-q). So, if 4q + 1(1-q) >= -3q + 7(1-q), then player 2 should respond with strategy L, and vice versa if the values are the reverse. Therefore, q >= 3/5 As a result, the Nash equilibrium for a game with mixed strategies is (p, q) = (3/5, 3/5). There are three Nash equilibria in this game: one for each possible combination of player actions: (U, R), (D, L), and (p, q) = (3/5, 3/5) (where player 1 chooses U with a probability of 3/5 and D with a probability of 2/5, and player 2 chooses L with a probability of 3/5 and R with a probability of 2/5).
