A straightforward method Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one for each player, in which no player can enhance their result by unilaterally altering their strategy while the other players' remain constant. A mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a probability distribution across pure strategies for each player such that no player can enhance their expected result by modifying their probability distribution while the other players' remains constant. Player 1 has two pure tactics U and D in this game, whereas Player 2 has two pure strategies L and R. First, we'll look at the Nash equilibrium for pure strategies. If player 1 selects U, player 2 will choose R to get the highest reward of 7. If player 1 selects D, player 2 will choose L to get the highest reward of 7. As a result, both (U, R) and (D, L) are pure strategy Nash equilibria. We shall now look at the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Player 1 may give probability p and 1-p to strategies U and D, while Player 2 can assign probabilities q and 1-q to strategies L and R. Player 1's anticipated payout from strategy U is 4p + 7(1-p), and 7p + 1 from strategy D. (1-p). As a result, player 1 should adopt strategy U if 4p + 7(1-p) >= 7p + 1(1-p), and strategy D otherwise. As a result, p >= 3/5. Similarly, the anticipated payoff for strategy L for player 2 is 4q + 1(1-q) and -3q + 7 for strategy R. (1-q). As a result, player 2's optimum reaction is to adopt strategy L if 4q + 1(1-q) >= -3q + 7(1-q), and strategy R otherwise. As a result, q >= 3/5. As a result, (p, q) = (3/5, 3/5) is a Nash mixed strategy equilibrium. In summary, the game has two pure strategy Nash equilibria (U, R) and (D, L) and one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (p, q) = (3/5, 3/5) in which player 1 chooses U with a probability of 3/5 and D with a probability of 2/5 and player 2 chooses L with a probability of 3/5 and R with a probability of 2/5.
