For games when players have vNM preferences, a purely strategic approach is optimal. Nash equilibrium refers to a set of two strategies (one for each player) where neither person can increase their payout by switching strategies while the other player maintains theirs. With a hybrid approach To achieve a Nash equilibrium, both players must maintain their current strategies, so that neither can increase their expected payoff by switching. Identifying the most basic tactic Using Nash equilibria, we may determine whether or not each player has a dominating strategy, in which their expected payout is larger than that of any other strategy, regardless of the other player's choice. Due to its guaranteed return of 4 regardless of player 2's strategy, player 1's U strategy is a dominant strategy. The strategy R is dominating for player 2 because it always outperforms the strategy L, regardless of what player 1 does. As a result, (U, R) is the Nash equilibrium for a game with pure strategies, with player 1 using U and player 2 using R. Finding the optimal hybrid approach Nash equilibrium allows us to determine whether or not, given the other player's mixed strategy, there is any reason for either player to deviate from their own. Suppose players 1 and 2 are both using the same probability distribution, where 1 has a chance of playing U and 1 of playing D, and 2 has a chance of playing L and 1 of playing R. The expected return for Player 1 is p(4) + (1-p)(7), while that for Player 2 is q(-3) + (1-q) (1). The optimal response for Player 1 is a U with probability 1, while the optimal response for Player 2 is a R with probability 1. As a result, the game lacks a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. In conclusion, the game has a single pure strategy Nash equilibrium at (U, R), but no mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.
