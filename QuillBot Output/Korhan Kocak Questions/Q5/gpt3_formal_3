In a game with vNM preferences, a pure approach is ineffective. The Nash equilibrium is a pair of strategies (one for each player) such that neither person can increase their payout by altering their approach while the other player maintains theirs. A mixed approach The Nash equilibrium is a pair of probability distributions across strategies such that no player can increase their anticipated payoff by altering their approach while the other player maintains their strategy. To discover the ideal technique Using Nash equilibria, we can determine whether each player has a dominating strategy, which is a strategy that always provides a greater reward than any other plan, independent of the other player's approach. The strategy U is a dominant strategy for player 1 since it always results in a reward of 4 regardless of player 2's approach. R is a dominant strategy for player 2 since it delivers a greater reward than L regardless of player 1's approach. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium for pure strategies is (U, R), where player 1 plays U and player 2 plays R. To determine the mixed approach Given the other player's mixed strategy, we can test if there is no incentive for either player to depart from their own mixed strategy under Nash equilibrium. Player 1 plays U with probability p and D with probability -1-p, whereas player 2 plays L with probability q and R with probability -1-q. Player 1's projected return is p(4) + (1-p)(7), while Player 2's is q(-3) + (1-q) (1). Player 1's optimal response is U with probability 1, whereas Player 2's optimal response is R with probability 1. Therefore, there is no Nash equilibrium for mixed strategies in this game. The pure strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is (U, R), and no mixed strategy Nash equilibrium exists.
