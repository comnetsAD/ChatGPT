A simple tactic A collection of tactics known as a Nash equilibrium exists when no player can enhance their results by unilaterally altering their approach while the others maintain their fixed strategy. In a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, no player may increase their anticipated result by altering their probability distribution while the other players' probability distributions remain constant. The first player in this game possesses the pure tactics U and D, while the second player has the pure strategies L and R. We'll start by thinking about the pure strategy Nash equilibrium. In the event that player 1 selects U, player 2 will choose R to get the highest payout of 7. In the event that player 1 selects D, player 2 will choose L to get the highest payout of 7. As a result, the Nash equilibria (U, R) and (D, L) are both pure strategy equilibria. We shall now talk about the Nash equilibrium for a mixed strategy. Player 1 can provide strategy U and D probability of p and 1-p, respectively, while Player 2 may give L and R probabilities of q and 1-q. The predicted payout for Player 1 using strategies U and D is 4p + 7(1-p) and 7p + 1, respectively (1-p). As a result, player 1 should adopt strategy U if 4p + 7(1-p) >= 7p + 1(1-p), and strategy D in all other cases. This results in p >= 3/5. In a similar vein, player 2's anticipated gain from strategies L and R is 4q + 1(1-q) and -3q + 7, respectively (1-q). The optimum course of action for player 2 is to choose strategy L in the event where 4q + 1(1-q) >= -3q + 7(1-q) and strategy R in all other cases. resulting in q >= 3/5 Therefore, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (p, q) = (3/5, 3/5). In conclusion, the game has one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (p, q) = (3/5, 3/5) where player 1 picks L with probability 3/5 and R with probability 2/5 and player 2 chooses L with probability 3/5 and R with probability 2/5. The game also contains two pure strategy Nash equilibria (U, R) and (D, L).
