This is a competitive game in which each player has their own set of strategies, numbered from one to one hundred. The amount of money won by each player is determined by the strategies used by all of the participants, and the objective for each player is to win the most money possible. In order to locate the Nash equilibrium for pure strategy, we need to examine all of the possible strategy profiles and determine whether or not any player can improve her reward by altering her approach while the other players maintain their strategies. Let's say that Player 1, Player 2, and Player 3 each go with a strategy that we'll refer to as x, y, and z respectively. In the event that x, y, and z are not the same, the player whose total is closer to two-thirds of the average will be awarded one dirham. The average of the three integers is denoted by the expression (x+y+z)/3, and two-thirds of the average is denoted by the expression (2/3)(x+y+z)/3. The winner is the participant whose number is closest to being equal to this value. In the event where x, y, and z are all the same, the dirham will be distributed fairly among the players. Consequently, the payment for player 1 is the following: u1(x, y, z) = 1 if x is closest to (2/3)(x+y+z)/3, 1/3 if x = y = z, and 0 otherwise. In addition, the payment for player 3 is as follows: u3(x, y, z) = 1 if z is closest to (2/3)(x+y+z)/3, 1/3 if x = y = z, and 0 otherwise. In this particular game, the only Nash equilibrium that involves pure strategy is the one in which all three players choose the same number, which is represented by the equation x = y = z = 34. It is the only strategy that, regardless of the decisions made by the other players, ensures that every player will receive the same amount of payment.
