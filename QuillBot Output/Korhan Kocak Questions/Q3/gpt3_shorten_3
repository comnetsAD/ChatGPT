This non-cooperative game includes players with strategy sets of 1, 2,..., 100. Each player wants to maximize her payout, which depends on all players' strategies. We must verify all strategy profiles to determine the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. No player can maximize her payout by altering her strategy while the other players keep their strategies. Player 1, 2, and 3's strategies are x, y, and z. The player closest to 2/3 of the average earns 1 dirham if x, y, and z are different. 2/3 of the average is 2/3(x+y+z)/3. Player with closest number wins. The dirham is divided equally among participants if x, y, and z are the same. Player 1 gets 1 if x is closest to (2/3)(x+y+z)/3, 1/3 if x = y = z, and 0 otherwise. Player 2 receives 1 if y is closest to (2/3)(x+y+z)/3, 1/3 if x = y = z, and 0 otherwise. Player 3 gets 1 if z is closest to (2/3)(x+y+z)/3, 1/3 if x = y = z, and 0 otherwise. The only pure-strategy Nash equilibrium in this game is when all three players pick 34. Only this technique provides an equal payout for all participants regardless of their choices. The strategy profile (34, 34, 34) is a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium because any player who deviates from strategy 34 will receive less than 1/3 dirhams.
