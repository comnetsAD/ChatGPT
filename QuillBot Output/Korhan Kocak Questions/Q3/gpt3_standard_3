Each player in this non-cooperative game has a selection of strategies ranging from 1, 2,..., 100. The strategy that each player chooses will determine her payment, and each player's objective is to maximize her payoff. We must examine every potential strategy profile to determine the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium and determine whether any player may increase her payout by altering her strategy while the other players maintain their strategies. The tactics picked by players 1, 2, and 3 will be denoted as x, y, and z, accordingly. The player whose number is closest to 2/3 of the average wins 1 dirham if x, y, and z are different. (x+y+z)/3 is the average of the three numbers, while (2/3)(x+y+z)/3 is 2/3 of the average. The winner is the player whose number comes closest to this sum. The dirham is divided equally among the players if x, y, and z are the same. Therefore, player 1's reward is as follows: u1(x, y, z) = 1 if x is closest to (2/3)(x+y+z)/3, 1/3 if x = y = z, and 0 otherwise. Likewise, player 2's reward is as follows: u2(x, y, z) = 1 if y is closest to (2/3)(x+y+z)/3, 1/3 if x = y = z, and 0 otherwise. And player 3 receives the following reward: u3(x, y, z) = 1 if z is closest to (2/3)(x+y+z)/3, 1/3 if x = y = z, and 0 otherwise. The only pure-strategy Nash equilibrium in this game is when all three players choose the same number, which is x = y = z = 34. It is the only tactic that ensures that no matter what the other players decide, everyone will receive an equal reward. In other words, the strategy profile (34, 34, 34) is a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium because if any player deviates from the strategy 34, they will receive less than 1/3 dirhams and would not gain any advantage by doing so.
