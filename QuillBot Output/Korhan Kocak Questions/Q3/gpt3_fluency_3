This is a non-cooperative game in which each player has a set of strategies numbered 1, 2,..., 100. The payoff for each player is determined by the strategies chosen by all players, and each player's goal is to maximize her payoff. To find the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, we must examine all possible strategy profiles and determine whether no player can increase her payoff by changing her strategy while the other players maintain their strategies. Let us refer to x, y, and z as the strategies chosen by players 1 through 3. If x, y, and z differ, the player whose number is closest to two-thirds of the average wins one dirham. The sum of the three numbers is (x+y+z)/3, and two-thirds of the sum is (2/3)(x+y+z)/3. The player with the closest number to this value wins. If x, y, and z are all the same, the dirham is distributed evenly among the players. So, for player 1, the payoff is: u1(x, y, z) = 1 if x is closest to (2/3)(x+y+z)/3, 1/3 if x = y = z, and 0 otherwise. Similarly, for player 2, the payoff is as follows: u2(x, y, z) = 1 if y is closest to (2/3)(x+y+z)/3, 1/3 if x = y = z, and 0 otherwise. And for player 3, the payoff is as follows: u3(x, y, z) = 1 if z is closest to (2/3)(x+y+z)/3, 1/3 if x = y = z, 0 otherwise. A pure-strategy Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile (x*, y*, z*) such that for each player I and each strategy si in Si, we have: u(si*, sj*, sk*) >= u(si*, sj*, sk*), for every j, k = 1, 2, 3, and j!= k. The only pure-strategy Nash equilibrium in this game is one in which all three players choose the same number, x = y = z = 34. It is the only strategy that ensures an equal payoff for all players regardless of the other players' choices. In other words, if any player deviates from strategy 34, they will earn less than one-third of a dirham, so they will gain no advantage, and thus the strategy profile (34, 34, 34) is a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium.
