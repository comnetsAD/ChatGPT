We must think about every possible combination of strategies for each player in order to identify the pure-strategy Nash equilibria of this game. These equilibria are those in which no player can increase their payoff by selecting a different strategy given the strategies chosen by the other players. Let's analyze each player's approach separately. Player 1: The first participant may choose any number between 1 and 100. Let's designate the number selected by the first participant as x1. Second player: The second player is likewise free to choose any number between 1 and 100. Let's give the number selected by the second player, x2, a name. Third player: This player has the option of selecting any number from 1 to 100. Let's give the number selected by the third player the name x3. A player who selects a number that is closest to the average of the three integers they have picked will win the dirham. The average is just the sum of the three numbers divided by three if all three are different. In this instance, the winner of the dirham is the player whose integer is closest to 2/3 of the average. The average of two identical integers is the total of the two divided by two. In this situation, the two players whose numbers are closest to 2/3 the average are awarded the dirham. The average is only the integer if all three integers are the same. The dirham is therefore divided equally among all participants in this situation. An all-out approach A Nash equilibrium is a set of tactics where no player can benefit from altering his strategy as long as the other players' plans don't change. The only pure-strategy equilibrium that can exist when everyone chooses the same number is when everyone has the same aim and the same strategy space. In this scenario, each player will get a third of the dirham, and no player will stand to benefit by altering his approach. Therefore, all players selecting the same integer from 1 to 100 constitutes the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium of this game.
