Each player in this competitive game can choose from a pool of strategies ranging from 1 to 100. Each player's goal is to maximize her reward, which is determined by the methods taken by all players. If no player can improve her payout by switching strategies while the other players maintain their current ones, then we have found the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. To keep things simple, let's refer to the plans that Players 1 and 2 have made as "x" and "y" and "z" correspondingly. The player whose total is closest to two-thirds of the mean, if x, y, and z are all different, wins 1 dirham. You may write (2/3)(x+y+z)/3 as 2/3 of the average of the three numbers (x+y+z)/3), which is simply the average of the three values. The winner is the contestant whose final score is closest to this value. In the event that x, y, and z are all the same, the dirham is distributed evenly among the participants. Payoff for player 1 is therefore: u1(x, y, z) = 1 if x is closest to (2/3)(x+y+z)/3, 1/3 if x = y = z, 0 otherwise A similar formula is used to determine Player 2's payout: u2(x, y, z) = 1 if y is closest to (2/3)(x+y+z)/3, 1/3 if x = y = z, 0 otherwise. Player 3 is rewarded with u3(x, y, z) = 1 if z (2/3)(x+y+z)/3, u3(x, y, z) = 1/3 if x = y = z, and u3(x, y, z) = 0 otherwise. In a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, each player, I has a strategy profile (x*, y*, z*) such that, for any j, k = 1, 2, 3, and j!= k, u(si*, sj*, sk*) >= u(si, sj, sk*). The only pure-strategy Nash equilibrium in this game is when all three players select the same number, x = y = z = 34. It's the only tactic that ensures everybody wins no matter what the other people do. In other words, the strategy profile (34, 34, 34) is a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium because any player that deviates from the strategy 34 will receive less than 1/3 dirhams, giving them no advantage.
