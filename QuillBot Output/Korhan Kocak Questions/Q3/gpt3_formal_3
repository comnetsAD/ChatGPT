This is a non-cooperative game in which each participant has a set of 100 strategies. Each player's payment is contingent on the strategies selected by the other players, and each player's objective is to maximize her payoff. To discover the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, we must examine all potential strategy profiles and ensure that no player may maximize her payout by switching tactics while the other players maintain theirs. Let's refer to the strategies adopted by players 1, 2, and 3 as x, y, and z, accordingly. (x+y+z)/3 is the average of the three numbers, while (2/3)(x+y+z)/3 is 2/3 of the average. The winner is the player whose number is closest to this figure. If x, y, and z are identical, then the dirham is divided evenly amongst the players. It is the only method that assures a payout of parity for all players regardless of their opponents' decisions.
