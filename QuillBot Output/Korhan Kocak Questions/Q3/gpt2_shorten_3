To identify the pure-strategy Nash equilibria of this game, we must analyze all potential strategies for each player and determine which strategy combinations result in a scenario where no person can increase their reward by selecting a different strategy given the strategies selected by other players. Consider each player's plan. Starter: First player chooses any number from 1 to 100. First player's integer is x1. 2nd player: Choose any number from 1 to 100. Second player's integer is x2. 3rd player: Choose any number from 1 to 100. Third player's integer is x3. Players must pick a number that is closest to 2/3 the average of the 3 integers chosen to win the dirham. The average of three distinct integers is the total divided by 3. The dirham goes to the player whose integer is closest to 2/3 the average. The average of two identical integers is the total divided by 2. The dirham is distributed between the two players with integers closest to 2/3 the average. The average of three identical numbers is the integer. Thus, all players share the dirham. Strategy-only Nash equilibrium is a strategy combination where altering one's approach does not benefit the other players. The only pure-strategy equilibrium is when all players select the same integer because all players have the same strategy space and goal. In this situation, each player gets 1/3 of the dirham and cannot benefit by changing tactics. The pure-strategy Nash equilibrium of this game is all players picking the same integer from 1 to 100.
