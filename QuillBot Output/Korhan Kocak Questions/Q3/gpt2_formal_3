To determine the pure-strategy Nash equilibria of this game, we must consider all possible strategies for each player and determine which strategy combinations result in a situation where no player can improve their payoff by selecting a different strategy, given the strategies selected by the other players. Consider the strategies of each player separately. 1st actor: The first player may choose any number between 1 and 100. Let's refer to the number selected by the first player as x1. The second player may also choose any number between 1 and 100. Let's refer to the number selected by the second player as x2. The third player may also choose any number between 1 and 100. Let's refer to the number selected by the third player as x3. To win the dirham, a player must choose a number that is closest to 2/3 of the average of the three integers selected by the other players. If all three numbers are distinct, the mean is just the sum of the numbers divided by 3. In this instance, the winner is the player whose integer is closest to 2/3 of the average. If two integers are identical, the average equals their sum divided by 2. The dirham is thus divided between the two players whose integers are closest to 2/3 of the average. If all three numbers are identical, the average equals the integer itself. In this instance, the dirham is divided among all participants. A pure-strategy The Nash equilibrium is a combination of tactics in which no player may benefit by altering his strategy if the strategies of the other players stay intact. Due to the fact that all players share the same strategy space and goal, the only feasible pure-strategy equilibrium occurs when all players pick the same number. In this instance, each player will get one-third of the dirham, and no player may benefit from a change in tactics. Therefore, the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium of this game consists of all players selecting the same number between 1 and 100.
