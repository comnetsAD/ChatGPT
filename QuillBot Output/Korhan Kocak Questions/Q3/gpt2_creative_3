Finding the pure-strategy Nash equilibria of this game requires thinking about all possible strategies for each player and seeing which combinations of strategies lead to a situation where no player can improve their payoff by choosing a different strategy given the strategies chosen by the other players. Let's go down the strategies of the different participants. In the first position: The game begins with the first participant selecting a number between 1 and 100. The number selected by the first player will be denoted by x1. The second player may also choose an integer value between 1 and 100. The second player's integer will be denoted as x2. Finally, the third player may choose any whole number from 1 to 100. The third player chooses an integer, which we'll label x3. One player will win the dirham if their selected integer is closer to two-thirds of the average of the three players' integers. If the three numbers are distinct, then the average is calculated by dividing the total by 3. Therefore, the player whose integer is closest to 2/3 of the mean will be awarded the dirham. In case of equality between integers, the average is calculated as the sum of the numbers divided by 2. The dirham is divided equally between the two players whose scores are closest to two-thirds of the mean in integer form. When all three numbers are integers, the average is the middle number. The dirham is thus distributed equally among all participants. A purely strategic approach A Nash equilibrium is a set of player strategies in which no one wins by switching tactics so long as everyone else keeps theirs the same. The only feasible pure-strategy equilibrium is when all players pick the same number, because they all share the same strategy space and the same aim. In this scenario, the dirham will be divided into thirds, and no player will benefit from a change in tactics. This game's pure-strategy Nash equilibrium consists of all players selecting the same integer between 1 and 100.
