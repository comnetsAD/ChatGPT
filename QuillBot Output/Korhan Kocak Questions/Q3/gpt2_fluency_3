To identify the game's pure-strategy Nash equilibria, we must analyze all feasible strategies for each player and establish which strategy combinations result in a scenario in which no person can increase their payout by selecting a different strategy given the strategies selected by the other players. Consider each player's plan separately. First player: The first player may choose any number between 1 and 100. Let us refer to the number picked by the first player as x1. The second player may also choose any number between 1 and 100. Let us refer to the number picked by the second player as x2. The third player may also choose any number between 1 and 100. Let us refer to the number picked by the third player as x3. To win the dirham, a player must choose a number that is closest to 2/3 the average of the three integers selected by the other players. If each of the three numbers is distinct, the average is just the sum of the integers divided by three. In this situation, the player whose integer comes closest to two-thirds of the average gets the dirham. When two integers are equal, the average is the total of the numbers divided by two. In this situation, the dirham is divided equally between the two players whose integers are closest to two-thirds of the average. The average is just the integer if all three numbers are the same. In this situation, the dirham is divided among all participants. A one-of-a-kind plan Nash equilibrium is a strategy combination in which no player gains by altering his strategy if the other players' tactics stay intact. Because all players have the same strategy space and the same goal, the only pure-strategy equilibrium is one in which all players pick the same number. In this situation, each player will get a third of the dirham, and no player will benefit from modifying his approach. As a result, the game's pure-strategy Nash equilibrium involves all players selecting the same number from 1 to 100.
