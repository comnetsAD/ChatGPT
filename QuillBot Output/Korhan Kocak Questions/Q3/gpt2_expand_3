In order to locate the pure-strategy Nash equilibria of this game, we need to take into account all of the possible strategies for each player and figure out which strategy combinations lead to a situation in which no player can improve their payoff by selecting a different strategy given the strategies that have been chosen by the other players. Only then will we have found the pure-strategy Nash equilibria. Let's go into the strategies used by each individual player. The first player: The person who goes first gets to choose an integer between 1 and 100. Let's name the integer that the first player chooses x1, shall we? 2nd Player: The second player may choose any integer from 1 to 100 as well. Let's name the integer that the second player chooses x2, shall we? The third player may also choose any number from 1 to 100. This player's options are as follows: Let's refer to the number selected by the third player as x3, shall we? In order to take home the dirham, a player must choose a number that comes as near as possible to being 2/3 the same as the average of the three integers that the other players have picked. If there is a difference between each of the three numbers, then the average is just the total of the integers divided by 3. Therefore, in this situation, the player whose integer comes closest to being equal to two-thirds of the average will win the dirham. In the event where two numbers are identical, the average is calculated by dividing the total number of integers by 2. Because of this, the dirham will be divided equally between the two players whose integers come the closest to being 2/3 of the average. If there is no difference between any of the three numbers, then the average is just the integer itself. In this scenario, the dirham is distributed equally among all of the participants. A pure-strategy A game is said to be in a state of Nash equilibrium when all of the players' tactics are combined in such a way that no one can advance their position by altering their own play if the other players' strategies stay unaltered. Since all of the players have access to the same strategy space and are competing to achieve the same goal, the only viable equilibrium that relies only on strategy is one in which all of the players choose the same number. In this scenario, every player will get one-third of the dirham, and no one will benefit by altering their game strategy. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium for this game requires that all of the players choose the same integer from the range 1 to 100.
