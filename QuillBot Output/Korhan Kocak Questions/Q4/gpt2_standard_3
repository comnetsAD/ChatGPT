We have two candidates, A and B, who are vying for the most electoral college votes in this variation of a one-dimensional electoral contest. The contest may be seen of as a two-stage game, with the public casting their votes after the candidates have chosen their stances on many issues. First-round candidates will base their stances on the preferred policies in each state, m1 and m2, as determined by the median. Since m2 > m1, it is obvious that candidate A would go for a policy stance that is closer to m2, while candidate B will opt for a position that is more closely aligned with m1. The people of state 1 will vote for candidate B in the second round, while the people of state 2 will vote for candidate A. This is due to the fact that candidate B is closest to the position in state 1 that the median prefers, whereas candidate A is closest to the position in state 2. With this result, the candidates won't have any motivation to stray from their preferred policy stances. Therefore, candidate A should choose a policy stance that is closest to m2, and candidate B should select a position that is closest to m1, according to the game's pure strategy Nash equilibrium. It is important to note that there is only one pure strategy Nash equilibrium in this game since the candidates cannot benefit by selecting any other positions because doing so would not alter the results of the voting phase.
