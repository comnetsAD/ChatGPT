Each candidate in this non-cooperative game has a variety of strategies that they may use, where mi stands for the median position among state i's residents. Each candidate's reward is determined by the methods she chooses, and each contender wants to maximize her payoff. We must examine all potential strategy profiles to determine the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium and determine if no contender can maximize her payout by altering her approach while the other candidate maintains her strategy. Let's refer to the tactics that candidates 1 and 2, respectively, picked as x and y. Candidate 1 will get the following payout: u1(x, y) = 100 if x wins state 1 and y wins state 2; 80 if x wins state 1; 90 if x wins state 1 and the candidates tie in state 2; and 0 otherwise. In a similar vein, candidate 2's reward is as follows: u2(x, y) = 80 if y wins state 1 and x wins state 2, 100 if y wins state 1 and y wins state 2, and 90 if y wins state 1 and the candidates tie in state 2. A pure-strategy Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile (x*, y*) where we have u(si*, sj*) >= u(si, sj*) for every candidate I and every strategy si in Si. It is obvious that candidate 1 will not choose a place higher than m1 given that m2m1. Similar rules apply to candidate 2 and positions higher than m2. Since the two candidates pick m1 and m2, this is the only pure strategy Nash equilibrium that is attainable. The strategy profile (m1, m2) is a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium because, in other words, if any candidate departs from their strategy, they would get fewer than 90 electoral votes and would not gain any benefit by doing so.
