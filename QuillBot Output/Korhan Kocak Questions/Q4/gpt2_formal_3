In this form of a one-dimensional electoral contest, candidates A and B are competing for the most electoral college votes. The game may be portrayed as a two-stage game, with the candidates selecting their policy stances in the first stage and the public voting in the second stage. In the first round, candidates will choose their policy positions based on the preferred positions of the medians in each state, m1 and m2. Since m2 > m1, it is evident that candidate A will choose a policy stance that is closer to m2 and candidate B will select a policy position that is closer to m1. State 1 residents will vote for candidate B, whereas state 2 residents will vote for candidate A. This is due to the fact that candidate B is closest to the median's preferred stance in state 1 while candidate A is closest in state 2. Given this result, there will be little motivation for candidates to depart from their selected policy stances. Consequently, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium of the game requires candidate A to choose the policy position closest to m2 and candidate B to select the policy position closest to m1. It is important to note that there is only one pure strategy Nash equilibrium in this game, since the candidates cannot gain any advantage by adopting alternative positions, as this would not affect the result of the voting stage.
