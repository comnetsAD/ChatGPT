A straightforward strategy Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player, in which no player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy while the other players' remain constant. Each candidate in this game selects a single policy position. Let x1 and x2 represent the two candidates' respective policy positions. The number of electoral college votes a candidate receives determines their payoff. This is: (1) 100(x1 - m1)2 + 80(x2 - m2)2 for candidate 1. (2) 100(x2 - m1)2 + 80(x2 - m2)2 for candidate 2. By setting the derivative of each player's payoff with respect to their own strategy to zero and solving for their strategy, we can find the pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Taking (1)'s derivative with respect to x1, we get: -200x1 + 200m1 = 0. So, x1 = m1. Taking the derivative of (2) with respect to x2, we get the following: -200x2 + 200m1 + 80 = 0. So, x2 = (200m1 + 80) / 200 Thus, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium in this game is (x1, x2) = (m1, (200m1 + 80) / 200). As a result, candidates will always select the median position in the state that provides them with the most electoral votes.
