Unadulterated tactic A Nash equilibrium consists of a collection of player strategies such that no one can enhance their outcome by changing their strategy while the other players maintain theirs at a constant level. Each player picks a single policy stance to defend. Let's say x1 and x2 represent the candidates' respective policy stances in this election. Each candidate's payout is based on their share of the Electoral College vote. First, let's look at (1) 100(x1 - m1)2 + 80(x2 - m2)2. The formula for the second candidate is (2) 100(x2 - m1)2 + 80(x2 - m2)2. By setting each player's payoff derivative with regard to their own strategy to zero and solving for their strategy, we can discover the pure strategy Nash equilibrium. If we evaluate (1)'s derivative in terms of x1, we get -200x1 + 200m1 = 0. So, x1 = m1. If we evaluate (2)'s derivative in terms of x2, we get -200x2 + 200m1 + 80 = 0. So, x2 = (200m1 + 80) / 200 For this game, the Nash equilibrium (x1, x2) equals (m1, (200m1 + 80) / 200) when using a pure strategy. Candidates will always pick the middle ground in a state if it means more electoral votes for them.
