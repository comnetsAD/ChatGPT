This is a competitive game in which players do not work together to achieve their goals. Each candidate has a strategy set consisting of m1, m2,..., mn, where mi represents the stance that is most popular among the residents of state i. Each candidate's reward is determined by the tactics adopted by both candidates, and the objective for each contender is to maximize her own payoff as much as possible. In order to establish the Nash equilibrium for pure strategy, we need to verify all of the potential strategy profiles and determine whether or not either of the candidates may improve their payoff by altering their approach while the other candidate maintains their strategy. Let's say candidate 1 went with strategy x, while candidate 2 went with strategy y. Let's refer to them as their respective election tactics. The payoff for candidate 1 is as follows: u1(x, y) = 100 if candidate x wins state 1 and candidate y wins state 2; 80 if candidate x wins state 1 and candidate x wins state 2; 90 if candidate x wins state 1 and the candidates tie in state 2; 0 if candidate x does not win state 1 or state 2; 0 if candidate x does not win state 1. In a similar vein, the payout for candidate 2 is as follows: u2(x, y) = 80 if y wins state 1 and x wins state 2 100 if y wins state 1 and y wins state 2 90 if y wins state 1 and the candidates tie in state 2 0 if y wins state 1 and the candidates tie in state 2 else A pure-strategy Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile (x*, y*) such that for every candidate I and for every strategy si in Si, we have: u(si*, sj*) >= u(si, sj*), for every j = 1, 2, etc. A pure-strategy Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile (x*, y*) such that for every candidate I and for every strategy si in The fact that m2 is bigger than m1 makes it quite evident that candidate 1 will not choose a position that is greater than m1. The same is true for candidate 2 and places higher than m2 in the ranking system. As a result, the only pure strategy Nash equilibrium that is even remotely plausible is the one in which the two candidates choose m1 and m2 in that order. Therefore, the strategy profile (m1, m2) is a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. To put it another way, if any candidate deviates from their strategy, they would get less than 90 electoral votes, which means that they would not gain any benefit by doing so.
