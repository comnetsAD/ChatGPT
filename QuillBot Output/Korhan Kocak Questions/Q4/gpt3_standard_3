A simple tactic A collection of strategies known as a Nash equilibrium exists when no player can improve their results by unilaterally altering their approach while the others maintain their fixed strategy. Each player in this game choose a single policy position. Let x1 and x2 represent the two candidates' respective policy stances. The amount of electoral college votes a candidate receives determines how much money they will earn. This is the formula for Candidate 1: (1) 100(x1 - m1) + 80(x2 - m2) This is the formula for candidate 2: (2) 100(x2 - m1) + 80(x2 - m2). By setting the derivative of each player's reward with regard to their own strategy to zero and solving for their strategy, we may determine the pure strategy Nash equilibrium. When we apply the derivative of (1) to x1, we obtain: -200x1 + 200m1 = 0. So, x1 = m1. With respect to x2, we may calculate the derivative of (2) as follows: -200x2 + 200m1 + 80 = 0. So, x2 = (200m1 + 80) / 200 The pure strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is (x1, x2) = (m1, (200m1 + 80) / 200). As a result, the candidates always go for the state's middle stance that provides them the most electoral votes.
