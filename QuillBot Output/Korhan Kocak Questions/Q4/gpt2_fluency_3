We have two candidates, A and B, competing for the most electoral college votes in this variation of one-dimensional electoral rivalry. The game may be divided into two stages, with the first stage consisting of candidates selecting their policy stances and the second consisting of voters voting. The contenders will determine their policy stances in the first stage based on the median favored positions in each state, m1 and m2. Given that m2 m1, it is obvious that candidate A would choose for a policy stance closer to m2, while candidate B will opt for a policy position closer to m1. People in state 1 will vote for candidate B, whereas citizens in state 2 will vote for candidate A in the second stage. This is due to the fact that candidate B is closest to the median's preferred position in state 1, while candidate A is closest to the median's preferred position in state 2. Given this scenario, the candidates will have no need to depart from their preferred policy views. As a result, the game's pure strategy Nash equilibrium is for candidate A to choose a policy position closest to m2 and candidate B to select a policy position closest to m1. It is worth emphasizing that there is only one pure strategy Nash equilibrium in this game, since the candidates will gain no advantage by selecting any other positions because it will not influence the result of the voting stage.
