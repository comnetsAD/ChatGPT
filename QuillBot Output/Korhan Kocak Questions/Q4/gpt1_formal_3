This is a non-cooperative game in which each candidate has a strategy set of m1, m2,..., mn, where mi is the preferred position of the median citizen of state i. Each candidate's payment is contingent on the methods she employs, and each candidate's objective is to maximize her payoff. To locate the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, we must examine all potential strategy profiles and ensure that neither candidate may maximize her payout by altering her approach while the other candidate maintains hers. Let's refer to the various tactics selected by candidates 1 and 2 as x and y. u1(x, y) = 100 if x wins state 1 and y wins state 2; 80 if x wins state 1 and x wins state 2; 90 if x wins state 1 and there is a tie in state 2; and 0 otherwise. u2(x, y) = 80 if y wins state 1 and x wins state 2; 100 if y wins state 1 and y wins state 2; 90 if y wins state 1 and the candidates tie in state 2; and 0 otherwise. A pure-strategy Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile (x*, y*) such that for each candidate I and each strategy si in Si, we have: u(si*, sj*) >= u(si, sj*), for any value of j between 1 and 2. Given that m2 is less than m1, it is evident that candidate 1 will not choose a position higher than m1. The same holds true for candidate 2 and positions beyond m2. Therefore, the only viable pure strategy Nash equilibrium is one in which both candidates pick m1 and m2. Therefore, the strategy profile (m1, m2) is a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium.
