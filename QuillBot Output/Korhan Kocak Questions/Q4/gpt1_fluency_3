This is a non-cooperative game in which each candidate has a strategy set of m1, m2,..., mn, where mi is the median citizen of state i's favored position. The reward for each candidate is determined by the methods adopted by both candidates, and each contender's purpose is to maximize her payoff. To discover the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, we must examine all potential strategy profiles and determine whether neither contender can maximize her payout by altering her approach while the other candidate maintains her strategy. Let us refer to x and y as the tactics selected by candidates 1 and 2, respectively. u1(x, y) = 100 if x wins state 1 and y wins state 2 80 if x wins state 1 and y wins state 2 90 if x wins state 1 and the candidates tie in state 2 0 else Similarly, the payout for candidate 2 is as follows: u2(x, y) = 80 if y wins state 1 and x wins state 2 100 if y wins state 1 and y wins state 2 90 if y wins state 1 and the candidates tie in state 2 0 if y does not win state 1 A pure-strategy Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile (x*, y*) such that for every candidate I and strategy si in Si, we have: u(si*, sj*) >= u(si, sj*), where j = 1, 2 Given m2m1, it is obvious that candidate 1 will not choose a position larger than m1. The same is true for candidate 2 and places above m2. As a result, the only pure strategy Nash equilibrium is one in which the two candidates choose m1 and m2, respectively. In other words, if any candidate deviates from their strategy, they will get fewer than 90 electoral votes, thus gaining no advantage, and so the strategy profile (m1, m2) is a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium.
