There is no coordination between the candidates in this game; rather, they each have their own set of strategies, represented by the integers m1, m2,..., mn, where mi is the median preferred position of the residents of state i. Each candidate's purpose is to maximize her payout, which is proportional to the methods she and the other candidate adopt. The pure-strategy Nash equilibrium is reached when neither player can improve their payout by switching strategies while the other player maintains theirs. The approaches used by Candidates 1 and 2 will be denoted by x and y. u1(x, y) = 100 if x wins state 1 and y wins state 2, 80 if x wins state 1 and y wins state 2, 90 if x wins state 1 and the candidates tie in state 2, and 0 if x wins state 1 and y wins state 2. Similar to how u2(x, y) = 80 if y wins state 1 and x wins state 2, u2(x, y) = 100 if y wins state 1 and x wins state 2, and u2(x, y) = 90 if y wins state 1 and the candidates tie in state 2, and u2(x, y) = 0 otherwise. In a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, for each candidate I and each strategy si in Si, we have: u(si*, sj*) >= u(si, sj*), for all j = 1, 2, etc. The fact that m2 is less than m1 makes it evident that candidate 1 will not go for a higher position. The same is true for Option 2 with coordinates bigger than m2. That leaves a pure strategy Nash equilibrium in which the two candidates choose m1 and m2 as their strategies. Specifically, the strategy profile (m1, m2) is a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium because any candidate that deviates from their strategy would get less than 90 electoral votes, giving them no advantage.
