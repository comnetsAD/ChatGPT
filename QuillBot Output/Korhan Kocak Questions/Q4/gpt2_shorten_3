A and B compete for electoral college votes in this one-dimensional electoral rivalry. Candidates choose their policy stances, and voters vote. In the first step, candidates will pick policy positions based on the median's favored positions in each state, m1 and m2. Since m2 < m1, candidate A will select a policy stance closer to m2 and candidate B to m1. In the second stage, state 1 voters will choose B while state 2 voters will choose A. This is because candidate B is closest to the median's favored position in state 1 while candidate A is closest in state 2. This consequence will discourage candidates from changing their policy stances. Thus, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium of the game is for candidate A to pick m2 and candidate B to choose m1. In this game, there is only one pure strategy Nash equilibrium since the candidates' choices will not affect the voting stage.
