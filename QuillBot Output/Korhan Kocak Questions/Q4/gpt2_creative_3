Here, we have two candidates, A and B, each of whom is vying for the support of the electorate in a manner similar to a traditional election contest, but with just one dimension. The candidates' policy choices reflect the first stage of the game, while the public' votes represent the second. In the first phase, candidates will choose policy stances in accordance with the median preferences (m1) and second-most-preferred (m2) views across states. Candidates A and B will both take a policy stance that is more in line with their respective medians, as m2 is larger than m1. At this second round of voting, residents of State 1 will choose Candidate B while those of State 2 will choose Candidate A. This is due to the fact that in state 1, candidate B is closer to the median's preferred stance than candidate A is in state 2. The candidates will have no need to change their previously stated policy stances if this occurs. For this reason, the game's pure strategy Nash equilibrium requires that candidate A choose the policy position closest to m2 and candidate B pick the policy position closest to m1. It's important to remember that there's only one pure strategy Nash equilibrium in this game, as the candidates can't gain an edge by picking different positions and doing so wouldn't affect the final result of the voting round anyhow.
