In this non-cooperative game, each candidate's strategy set is {m1, m2,..., mn}, where mi is the median's favored position among state I residents. Each candidate wants to maximize her payout, which relies on both competitors' methods. We must verify all strategy profiles to determine the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium. No contender can enhance her payout by altering her strategy while the other candidate retains her strategy. Candidate 1 and 2's tactics are x and y. Candidate 1 receives 100 if x wins state 1 and y wins state 2 80 if x wins state 1 and y wins state 2 90 if x wins state 1 and the candidates tie in state 2 0 else. Candidate 2's reward is: u2(x, y) = 80 if y wins state 1 and x wins state 2 100 if y wins both states 90 if the candidates tie in state 2 0 otherwise A pure-strategy Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile (x*, y*) such that for every candidate I and every strategy si in Si, u(si*, sj*) >= u(si, sj*), for every j = 1, 2. Since m2<m1, candidate 1 cannot select a position higher than m1. Candidate 2 and places above m2 follow suit. Thus, the only pure strategy Nash equilibrium is one where the candidates pick m1 and m2. The strategy profile (m1, m2) is a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium because any candidate that deviates from their strategy will get fewer than 90 electoral votes.
