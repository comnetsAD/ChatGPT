In this version of an election race with just one dimension, we have two candidates, A and B, who are vying to get the highest number of votes cast in the electoral college. The game may be thought of as taking place over the course of two stages: in the first stage, the candidates decide on their respective policy stances, and in the second stage, the voters cast their ballots. In the first step, the candidates will choose their policy stances in accordance with the median's preferred views in each state, which are denoted by m1 and m2. Given that m2 is greater than m1, it is obvious that candidate A would choose a policy stance that is closer to m2, whilst candidate B will select a policy position that is closer to m1. The residents of state 1 will vote for candidate B in the second stage, whereas the citizens of state 2 will vote for candidate A. This is due to the fact that candidate B is the one who is closest to the preferred position of the median in state 1, whilst candidate A is the one who is closest to the preferred position of the median in state 2. If this is the conclusion, the candidates will not have any reason to change from the policy stances they have selected for themselves. In light of this, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium of the game requires candidate A to select a policy stance that is closest to m2 and candidate B to pick a policy position that is closest to m1. It is important to note that there is only one pure strategy Nash equilibrium in this game. This is due to the fact that the candidates will not gain any advantage by adopting any other positions, since this would not influence the result of the voting stage.
