Pure strategy Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each participant, where no player can better their outcome by unilaterally altering their strategy while the others keep theirs. Each contestant picks one policy in this game. Candidates' policy positions are x1 and x2. Electoral college votes decide candidate payoffs. Candidate 1: 100(x1 - m1)^2 + 80(x2 - m2)^2. Candidate 2: 100(x2 - m1)^2 + 80(x2 - m2)^2. Setting each player's payoff derivative with regard to their strategy to zero and solving for their strategy yields the pure strategy Nash equilibrium. The derivative of (1) with regard to x1 is -200x1 + 200m1 = 0. So, x1 = m1. The derivative of (2) with regard to x2 is -200x2 + 200m1 + 80 = 0. So, x2 = (200m1 + 80) / 200 The pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (x1, x2) = (m1, (200m1 + 80) / 200). Thus, candidates will always choose the state median with the most electoral votes.
