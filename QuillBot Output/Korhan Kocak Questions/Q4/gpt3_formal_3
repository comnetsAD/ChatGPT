A pure strategy The Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can enhance their outcome by changing their approach unilaterally while the other players maintain theirs. Each contestant in this game choose a single policy position. Let x1 and x2 represent the respective policy positions adopted by the two candidates. The candidate's compensation is decided by the number of electoral college votes received. This is: (1) 100(x1 - m1)2 + 80(x2 - m2)2 for candidate 1. This is (2) 100(x2 - m1)2 + 80(x2 - m2)2 for candidate 2. We can determine the pure strategy Nash equilibrium by setting the payoff derivative of each player's strategy to zero and then solving for their strategy. So, x1 = m1. Obtaining the derivative of (2) with regard to x2, we obtain: -200x2 + 200m1 + 80 = 0. So, x2 = (200m1 + 80) / 200 Thus, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is (x1, x2) = (m1, (200m1 + 80) / 200. Therefore, candidates will always select the state's median position that yields the most electoral votes.
