A pure strategy Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can enhance their outcome by unilaterally changing their approach while the other players keep theirs fixed. This is because each player's strategy is unique to them, and the other players' strategies are fixed. During this round, each contender will select a single policy position to represent them. Let's say that x1 and x2 represent the policy stances that the two candidates have decided to take, respectively. The number of votes that a contender receives in the electoral college will decide how much money they will earn. This comes out to the following for candidate 1: (1) 100(x1 - m1)2 + 80(x2 - m2)2 This comes out to the following for candidate 2: (2) 100(x2 - m1)2 + 80(x2 - m2)2 We may get the Nash equilibrium for the pure strategy by first setting the derivative of each player's reward with respect to their own strategy to zero and then solving for the player's strategy. This will allow us to determine the pure strategy. We derive the following result by taking the derivative of (1) with regard to x1: -200x1 + 200m1 = 0. So, x1 = m1. When we take the derivative of the function (2) with respect to x2, we get the following result: -200x2 + 200m1 + 80 = 0. So, x2 = (200m1 + 80) / 200 In light of the foregoing, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is (x1, x2) = (m1, (200m1 + 80) / 200. As a result, the candidates will always opt for the position inside the state that places them in the middle and offers them the most electoral votes.
