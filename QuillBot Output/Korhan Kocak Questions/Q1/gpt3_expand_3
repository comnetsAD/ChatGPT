In the field of game theory, the Nash equilibrium is a concept that describes a solution to a non-cooperative game involving two or more players in which each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players and in which no player has anything to gain by changing only their own strategy. In this type of game, each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players. Given the tactics of the other players, a profile of strategies is considered to be in a state of Nash equilibrium if no player can improve their position by changing their strategy on their own unilaterally. A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can enhance their payoff by altering their strategy while the other players keep their strategies constant. In other words, a Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies. To put it another way, a Nash equilibrium is a situation in which the strategy employed by one player is optimal in light of the methods utilized by the other players. There may be more than one Nash equilibrium in a game, or there may be none at all. It is essential to keep in mind that the Nash equilibrium is merely a conceptual framework, and it is not a given that real-world scenarios will arrive at a Nash equilibrium. This is due to the fact that the Nash equilibrium is predicated on the assumptions of rational behavior and exhaustive knowledge.
