In game theory, the Nash equilibrium describes a situation in which all players have taken the optimal action, given the tactics of their opponents. John Nash, a future Nobel winner in economics, used the term in his thesis from 1950. In mathematical terms, a Nash equilibrium is a collection of player strategies where no player can increase their payout by altering their own strategy while the other players' strategies stay constant. Thus, a Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies where no player has any reason to modify their plan in light of the strategies of the other players. Let S i be the set of strategies accessible to player I in a game with n players, and let u i(s) denote player i's payout when the strategy profile is s = (s 1, s 2,..., s n). If for every I = 1, 2,..., n and for all s i in S i, we have: u i(s i*, s -i) >= u i(s i, s -i*), then the equilibrium strategy profile s* = (s 1*, s 2*,..., s n*) is a Nash equilibrium. To put it another way, a Nash equilibrium is the set of strategies where no player can maximize their reward by switching to a new strategy, given the strategies already selected by the other players.
