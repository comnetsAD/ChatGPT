The Nash equilibrium is a solution notion for a non-cooperative game with two or more players in which each player knows the equilibrium tactics of the other players and no person gains by changing simply their own strategy. A strategy profile is a Nash equilibrium if no player can do better by unilaterally changing their strategy given the tactics of the other players. Thus, a Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player, where no individual can improve their payoff by changing their strategy while the others keep theirs. Thus, in a Nash equilibrium, each player's approach is optimal given the other players' tactics. Games can have several Nash equilibria or none. The Nash equilibrium is dependent on rational conduct and complete information, hence it may not occur in real life.
