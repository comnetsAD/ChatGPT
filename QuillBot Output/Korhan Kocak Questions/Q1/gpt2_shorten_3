In game theory, the Nash equilibrium is a situation in which each player has selected the optimum strategy given the tactics of the other players. Nobel winner John Nash coined the term in his 1950 thesis. Formally, a Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one for each player, where no player can increase their reward by unilaterally altering their strategy while the other players' strategies stay constant. Thus, a collection of strategies is a Nash equilibrium if and only if no player has an incentive to modify their strategy given the strategies of other players. For a game with n players, let S i be player i's set of strategies and u i(s) be the reward when the strategy profile is s = (s 1, s 2,..., s n). Then, a strategy profile s* = (s 1*, s 2*,..., s n*) is a Nash equilibrium if and only if for all I = 1, 2,..., n and for every s i in S i, we have: u i(s i*, s {-i}) >= u i(s i, s-i) where s {-i}* signifies the strategies of all players other than I at the equilibrium. A Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one for each player, that ensures no player may enhance their payout by changing tactics.
