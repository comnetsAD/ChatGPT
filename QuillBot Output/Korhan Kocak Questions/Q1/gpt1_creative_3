Nash equilibria are the states of non-cooperative games in which all players have made the optimal choice of strategy given the other players' decisions. John Nash, a Nobel laureate in economics and mathematics, is credited with inventing the notion in his 1950 thesis. In a nutshell, a Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one for each participant in a game, where no individual can gain by altering their strategy unilaterally given the strategies of the other players. If there are N players in a game and each player, I has a set of strategies known as Si, then we may define the strategy profile as s = (s1, s2,..., sN), where si is the strategy selected by player i. If, for each player I and for each si in Si, we have: u(si*, sj*) >= u(si, sj*) for every j = 1, 2,..., N (where u(.) is the utility function), then the players' strategy profiles s* = (s1*, s2*,..., sN*) constitute a Nash equilibrium. Given that all other players maintain their current strategies (in this case, sj*), it implies that no player I can improve their position by switching from si* to any other strategy si in Si. That is, in a Nash equilibrium, no one is motivated to alter their game plan in light of the actions of the other players.
