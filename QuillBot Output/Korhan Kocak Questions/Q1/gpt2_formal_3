The Nash equilibrium is a notion in game theory that describes a situation in which each player in a game has selected the optimal strategy given the tactics selected by the other players. It is named after Nobel winner John Nash, whose 1950 thesis originally defined the notion. Formally, a Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one for each player, in which no player can increase their reward by unilaterally altering their strategy while the strategies of the other players stay unchanged. In other words, a collection of tactics is a Nash equilibrium if and only if, given the strategies of the other players, no player has an incentive to modify their strategy. Formally, let S i be the set of strategies accessible to player I in a game with n players, and let u i(s) be the payout to player I when the strategy profile is s = (s 1, s 2,..., s n). Then, a strategy profile s* = (s 1*, s 2*,..., s n*) is a Nash equilibrium if and only if, for every s i in S i and for all I = 1, 2,..., n, we have: u i(s i*, s -i) >= u i(s i, s -i), where s_ A Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can increase their payout by selecting a different strategy, given the strategies selected by the other players.
