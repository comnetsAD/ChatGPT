A situation in which each player in a game has selected the best strategy they can, given the tactics chosen by the other players, is known as the Nash equilibrium in game theory. It is named after John Nash, a Nobel Prize winner, who introduced the idea in his 1950 thesis. A Nash equilibrium is formally defined as a collection of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can increase their reward by unilaterally altering their strategy while the strategies of the other players stay the same. To put it another way, a collection of strategies is in a Nash equilibrium if and only if neither player is motivated to alter their approach in light of the approaches taken by the other players. More specifically, let S i be the set of strategies accessible to player I for a given game with n players, and let u i(s) be player i's reward when the strategy profile is s = (s 1, s 2,..., s n). Consequently, a strategy profile s* = (s 1*, s 2*,..., s n*) is a Nash equilibrium if and only if the following statement holds true for all I = 1, 2,..., n and all s i in S i: u i(s i*, s -i*) >= u i(s i, s -i*), where s -i A Nash equilibrium, to put it simply, is a collection of strategies, one for each player, whereby no player can increase their payout by selecting a different strategy given the strategies selected by the other players.
