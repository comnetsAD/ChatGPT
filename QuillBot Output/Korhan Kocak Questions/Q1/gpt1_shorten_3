In game theory, a Nash equilibrium occurs when each participant in a non-cooperative game has selected the optimum strategy given the tactics of the other players. In his 1950 thesis, Nobel Prize-winning economist and mathematician John Nash coined the term. A Nash equilibrium exists if no player can gain by unilaterally altering their strategy given the tactics of the other players. In a game with N participants, each player I has a set of feasible strategies Si. The strategy profile is s = (s1, s2,..., sN), where si is player i's strategy. A strategy profile s* = (s1*, s2*,..., sN*) is a Nash equilibrium if for every player I and every si in Si, we have: u(si*, sj*) >= u(si, sj*) for every j = 1, 2,..., N (where u(.) is the utility function). Given that the other players preserve their strategy sj*, no player I can acquire greater utility by altering their strategy si* to any other si in Si. Thus, in a Nash equilibrium, each player has no motivation to change strategy given the tactics of the other players.
