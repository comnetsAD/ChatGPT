In game theory, the Nash equilibrium is a solution concept for a non-cooperative game with two or more players in which each player is assumed to know the equilibrium tactics of the other players and no person gains anything by changing merely their own strategy. Given the strategies of the other players, a profile of strategies is a Nash equilibrium if no player can do better by unilaterally changing their strategy. In other words, a Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one for each player, such that no individual can improve their payout by altering their strategy while the other players maintain theirs. In other terms, a Nash equilibrium is a condition in which each player's optimal strategy is determined by the plans of the other players. Multiple Nash equilibria or none can exist in a game. Notably, the Nash equilibrium is a theoretical notion, and it is not guaranteed that real-world circumstances would attain a Nash equilibrium, as it is founded on the assumptions of rational conduct and comprehensive information.
