A Nash equilibrium is a state in game theory in which each player in a non-cooperative game has chosen the optimal strategy accessible to them, given the tactics chosen by the other players. John Nash, a Nobel Prize-winning economist and mathematician who initially formulated the notion in his 1950 thesis, is commemorated by the concept's name. Formally, a collection of strategies, one for each participant in a game, is a Nash equilibrium if, given the strategies of the other players, no player can benefit from unilaterally changing their strategy. Suppose there are N participants in a game, and each player I has a set of viable strategies Si. Let s = (s1, s2,..., sN) be the strategy profile, where si is the player i's selected strategy. A strategy profile s* = (s1*, s2*,..., sN*) is a Nash equilibrium if, for each player I and each si in Si, u(si*, sj*) >= u(si, sj*) for all j = 1, 2,..., N (where u(.) is the utility function) It means that no player I can increase their utility by changing their strategy si* to any other strategy si in Si, if all other players maintain their strategy sj*. In other words, in a Nash equilibrium, given the strategies of the other players, each player has no reason to change their approach.
