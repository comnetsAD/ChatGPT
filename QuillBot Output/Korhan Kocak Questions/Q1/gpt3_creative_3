The Nash equilibrium is a solution idea in game theory for a non-cooperative game with two or more players in which all players know the equilibrium tactics of the other players and no one player can gain by changing solely their own strategy. If, given the tactics of the other players, no player can improve their position by switching to a different strategy, then the resulting profile of strategies is a Nash equilibrium. A Nash equilibrium, in other terms, is a group of strategies where no one can enhance their payout by altering their approach while the other players maintain theirs. To rephrase, in a Nash equilibrium, all players' strategies are optimal in light of the other players' choices. There may be more than one Nash equilibrium in a game, or none at all. Since the Nash equilibrium assumes that all players are acting rationally and have access to all relevant information, it is only a theoretical concept and cannot be used to predict whether or not a particular circumstance would result in a Nash equilibrium in the real world.
