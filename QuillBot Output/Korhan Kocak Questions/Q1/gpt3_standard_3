The Nash equilibrium in game theory is a concept for a non-cooperative game with two or more players where each player is considered to be aware of the other players' equilibrium plans and where no player stands to gain by changing merely their own strategy. A Nash equilibrium exists when no player, given the strategies of the other players, can benefit from unilaterally changing their strategy. A Nash equilibrium, then, is a collection of strategies with one for each player such that no player can increase their payout by altering their strategy while the other players maintain their current strategies. A Nash equilibrium, then, is a situation in which every player's strategy is the best one possible given the tactics of the other players. There may be several Nash equilibria in a game or none at all. The Nash equilibrium is a theoretical idea, and as it relies on the presumptions of rational action and full information, it cannot be assumed that it will apply to real-world situations.
