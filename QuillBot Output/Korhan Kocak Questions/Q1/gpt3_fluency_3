The Nash equilibrium is a solution concept in game theory for a non-cooperative game with two or more players, in which each player is assumed to know the equilibrium strategies of the other players and no player has anything to gain by changing only their own strategy. Given the strategies of the other players, a profile of strategies is a Nash equilibrium if no player can do better by unilaterally changing their strategy. In other words, a Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player, in which no player's payoff can be improved by changing their strategy while the other players' strategies remain unchanged. A Nash equilibrium, in other words, is a state in which each player's strategy is optimal given the strategies of the other players. There can be multiple Nash equilibria in a game or none at all. It is important to note that the Nash equilibrium is a theoretical concept, and it is not guaranteed that real-world situations will reach a Nash equilibrium because it is based on rational behavior and complete information.
