In the field of game theory, an equilibrium is referred to as a "Nash state" when all of the participants in a competitive game have made decisions based on what they believe to be the optimal course of action for them given the decisions made by the other players. John Nash, an economist and mathematician who won the Nobel Prize and initially developed the notion in his 1950 thesis, was given the honor of having his name associated with the idea. Formally speaking, a Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one for each participant in a game. This occurs when no person can profit by unilaterally altering their strategy, given the strategies of the other players. Let's imagine we have a game with N participants, and each player I has a set of alternative strategies called Si. We'll define the strategy profile as s = (s1, s2,..., sN), where si is the strategy that player I selected to use in the game. If for every player I and for every si in Si we have: u(si*, sj*) >= u(si, sj*) for every j = 1, 2,..., N (where u(.) is the utility function), then we have a Nash equilibrium for the strategy profile s* = (s1*, s2*,..., sN*). It indicates that no player I can improve their position in the game by switching from their current strategy si* to any other strategy si in Si, provided that the other players maintain their current strategy sj*. To put it another way, in a Nash equilibrium, there is no motivation for any player to modify their strategy given the fact that the tactics of the other players have been taken into account.
