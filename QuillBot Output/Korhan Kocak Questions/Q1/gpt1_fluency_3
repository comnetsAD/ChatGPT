A Nash equilibrium is a state in game theory in which each player in a non-cooperative game has chosen the best strategy available to them in light of the strategies chosen by the other players. The concept is named after John Nash, a Nobel Laureate economist and mathematician who first proposed it in his 1950 thesis. Formally, a Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player in a game, where no player can benefit from unilaterally changing their strategy given the strategies of the other players. Let's say there are N players in a game, and each player I has a set of possible strategies Si. Let s = (s1, s2,..., sN) be the strategy profile, where si is the strategy chosen by player i. A Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile s* = (s1*, s2*,..., sN*) if for every player I and for every si in Si, we have: u(si*, sj*) >= u(si, sj*) for every j = 1, 2,..., N (where u(.) is the utility function). It means that no player I can gain more utility by switching from strategy si* to any other strategy si in Si, as long as the other players maintain their strategy sj*. In other words, given the strategies of the other players, each player has no incentive to change their strategy in a Nash equilibrium.
