The Nash equilibrium is a game theory concept that describes a situation in which each player in a game has selected the optimal strategy possible given the tactics chosen by the other players. It is named after John Nash, a Nobel winner who initially defined the notion in his 1950 thesis. A Nash equilibrium is formally defined as a collection of strategies, one for each player, in which no player can increase their reward by unilaterally altering their strategy while the other players' strategies stay constant. In other words, given the tactics of the other players, a set of strategies is a Nash equilibrium if and only if neither player has an incentive to modify their strategy. Let S i be the set of strategies accessible to player I in a given game with n players, and let u i(s) be the payout to player I when the strategy profile is s = (s 1, s 2,..., s n). Then, for all I = 1, 2,..., n and all s i in S i, we have: u i(s i*, s -i) >= u i(s i, s -i), where s -i* specifies the strategies of all players other than I at the equilibrium. A Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one for each player, such that no player's payout can be improved by adopting a different strategy given the strategies selected by the other players.
