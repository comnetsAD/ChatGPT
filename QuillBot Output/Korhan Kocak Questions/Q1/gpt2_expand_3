The Nash equilibrium is a notion in game theory that specifies a situation in which every player in a game has selected the best strategy they can, given the tactics chosen by the other players in the game. This state is said to be in a state of "game theory equilibrium." John Nash, winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, was the one who initially introduced the notion in his thesis back in 1950. Formally speaking, a Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one for each player, in which there is no way for any player to increase their reward by unilaterally altering their strategy while the strategies of the other players stay the same. To put it another way, a collection of strategies is said to be in a state of Nash equilibrium if and only if no player has any reason to modify their plan in light of the tactics used by the other players. In a more formal sense, for a given game with n players, let S i be the set of strategies that are accessible to player I and let u i(s) be the payout that is accrued to player I when the strategy profile is equal to (s 1, s 2,..., s n). Then, a strategy profile of the form s* = (s 1*, s 2*,..., s n*) is considered to be a Nash equilibrium if and only if the following statement is true for all I = 1, 2,..., n and for every s i in S i: u i(s i*, s -i) >= u i(s i, s - A Nash equilibrium, to put it more simply, is a collection of strategies, one for each player, which are designed in such a way that no person can increase their payout by selecting a different strategy given the strategies that have already been selected by the other players in the game.
