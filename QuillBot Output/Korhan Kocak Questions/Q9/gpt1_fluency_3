To identify the pure and mixed strategy Nash equilibria for the aforementioned games, we must first determine the appropriate reaction for each player for each strategy used by the other player. If player 2 plays strategy L (left column), player 1's optimal reaction is to play strategy U (1,1), which has a larger reward than strategies M (-2,-2) or D. (-2,-2) If player 2 uses strategy C (center column), player 1's optimal reaction is to use strategy U (-2,-2) since it has a greater reward than strategies M (1,-1) or D. (-1,1) If player 2 uses strategy R (right column), player 1's optimum reaction is to use strategy U (-2,-2) since it has a greater reward than strategies M (-1,1) or D. (1,-1) If player 1 plays strategy U (top row), player 2's optimal reaction is to play strategy L (1,1), which has a better reward than playing strategy C (-2,-2) or R. (-2,-2) If player 1 chooses strategy M (middle row), player 2 should choose strategy R (-1,1), which has a better reward than strategies L (-2,-2) or C. (1,-1) If player 1 plays strategy D (bottom row), player 2's best response is to play strategy R (1,-1) because it gives them a higher payoff than playing strategy L (-2,-2) or C (-1,1). To identify the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we must look for probability distributions across the strategies that result in no player being able to enhance their reward by switching strategies. We can see that if both players randomly choose a strategy with a chance of 1/3 for each approach, neither player has an incentive to stray from their mixed strategy since they are already earning the largest anticipated reward feasible given the other player's mixed strategy. In conclusion, there is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium in this game, but there is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium in which both players randomly choose their strategy with probability 1/3 for each strategy.
