Unadulterated tactic It is impossible for any player to increase their payout by changing their strategy while all other players' strategies remain unchanged in a Nash equilibrium. With a hybrid approach If all players maintain their current probability distributions, then the Nash equilibrium is a set of probability distributions across strategies where no player can increase their expected return by changing their own probability distribution. There are no Nash equilibria in this game where players are only considering their own optimal approach. The probability distributions of each player must be determined such that no player may increase their anticipated payoff by modifying their distribution in order to locate the Nash equilibria for the mixed strategies. If player U chooses to play the cards L, C, and R, below are the predicted payoffs: The expression for E(L) is: 1 * P(M, D) + (-2) * (1 - P(M, D)). Using the formula: E(C) = -2 * P(M, D) + -2 * (1 - P(M, D)), The formula for E(R) is: -2 * P(M, D) + -2 * (1 - P(M, D)). Using the inequality E(L) > E(C) = E(M), we may calculate P(M, D) (R). Thus, In other words, 1 * P(M, D) + (-2) * (1 - P(M, D)) > (-2) * P(M, D) + (-2) * (1 - P(M, D)). With some math, we can determine that P(M, D) = 1/3. The optimal reaction for Player U is to play L with a probability of 1/3, followed by C and R, each with a probability of 1/3. Similarily, If you're Player M, the optimal reaction is to play C with a probability of 1/2 and R with a probability of 1/2. With a 1/2 chance of playing C and a 1/2 chance of playing L, player D should respond by playing C and L, respectively. Consequently, the (1/3, 1/2, 1/2) Nash equilibrium for U, M, and D in this game. There is only one possible mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium in this game.
