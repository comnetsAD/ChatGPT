A straightforward method Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one for each player, in which no player can enhance their result by unilaterally altering their strategy while the other players' remain constant. A mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a probability distribution across pure strategies for each player such that no player can enhance their expected result by modifying their probability distribution while the other players' remains constant. Player 1 has three pure tactics (U, M, and D) in this game, whereas Player 2 has three pure strategies (L, C, and R). First, we'll look at pure strategy Nash equilibria. If player 1 picks U, player 2 has no strategy that guarantees a larger payout than L, hence (U, L) is a Nash equilibrium for pure strategies. If player 1 picks M, player 2 has no strategy that guarantees a better payout than C, hence (M, C) is a Nash equilibrium for pure strategies. If player 1 picks D, player 2 has no strategy that guarantees a better payout than R, hence (D, R) is a Nash equilibrium for pure strategies. We shall now look at the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Player 1 may give probability p, q, and r to strategies U, M, and D, while player 2 can assign probabilities x, y, and z to strategies L, C, and R. Player 1's anticipated payout from strategy U is p + (1-p-q-r), -2q -2(1-p-q-r), and -2r -2 from strategy D. (1-p-q-r) The predicted reward for Player 2 from strategy L is p + x(-2) + y(-2) + z(-2), -2p + x + y(-1) + z(-1) and -2p -2q + x(-2) + y + z(-1) (-1) We need the following for player 1 to have the best response: p + (1-p-q-r) >= -2q -2(1-p-q-r) >= -2r -2(1-p-q-r) >= -2r -2 (1-p-q-r) We need the following for player 2 to get the best response: p + x(-2) + y(-2) + z(-2) >= -2p + x + y(-1) + z(-1) >= -2p -2q + x(-2) + y + z(-1) >= -2p -2q + x(-2) + y + z(-1) (-1) We can get the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium by solving these inequalities and the restrictions p+q+r=1 and x+y+z=1. In summary, the game includes three pure strategy Nash equilibria (U, L), (M, C), and (D, R) and one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (p,q,r) = (1/3,1/3,1/3) and (x,y,z) = (1/3,1/3,1/3) where player 1 picks U, M, D with a probability of 1/3 and player 2 chooses L, C, R with a probability of 1/3.
