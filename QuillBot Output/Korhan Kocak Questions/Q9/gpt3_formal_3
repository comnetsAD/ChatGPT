A pure strategy The Nash equilibrium is a collection of tactics in which no player may increase their payout by altering their strategy while the other players' strategies remain unchanged. A mixed approach Nash equilibrium is a collection of probability distributions across strategies in which no player may increase their expected payoff by altering their probability distribution while the probability distributions of the other players remain unchanged. There are no pure strategy Nash equilibria for this game. To determine the Nash equilibria for mixed strategies, we must determine the probability distributions for each player such that no player may increase their expected payoff by altering their distribution. The estimated payoffs for L, C, and R for player U are: E(L) = 1 * P(M, D) + (-2) * (1 - P(M, D)) (-2) * P(M, D) + (-2) * (1 - P(M, D) = E(C). E(R) = (-2) * P(M, D) + (-2) * (1 - P(M, D)) To get P(M, D), we can take advantage of the fact that E(L) > E(C) = E (R). Thus, 1 * P(M, D) + (-2) * (1 - P(M, D)) > (-2) * P(M, D) + (-2) * (1 - P(M, D)) The solution for P(M, D) is P(M, D) = 1/3. The optimal response for Player U is to play L with a probability of 1/3 and C and R with probabilities of 1/3 each. Similarily, The optimal answer for Player M is to play C with a probability of 1/2 and R with a probability of 1/2. The optimal answer for Player D is to play C with a probability of 1/2 and L with a probability of 1/2. The mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is therefore (1/3, 1/2, 1/2) for U, M, and D, respectively. There is just one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium in this game.
