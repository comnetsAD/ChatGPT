A pure strategy The Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can enhance their result by changing their approach unilaterally while the other players maintain theirs. A mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a probability distribution across pure strategies for each player such that no player may enhance their expected result by altering their probability distribution while the other players maintain their fixed probability distributions. Player 1 has three pure tactics U, M, and D in this game, whereas player 2 has three pure strategies L, C, and R. First, we'll examine the pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Player 2 has no strategy that ensures a better payout than L if player 1 picks U, hence (U, L) is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Player 2 has no strategy that ensures a larger payout than C if player 1 picks M, hence (M, C) is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Player 2 has no strategy that ensures a larger payout than R if player 1 picks D, hence (D, R) is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Now, we will explore the Nash equilibrium for mixed strategies. Player 1 may give probability p, q, and r to the strategies U, M, and D, while player 2 can assign probabilities x, y, and z to the strategies L, C, and R. Player 1 may anticipate p + (1-p-q-r) from strategy U, -2q -2(1-p-q-r) from strategy M, and -2r -2 from strategy D. (1-p-q-r) The predicted reward from strategy L for Player 2 is p + x(-2) + y(-2) + z(-2), from strategy C it is -2p + x + y(-1) + z(-1), and from strategy R it is -2p -2q + x(-2) + y + z(-2) (-1) For player 1 to have the optimal reaction, we require: p + (1-p-q-r) >= -2q -2(1-p-q-r) >= -2r -2 (1-p-q-r) For player 2 to have the optimal answer, we require: p + x(-2) + y(-2) + z(-2) >= -2p + x + y(-1) + z(-1) >= -2p -2q + x(-2) + y + z (-1) Solving these inequalities and satisfying the constraints p+q+r=1 and x+y+z=1, we can determine that the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (p,q,r) = (1/3,1/3,1/3) and (x,y,z) = (1/3,1/3,1/3) The game features three pure strategy Nash equilibria (U, L), (M, C), and (D, R) and one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (p,q,r) = (1/3,1/3,1/3) and (x,y,z) = (1/3,1/3,1/3) where player 1 picks U, M, D with a probability of 1/3 and player 2 chooses L, C, R with a probability of 1/3.
