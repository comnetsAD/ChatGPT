A simple tactic In a Nash equilibrium, no player can increase their payout by altering their strategy while the other players' strategies stay the same. mixed tactics In a Nash equilibrium, no player can increase their expected payout by altering their probability distribution while the probability distributions of the other players stay constant. There are no Nash equilibria with pure strategy for this game. Finding the probability distributions for each player such that no player may increase their anticipated return by modifying their distribution is necessary to locate the mixed strategy Nash equilibria. The projected benefits for playing L, C, and R for player U are: E(L) is equal to 1 * P(M, D) plus (-2) * (1 - P(M, D) E(C) is equal to (-2)* P(M, D) plus (-2)* (1 - P(M, D)). E(R) is equal to (-2)*P(M, D) plus (-2)*(1 - P(M, D)). We can use the knowledge that E(L) > E(C) = E to obtain P(M, D) (R). Thus, P(M, D) = 1 * P(M, D) + (-2) * (1 - P(M, D)) > P(M, D) = (-2) * P(M, D) + (-2) * (1 - P(M, D)) The result of computing P(M, D) is P(M, D) = 1/3. The optimal move for Player U is to play L with a probability of 1/3, followed by C and R with a probability of 1/3 each. Similarily, Playing C with probability 1/2 and R with probability 1/2 is Player M's best move. The optimum move for Player D is to play C and L, both with probability 1/2. Therefore, for U, M, and D, respectively, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is (1/3, 1/2, 1/2). There is just one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium in this game.
