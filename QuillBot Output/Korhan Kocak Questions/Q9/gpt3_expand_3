A pure strategy A collection of strategies is said to be in a state of Nash equilibrium when no player can increase their payout by changing their strategy while the strategies of the other players stay unchanged. A tactic consisting of both The Nash equilibrium is a collection of probability distributions across strategies in which no player can increase their expected payoff by modifying their own probability distribution while the probability distributions of the other players stay unchanged. There are no Nash equilibria that can be reached using a purely strategic approach in this game. In order to identify the Nash equilibria for mixed strategies, we need to find the probability distributions for each player in such a way that it is impossible for any player to enhance their expected reward by making a change to their distribution. The following are player U's predicted payoffs for playing the cards L, C, and R: E(L) = 1 * P(M, D) + (-2) * (1 - P(M, D)) E(C) equals minus two times P(M, D) plus minus two times P(M, D) minus one. E(R) = (-2) * P(M, D) + (-2) * (1 - P(M, D)) We can use the fact that E(L) > E(C) = E to find out what the value of P(M, D) is (R). Thus, 1 * P(M, D) + (-2) * (1 - P(M, D)) > (-2) * P(M, D) + (-2) * (1 - P(M, D)) Solving for P(M, D) gives P(M, D) = 1/3. The optimal reaction for Player U is to play L with a probability of 1/3, followed by C and R, both with probabilities of 1/3. Similarily, The most effective reaction for Player M is to play C with a probability of half and R with the same probability. The most effective reaction for Player D is to play C with a probability of half and L with a probability of half. As a result, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is composed of the values 1/3, 1/2, and 1/2 for U, M, and D correspondingly. There is just one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium that can be reached in this game.
