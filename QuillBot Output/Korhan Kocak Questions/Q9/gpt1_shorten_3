To discover the pure and mixed strategy Nash equilibria for the aforementioned games, we must first identify the optimum response for each player for each strategy of the other player. For player 1 (top row): If player 2 plays strategy L (left column), player 1's optimal response is strategy U (1,1), which pays more than strategy M (-2,-2) or D. (-2,-2) If player 2 plays strategy C (center column), player 1's optimal answer is strategy U (-2,-2) since it pays more than M (1,-1) or D. (-1,1) If player 2 plays strategy R (right column), player 1's optimum answer is strategy U (-2,-2) since it pays more than strategy M (-1,1) or D. (1,-1) For player 2 (bottom row): If player 1 plays strategy U (top row), player 2's optimum response is strategy L (1,1), which pays more than strategy C (-2,-2) or R. (-2,-2) Player 2's optimum reaction to strategy M (middle row) is strategy R (-1,1), which pays off more than strategy L (-2,-2) or C. (1,-1) If player 1 plays strategy D (bottom row), player 2's best response is to play strategy R (1,-1) because it gives them a higher payoff than playing strategy L (-2,-2) or C (-1,1). This shows that there is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium in this game because if player 1 plays strategy U, player 2 will play strategy L, but if player 1 plays M, player 2 will play R, and if player 1 plays D, player 2 will play R. To determine the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we must search for probability distributions across strategies that prevent players from improving their reward by switching strategies. If both players randomize their approach with probability 1/3 for each plan, neither player has an incentive to depart from their mixed strategy since they are already earning the greatest predicted payout given the other player's mixed strategy. In conclusion, this game has a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium where both players randomly choose their approach with 1/3 probability.
