Finding the optimum reaction for each player to each strategy of the other player is the first step in determining the pure and mixed strategy Nash equilibria for the given games. The optimum move for player 1 (top row) in response to player 2 using strategy L (left column) is to use strategy U (1,1) since it offers a bigger reward than using strategy M (-2,-2) or D. (-2,-2) The optimum move for player 1 in response to player 2 using strategy C (middle column) is to use strategy U (-2, -2), which has a larger reward than using strategy M (1, -1), or D. (-1,1) The optimum course of action for player 1 in response to player 2 using strategy R (right column) is to use strategy U (-2,-2) since it offers a better return than using strategy M (-1,1) or D. (1,-1) If player 1 uses strategy U (top row), player 2 (bottom row) should use strategy L (1,1) since it offers a better return than using strategy C (-2,-2) or R. (-2,-2) Player 2's best move in response to Player 1 playing Strategy M (middle row) is to play Strategy R (-1,1) since it offers them a better reward than playing Strategy L (-2,-2) or C. (1,-1) From this, we can see that there is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium in this game because if player 1 plays strategy U, player 2 will play strategy L, but if player 1 plays strategy M, player 2 will play strategy R, and if player 1 plays strategy D, player 2 will play strategy R. This means that if player 1 plays strategy D (bottom row), player 2's best response is to play strategy R (1,-1) as it gives them a higher payoff than playing strategy L (-2,-2) We must look for any probability distributions across the strategies that prevent any player from increasing their payout by using a different strategy in order to identify the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. We can see that neither player has an incentive to stray from their mixed strategy since they are already earning the largest anticipated reward feasible given the other player's mixed strategy if both players randomize their strategies with probability 1/3 for each strategy. In conclusion, this game lacks a pure strategy Nash equilibrium but does have a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium in which each player randomly chooses a strategy with a chance of 1/3.
