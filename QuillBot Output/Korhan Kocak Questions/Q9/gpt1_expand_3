To begin the process of determining the pure strategy and mixed strategy Nash equilibria for the provided games, we must first determine the optimal reaction for each player to the strategies used by the other players. If player 2 plays strategy L (left column), then the optimum answer for player 1 (top row) is to play strategy U (1,1) since it provides them a better return than playing strategy M (-2,-2) or D. If player 2 plays strategy L (left column), then player 1's best reaction is to play strategy U (1,1) (-2,-2) If player 2 plays strategy C (center column), the optimum answer for player 1 is to play strategy U (-2,-2) since it provides them a larger return than playing strategy M (1,-1) or D. If player 2 plays strategy C (center column), player 1's best reaction is to play strategy U (-2,-2). (-1,1) If player 2 chooses strategy R (right column), player 1's best reaction is to play strategy U (-2,-2) since it provides them a larger return than playing strategy M (-1,1) or D. If player 2 chooses strategy R (right column), player 1's best response is to play strategy U (-2,-2). (1,-1) If player 1 uses strategy U (top row), the optimum answer for player 2 (bottom row) is to play strategy L (1,1) since it provides them a better return than playing strategy C (-2,-2) or R. If player 1 uses strategy U (top row), player 2's best reaction is to play strategy L (1,1) (-2,-2) If player 1 plays strategy M (middle row), then player 2 should respond by playing strategy R (-1,1) since it provides them a better return than playing strategy L (-2,-2) or C. If player 1 plays strategy M (middle row), then player 2 should play strategy R (-1,1). (1,-1) Because of this, we can see that there is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium in this game because if player 1 plays strategy U, player 2 will play strategy L, but if player 1 plays strategy M, player 2 will play strategy R, and if player 1 plays strategy D, player 2 will play strategy R. If player 1 plays strategy D (bottom row), player 2's best response is to play strategy R (1,-1) as it gives them a higher payoff than playing strategy L (-2,-2) or C ( In order to locate the Nash equilibrium for mixed strategies, we need to check for any probability distributions over the strategies that result in no player being able to improve their payoff by selecting a different strategy. If we find such a distribution, we will have found the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. We can see that if both players randomize their strategy with a probability of one third for each strategy, then neither player has an incentive to deviate from their mixed strategy because they are already receiving the highest expected payoff possible given the other player's mixed strategy. This is the case because they are already receiving the highest expected payoff possible given the other player's mixed strategy. In conclusion, a pure strategy Nash equilibrium does not exist in this game; however, a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium does exist, in which both players randomly choose their strategy with a chance of one third for each strategy.
