A straightforward strategy Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies in which no player's payoff can be improved by changing their strategy while the other players' strategies remain constant. A hybrid strategy Nash equilibrium is a set of probability distributions over strategies in which no player can improve their expected payoff by changing their probability distribution while the probability distributions of the other players remain constant. There are no pure strategy Nash equilibria in this game. To find the mixed strategy Nash equilibria, we must first find the probability distributions for each player such that no player's expected payoff can be improved by changing their distribution. The expected payoffs for playing L, C, and R for player U are as follows: E(L) = 1 * P(M, D) + (1 - P(M, D)) (-2) * P(M, D) + (-2) * (1 - P(M, D)) = E(C). E(R) = (-2) P(M, D) + (-2) P(M, D) - (1 - P(M, D)) We can use the fact that E(L) > E(C) = E to find P(M, D) (R). Thus, 1 * P(M, D) + (-2) * (1 - P(M, D)) > (-2) * P(M, D) + (-2) * (1 - P(M, D)) > (-2) * P(M, D) + (-2) * (1 - P(M, D)) P(M, D) = 1/3 when P(M, D) is solved. The best response for Player U is to play L with a probability of 1/3 and C and R with a probability of 1/3 each. Similarily, The best response for Player M is to play C with probability 1/2 and R with probability 1/2. The best response for Player D is to play C with probability 1/2 and L with probability 1/2. As a result, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is (1/3, 1/2, 1/2) for U, M, and D. There is only one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium in this game.
