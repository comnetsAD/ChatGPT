Pure strategy Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one for each participant, where no player can better their result by unilaterally altering their strategy while the others retain theirs. A mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a probability distribution across pure strategies for each player. No player can enhance their anticipated result by altering their probability distribution while the others maintain theirs unchanged. Player 1 uses U, M, and D, while player 2 uses L, C, and R. First, the pure strategy Nash equilibria. Player 2 cannot promise a better payout than L if player 1 picks U, hence (U, L) is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Player 2 cannot promise a larger payout than C if player 1 picks M, hence (M, C) is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Player 2 cannot promise a larger payout than R if player 1 picks D, hence (D, R) is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. The mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is next. Player 1 assigns probability p, q, and r to strategy U, M, and D, whereas player 2 assigns x, y, and z to strategy L, C, and R. Player 1's anticipated payoff from strategy U is p + (1-p-q-r), from M is -2q -2(1-p-q-r), and from D is -2r -2. (1-p-q-r) Player 2's anticipated payoff from strategy L is p + x(-2) + y(-2) + z(-2), from strategy C is -2p + x + y(-1), and from strategy R is -2p -2q + x(-2) + y + z. (-1) We need: p + (1-p-q-r) >= -2q -2 = -2r (1-p-q-r) We need: p + x(-2) + y(-2) + z(-2) >= -2p -2q + x(-2) + y + z (-1) The mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (p,q,r) = (1/3,1/3,1/3) and (x,y,z) = (1/3,1/3,1/3). In summary, the game includes three pure strategy Nash equilibria (U, L), (M, C), and (D, R) and one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (p,q,r) = (1/3,1/3,1/3) and (x,y,z) = (1/3,1/3,1/3) where player 1 picks U, M, D with probability 1/3 and player 2 chooses L, C, R with probability 1/3.
