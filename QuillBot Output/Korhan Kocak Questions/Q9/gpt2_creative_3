Direct tactic Nash equilibrium refers to a collection of tactics where no player can better their result by altering their approach unilaterally while the other players maintain theirs unchanged. A Nash equilibrium with mixed strategies occurs when no player can enhance their anticipated result by modifying their probability distribution while the other players maintain theirs unchanged. Each participant in this game has access to three distinct pure strategies: U, M, and D for Player 1, and L, C, and R for Player 2. As a starting point, we'll think about Nash equilibria based on purely strategic play. A pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (U, L) if player 1 selects U and player 2 has no strategy that guarantees a greater payout than L. The (M, C) Nash equilibrium is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium because if player 1 picks M, player 2 has no strategy that guarantees a better payout than C. (D, R) is a pure strategy Nash equilibrium because if player 1 choose D, player 2 has no strategy that would guarantee a better reward than R. The Nash equilibrium for a game with several strategies is next up for analysis. The first player may give the strategies U, M, and D probability p, q, and r, while the second player can do the same for L, C, and R. If Player 1 chooses Strategy U, their anticipated payment is p + (1-p-q-r), if they choose Strategy M their expected payoff is -2q -2(1-p-q-r), and if they choose Strategy D their expected payoff is -2r -2. (1-p-q-r) The anticipated value of the game for Player 2 using Strategy L is p + x(-2) + y(-2) + z(-2); using Strategy C, it is -2p + x + y(-1) + z(-1); using Strategy R, it is -2p -2q + x(-2) + y + z(-2) (-1) The optimal answer from player 1 requires the following elements: Assume that p + (1-p-q-r) >= -2q -2(1-p-q-r) >= -2r -2. (1-p-q-r) In order for player 2 to provide the optimal answer, we must have: An example of this might be: p + x(-2) + y(-2) + z(-2) >= -2p + x + y + z(-1) >= -2p -2q + x(-2) + y + z(-1) (-1) In the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, (p,q,r) = (1/3,1/3,1/3) and (x,y,z) = (1/3,1/3,1/3) due to the solution of the aforementioned inequalities and the constraints (p+q+r=1) and (x+y+z=1). A total of four Nash equilibria are possible in this game: one with pure strategies (U, L), one with (M, C), and one with mixed strategies (p,q,r) = (1/3,1/3,1/3) and (x,y,z) = (1/3,1/3,1/3), where Player 1 chooses U, M, D with a probability of 1/3, and Player 2 chooses L, C, R with a probability of 1/3.
