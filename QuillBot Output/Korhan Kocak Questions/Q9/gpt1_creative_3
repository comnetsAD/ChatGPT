It is necessary to determine the optimal response of each player to each of the opponent's strategies before determining the pure and mixed strategy Nash equilibria for the provided games. If player 2 (bottom row) uses strategy L (left column), then player 1 (top row) should respond with U (1,1) rather than M (-2,-2) or D (both of which result in lower payoffs) (-2,-2) Strategy U (-2,-2) is the optimum answer for Player 1 if Player 2 plays Strategy C (center column) since it yields a bigger reward than Strategy M (1,-1) or D. (-1,1) Strategy U (-2,-2) is the optimum answer for Player 1 if Player 2 plays Strategy R (right column) because it yields a bigger reward than Strategy M (-1,1) or Strategy D (0-0). (1,-1) Specifically, if player 1 (top row) chooses move U, then player 2 (bottom row) should respond with move L (1,1) rather than moves C (-2,-2) or R (R has the highest reward of the three) (-2,-2) Players 2 and 3 should respond to player 1's plan M (middle row) with strategies R (-1,1) and C (-2,-2) respectively (1,-1) Because if player 1 plays strategy U, then player 2 will play strategy L, but if player 1 plays strategy M, then player 2 will play strategy R, then there is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium in this game. For the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium to be reached, we must first ensure that there is no probability distribution across the strategies such that any player may enhance their reward by switching strategies. Given that each player is earning the maximum anticipated payout feasible given the other player's mixed strategy, it is clear that if both players randomly choose their approach with a chance of 1/3 for each option, then neither player has an incentive to depart from their mixed strategy. In conclusion, the game does not have a pure strategy Nash equilibrium, but a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium does exist, with the chance of each player's strategy being 1/3.
