A simple tactic A collection of tactics known as a Nash equilibrium exists when no player can enhance their results by unilaterally altering their approach while the others maintain their fixed strategy. In a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, no player may increase their anticipated result by altering their probability distribution while the other players' probability distributions remain constant. Players 1 and 2 each have three pure tactics in this gameâ€”U, M, and D for player 1 and L, C, and R for player 2. We will start by thinking about the Nash equilibria for pure strategies. Player 2 cannot pick a strategy that ensures a better payout than L if Player 1 chooses U, making (U, L) a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Player 2 cannot pick a strategy that ensures a better reward than C if player 1 chooses M, making (M, C) a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Player 2 cannot pick a strategy that ensures a larger payout than R if player 1 chooses D, making (D, R) a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. We shall now talk about the Nash equilibrium for a mixed strategy. Player 1 may provide strategy U, M, and D probability p, q, and r, respectively, while Player 2 can give L, C, and R probabilities x, y, and z. The anticipated reward for Player 1 using strategies U is p + (1-p-q-r), M is -2q -2(1-p-q-r), and D is -2r -2. (1-p-q-r) Player 2's anticipated payoff for the strategies L and C is p + x(-2) + y(-2) + z(-2), -2p + x(-1) + y(-1) + z(-1), and -2p -2q + x(-2) + y + z(-2) (-1) Player 1 will respond best if we have everything we need for: P + (1-PQR) >= -2Q -2(1PQR) >= -2R -2 (1-p-q-r) Player 2 will respond best if we have everything we need for: The expression p + x(-2) + y(-2) + z(-2) >= -2p + x(-1) + y(-1) + z(-2) >= -2p -2q + x(-2) + y + z (-1) We can determine that the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (p,q,r) = (1/3,1/3,1/3) and (x,y,z) = (1/3,1/3,1/3) by solving these inequalities and the constraints p+q+r=1 and x+y+z=1. The game has three pure strategy Nash equilibria (U, L), (M, C), and (D, R), as well as one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (p, q, and r) = (1/3,1/3,1/3) and (x,y, and z) = (1/3,1/3,1/3), where player 1 selects U, M, and D with probability 1/3 each, and player 2 selects L, C, and R with probability 1/3 each.
