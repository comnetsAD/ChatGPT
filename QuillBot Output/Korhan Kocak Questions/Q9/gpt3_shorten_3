Pure strategy No player can enhance their payoff by changing their strategy while the other players' strategies remain fixed in Nash equilibrium. Mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a set of probability distributions across strategies where no actor can increase their expected return by modifying their probability distribution while the others' remain fixed. This game lacks pure strategy Nash equilibria. We require probability distributions for each player such that no player can increase their anticipated payoff by modifying their distribution to locate the mixed strategy Nash equilibria. Playing L, C, and R for player U yields: E(L) = 1 * P(M, D) + (-2) * (1-P(M, D)). E(C) = (-2)*P(M, D) + (-2)*(1 - P(M, D)). E(R) = (-2)*P(M, D) + (-2)*(1 - P(M, D)). We can utilize E(L) > E(C) = E to obtain P(M, D) (R). Thus, 1 * P(M, D) + (-2) * (1 - P(M, D)) > (-2) * P(M,D). Solving P(M, D) yields 1/3. Player U should play L 1/3, C 1/3, and R 1/3. Similarily, M should play C and R with probability 1/2. D should play C and L with probability 1/2. For U, M, and D, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (1/3, 1/2, 1/2). This game has one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium.
