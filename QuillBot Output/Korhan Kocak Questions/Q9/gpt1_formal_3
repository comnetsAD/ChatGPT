To determine the pure and mixed strategy Nash equilibria for the aforementioned games, we must first determine the optimal response of each player to each of the opponent's strategies. For player 1 (top row), the optimal response to player 2's strategy L (left column) is strategy U (1,1), since it yields a better reward than strategies M (-2,-2) or D. (-2,-2) If player 2 chooses strategy C (middle column), the optimal answer for player 1 is strategy U (-2,-2) since it yields a greater reward than strategies M (1,-1) or D. (-1,1) If player 2 chooses strategy R (right column), the optimal answer for player 1 is strategy U (-2,-2) since it yields a greater reward than strategies M (-1,1) or D. (1,-1) If player 1 (top row) plays strategy U, the optimal response for player 2 (bottom row) is to play strategy L (1,1), since it yields a bigger reward than strategies C (-2,-2) or R. (-2,-2) If player 1 chooses strategy M (middle row), the optimal answer for player 2 is strategy R (-1,1), since it yields a greater reward than strategies L (-2,-2) or C. (1,-1) If player 1 plays strategy D (bottom row), player 2's optimal response is to play strategy R (1,-1) as it provides a higher payoff than playing strategy L (-2,-2) or C (-1,1). This demonstrates that there is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium in this game, as if player 1 plays strategy U, player 2 will play strategy L, but if player 1 plays strategy M, player 2 will play strategy R. To determine the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, it is necessary to search for probability distributions across the strategies such that no player can enhance their reward by selecting a different strategy. We can see that if both players randomize their strategies with a chance of one-third for each approach, neither player has an incentive to stray from their mixed strategy since they are already earning the maximum predicted return given the other player's mixed strategy. In conclusion, there is no pure strategy Nash equilibrium in this game, but there is a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium in which both players randomly choose one of two strategies with a chance of one-third.
