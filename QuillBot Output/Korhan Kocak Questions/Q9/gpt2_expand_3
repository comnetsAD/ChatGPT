A pure strategy Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one for each player, such that no player can enhance their result by unilaterally altering their approach while the other players keep theirs constant. This is because each person's strategy is unique to them, and the other players' strategies are fixed. A mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a probability distribution over pure strategies for each player, such that no player can improve their expected outcome by changing their probability distribution while the other players keep theirs fixed. In other words, a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a situation in which no player can improve their expected outcome by changing their probability distribution. Player 1 has access to three pure tactics in this game, namely U, M, and D, whereas Player 2 has access to three pure strategies, namely L, C, and R. First, we are going to look at the Nash equilibria for the pure strategy. In the event that player 1 selects U, player 2 does not have a strategy that can guarantee a larger reward than L; hence, the state of (U, L) represents a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. (M, C) is an example of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium since player 2 has no other strategy that can guarantee a greater reward than C if player 1 picks M as their strategy. In the event that player 1 picks D, player 2 does not have a strategy that can guarantee a larger reward than R; hence, (D, R) is an example of a pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Now that we have that out of the way, let's talk about the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Player 1 is able to ascribe probability p, q, and r, respectively, to the strategies U, M, and D, while Player 2 is able to ascribe probabilities x, y, and z, respectively, to the strategies L, C, and R. The anticipated reward for Player 1's strategy U is p + (1-p-q-r), whereas the expected payoff for Player 1's strategy M is -2q -2(1-p-q-r), and the expected payoff for Player 1's strategy D is -2r -2. (1-p-q-r) The projected return for Player 2 using Strategy L is p + x(-2) + y(-2) + z(-2), whereas using Strategy C results in a return of -2p + x + y(-1) + z(-1), and using Strategy R results in a return of -2p -2q + x(-2) + y + z. (-1) In order to have the best possible reaction to player 1, we need to have: p + (1-p-q-r) >= -2q -2(1-p-q-r) >= -2r -2 (1-p-q-r) In order to ensure that player 2 has the best possible reaction, we need to have: p + x(-2) + y(-2) + z(-2) >= -2p + x + y(-1) + z(-1) >= -2p -2q + x(-2) + y + z (-1) After solving these inequalities and taking into account the restrictions p+q+r=1 and x+y+z=1, we are able to determine that the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (p,q,r) = (1/3,1/3,1/3) and (x,y,z) = (1/3,1/3,1/3) respectively. In a nutshell, the game has three pure strategy Nash equilibria (U, L), (M, C) and (D, R) and one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium (p,q,r) = (1/3,1/3,1/3) and (x,y,z) = (1/3,1/3,1/3) where player 1 chooses U, M, D with a probability of 1/3 for each, and player 2 chooses L, C, R with a probability of 1/3 for each
