This game can be modeled as a strategic form game, with two strategies for each player (Colonel Blotto and the rebel group) (deploying their troops to Pass 1 or Pass 2). The payoff matrix is illustrated below: Pass 1 (Colonel Blotto) Pass 2 (Colonel Blotto) (Colonel Blotto) -1, -1 1, -1 (Rebel Group) Pass number two (Rebel Group): -1, 1 1, 1 To find the Nash equilibria, we must first identify the strategies in which neither player has an incentive to deviate from their chosen strategy given the strategy of the other player. Colonel Blotto's best response if the rebels deploy their troops to Pass 1 is to deploy his troops to Pass 2. (1, -1) Colonel Blotto's best response if the rebels deploy their troops to Pass 2 is to deploy his troops to Pass 1. (-1, 1) If Colonel Blotto deploys his troops to Pass 1, the rebels' best response is to deploy their troops to Pass 2. (1, -1) If Colonel Blotto sends his troops to Pass 2, the rebels' best option is to send their troops to Pass 1. (-1, 1) We can see from this that there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria in this game: (Pass 1, Pass 2) and (Pass 2, Pass 1), in which Colonel Blotto deploys his troops to Pass 1 and the rebel group deploys their troops to Pass 2, and vice versa. There is also a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium in which both players randomize their strategy with probability 1/2. Colonel Blotto, for example, plays Pass 1 with a probability of 1/2 and Pass 2 with a probability of 1/2, and the rebel group also plays Pass 1 with a probability of 1/2 and Pass 2 with a probability of 1/2. In this case, neither player has an incentive to deviate from their mixed strategy because they are already receiving the maximum expected payoff possible based on the other player's mixed strategy. It is worth noting that the pure strategy Nash equilibria in this game are not Pareto efficient, as both players would be better off deploying their troops to the same pass, resulting in a draw. However, this is not a Nash equilibrium because one player has an incentive to deviate in order to win. To summarize, there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria (Pass 1, Pass 2) and (Pass 2, Pass 1), as well as one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium in which both players randomly choose their strategy with probability 1/2.
