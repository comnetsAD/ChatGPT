There are two possible participants in this game: Colonel Blotto and the rebel group. The game might be described as a strategic form game. The players each have a choice between two different strategies: they may either send one regiment to each mountain pass or send two regiments to a single mountain pass. The following is a list of the payoffs for each player: Colonel Blotto: 1 regiment to each pass Colonel Blotto: 2 regiments to one pass The Rebel Group will send one regiment through each pass (1,1). (-1,-1) Two regiments to one pass (-1,-1) granted to the rebel group (1,1) The Nash equilibrium in a game is a combination of strategies in which neither player can enhance their payout by changing their approach while the other player's strategy stays unaltered. This is the case when both players' strategies are held constant. In this particular scenario, there are two different Nash equilibria: (Colonel Blotto: 1 regiment to each pass, Rebel Group: 1 regiment to each pass), where each player receives a payment of 1 regiment for each pass. (Colonel Blotto: Two regiments for one pass; Rebel Group: Two regiments for one pass), whereby each player receives a payment of one In the initial equilibrium, each player sends one regiment to each mountain pass. This ensures that the insurgent group will never be victorious in any of the mountain passes, and that Colonel Blotto will emerge victorious from the conflict. Because each player brings two regiments to one pass in the second equilibria, there is no possibility for either side to win because the game will always end in a draw regardless of what happens. These two methods are the Nash equilibria of the game since no player can improve their position by switching strategies in any of the two scenarios.
