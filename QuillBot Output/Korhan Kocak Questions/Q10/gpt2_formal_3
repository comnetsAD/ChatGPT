This game may be represented as a two-player strategic form game: Colonel Blotto and the rebel group. Each player has the option of deploying one regiment to each mountain pass or two regiments to a single mountain pass. The following are each player's payouts: Colonel Blotto: 1 regiment to each pass Colonel Blotto: 2 regiments to one pass 1 regiment to each pass for the Rebel Group (1,1) (-1,-1) Rebel Group: Two regiments to a single pass (-1,-1) (1,1) The Nash equilibrium in a game is a combination of strategies in which neither party can enhance their payout by altering their approach while the other player's strategy stays constant. In this instance, two Nash equilibria exist: (Colonel Blotto: 1 regiment each pass; Rebel Group: 1 regiment per pass) where each player receives a payout of 1 regiment every pass. (Colonel Blotto: Two regiments to one pass; Rebel Group: Two regiments to one pass) where each player receives a payout of one. In the first equilibrium, each player sends one regiment to each mountain pass, so that the rebels cannot win anywhere and Colonel Blotto will not be defeated. In the second equilibrium, each side deploys two regiments to a single pass, resulting in a tie between both players. These tactics are the Nash equilibria of the game since no player can profit by altering their strategy.
