Colonel Blotto and the rebels have two strategies in this strategic form game (deploying their troops to Pass 1 or Pass 2). Payoff matrix: Passes 1 (Colonel Blotto) 2 (Colonel Blotto) Pass 1 (Rebel Group) -1. Pass 2 (Rebel Group) -1, 1, 1. The Nash equilibria are strategies where neither player has an incentive to depart from their chosen strategy given the other player's approach. For Colonel Blotto: If the rebels attack Pass 1, he should attack Pass 2. (1, -1) If the rebels take Pass 2, Colonel Blotto should take Pass 1. (-1, 1) If Colonel Blotto sends his forces to Pass 1, the rebels should send theirs to Pass 2. (1, -1) The rebel group should deploy to Pass 1 if Colonel Blotto deploys to Pass 2. (-1, 1) This shows that this game has two pure strategy Nash equilibria: (Pass 1, Pass 2) and (Pass 2, Pass 1), where Colonel Blotto deploys his forces to Pass 1 and the rebel group to Pass 2, and vice versa. Both players randomize their strategy with probability 1/2 in a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Colonel Blotto and the rebel group play Pass 1 and Pass 2 with probability 1/2. Since the opposing player's mixed strategy gives them the largest predicted payout, neither player has an incentive to depart. In this game, the pure strategy Nash equilibria are not Pareto efficient since both parties would benefit from deploying their soldiers to the same pass, ending in a draw. This is not a Nash equilibrium since one person has an incentive to deviate and win. In summary, there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria (Pass 1, Pass 2) and (Pass 2, Pass 1) and one mixed strategy equilibrium where both players randomize their approach with probability 1/2.
