For modeling purposes, Colonel Blotto and the rebel squad may be seen as two players in a strategic form game. A player may either send one regiment to each mountain pass, or they can send two regiments to one mountain pass. Here are the payouts for the various participants: One regiment per flank, Colonel Blotto Two units, one pass, Colonel Blotto One regiment from the insurgent force per corridor (1,1) (-1,-1) 2 regiments of rebels after every 1 pass (-1,-1) (1,1) The Nash equilibrium in a game is the set of strategies where both players are equally well off regardless of their own choices and where neither player can gain an advantage over the other by changing strategies while the other player maintains his or her own. There are two Nash equilibria here: Both Colonel Blotto and the Rebel Group are paid out at a rate of 1 regiment for every pass. Each player receives a 1 to 2 payment (Colonel Blotto: 2 regiments to 1 pass, Rebel Group: 2 regiments to 1 pass). If the rebels deploy one regiment to each mountain pass, then Colonel Blotto will not lose the fight and the initial equilibrium will hold. In the second equilibrium, both players send two regiments through a single pass, guaranteeing a draw regardless of who initiates the combat. These two tactics are the Nash equilibria of the game since neither player can win by switching to a different one.
