This game can be characterized as a strategic form game in which each participant has two strategies (Colonel Blotto and the rebel group) (deploying their troops to Pass 1 or Pass 2). This is how the payout matrix can be represented: Pass 1 (Colonel Blotto) Pass 2 (Colonel Blotto) Pass 1 (Rebel Group) with a score of -1, -1 1, and -1 Pass 2 (Rebel Group) with a score of -1, 1 1, and 1 To identify Nash equilibria, we must identify the strategies in which neither party has an incentive to stray from their selected strategy, given the strategy of the other player. If the rebels deploy their men to Pass 1, the best response for Colonel Blotto is to deploy his troops to Pass 2. (1, -1) If the rebels move their men to Pass 2, the best response for Colonel Blotto would be to deploy his troops to Pass 1. (-1, 1) If Colonel Blotto sends his men to Pass 1, the best response for the rebel group is to deploy their troops to Pass 2. (1, -1) In this game, there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria: (Pass 1, Pass 2) and (Pass 2, Pass 1), where Colonel Blotto deploys his soldiers to Pass 1 while the rebel group deploys their men to Pass 2, and vice versa.
