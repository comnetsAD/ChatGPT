This game can be characterized as a strategic form game, with two strategies available to each side (Colonel Blotto and the rebel group) (deploying their troops to Pass 1 or Pass 2). The following is a representation of the payout matrix: (Colonel Blotto) Pass 1 Pass 2 (Colonel Blotto) Pass 1 (Rebel Group) -1, -1 1, -1 Pass 2 (Rebel Group) -1, 1 1, 1 We must identify the strategies where neither player has a motivation to depart from their selected strategy given the other player's plan in order to locate the Nash equilibria. The best course of action for Colonel Blotto is to send his men to Pass 2 if the rebels send troops to Pass 1. (1, -1) The best course of action for Colonel Blotto is to move his men to Pass 1 if the rebels deploy their forces to Pass 2. (-1, 1) The best course of action for the rebel group is to send its forces to Pass 2 if Colonel Blotto sends his troops to Pass 1. (1, -1) The rebel group's best response to Colonel Blotto sending his men to Pass 2 is to send their troops to Pass 1. (-1, 1) Since Colonel Blotto deploys his forces to Pass 1, the rebel faction deploys its men to Pass 2, and vice versa, we can see that there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria in this game: (Pass 1, Pass 2) and (Pass 2, Pass 1). A Nash equilibrium with mixed strategies also exists, in which both players randomly choose their tactics with probability 1/2. Colonel Blotto, for instance, plays Pass 1 and Pass 2 with probabilities of 1/2 and 1/2, respectively, while the rebel group likewise plays Pass 1 and Pass 2 with probabilities of 1/2 and 1/2. Since each player is already benefiting from the largest projected reward possible as a result of the other player's mixed strategy, neither player has a reason to depart from their mixed strategy in this situation. It is important to note that the pure strategy Nash equilibria in this game are not Pareto efficient because both parties would benefit from sending their forces to the same pass, which would lead to a draw. This isn't a Nash equilibrium, though, because one player would have an incentive to stray and win. In conclusion, there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria (Pass 1, Pass 2) and (Pass 2, Pass 1) as well as one mixed strategy Nash equilibrium in which both players randomly choose their strategies with probability 1/2.
