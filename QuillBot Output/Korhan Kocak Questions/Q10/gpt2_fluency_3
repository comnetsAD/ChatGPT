This is a strategic type game with two players: Colonel Blotto and the rebel group. Each player has two options: deploy one regiment to each mountain pass or two regiments to one mountain pass. The following are the payoffs for each player: Colonel Blotto: One regiment per pass. Colonel Blotto: Two regiments per pass Rebel Group: 1 regiment for each pass (1,1). (-1,-1) Rebel Group: 2 regiments per pass (-1,-1) (1,1) A game's Nash equilibrium is a strategy combination in which neither player's payout can be improved by altering their strategy while the other player's approach stays intact. There are two Nash equilibria in this case: (Colonel Blotto: 1 regiment to each pass, Rebel Group: 1 regiment to each pass) with a reward of 1 for each participant. (Colonel Blotto: 2 regiments to one pass, Rebel Group: 2 regiments to one pass) with a reward of 1 for each player In the first equilibrium, each player sends one regiment to each mountain pass, ensuring that the rebel group cannot win anywhere and Colonel Blotto does not lose the fight. In the second equilibrium, each player deploys two regiments to one pass, implying that neither player can win since the game would always end in a draw. In both circumstances, no player can gain from altering their approach, hence these are the game's Nash equilibria.
