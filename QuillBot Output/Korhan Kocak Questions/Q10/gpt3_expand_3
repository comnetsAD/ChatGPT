This game might be thought of as a strategic form game, in which both Colonel Blotto and the rebel group have two different strategies at their disposal (deploying their troops to Pass 1 or Pass 2). One possible representation of the payout matrix is as follows: Pass 1 (Colonel Blotto) Pass 2 (Colonel Blotto) Take the following penalty for passing 1 (Rebel Group): -1, -1 1, -1 Take 2 (Rebel Group) and subtract 1, 1, 1, respectively. In order to determine the Nash equilibria, we need to locate the strategies in which neither party has an incentive to depart from the strategy that they have selected given the strategy that the other player has chosen. As for Colonel Blotto, the most effective strategy for him would be to move his troops to Pass 2 in the event that the rebels moved their forces to Pass 1. (1, -1) The ideal response for Colonel Blotto would be to deploy his forces to Pass 1 in the event that the insurgents sent their troops to Pass 2. (-1, 1) If Colonel Blotto deploys his men to Pass 1, the most effective course of action for the rebel organization would be to deploy their troops to Pass 2 in retaliation (1, -1) The best course of action for the rebel group would be to move their forces to Pass 1 in the event that Colonel Blotto moved his troops to Pass 2. (-1, 1) In addition to this, a mixed strategy Nash equilibrium exists, in which both players choose their strategy at random with a chance of half. For instance, Colonel Blotto plays Pass 1 with a probability of 1/2 and Pass 2 with a probability of 1/2, and the insurgent group also plays Pass 1 and Pass 2 with the same probabilities. Because both players are already receiving the largest expected return feasible given that the other player is also using a mixed strategy, neither one of them has a motivation to depart from the mixed strategy that they have chosen to use. In conclusion, there are three possible Nash equilibria: two pure strategy ones (Pass 1, Pass 2) and (Pass 2, Pass 1), and one mixed strategy one (where both players randomly choose their approach with a chance of 1/2).
