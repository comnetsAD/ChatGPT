Colonel Blotto and the rebels play this strategy game. Players may deploy one regiment to each mountain pass or two to one. Player payoffs: Colonel Blotto: Regiment per pass. Colonel Blotto: Two regiments per pass Rebels: 1 regiment per pass (1,1). (-1,-1) Rebel Group: 2 regiments per pass (-1,-1). (1,1) In a game's Nash equilibrium, neither player can increase their payout by altering their approach while the other player's strategy stays intact. Two Nash equilibria exist: (Colonel Blotto: 1 regiment to each pass, Rebel Group: 1 regiment to each pass) with a payout of 1. (Colonel Blotto: 2 regiments to one pass, Rebel Group: 2 regiments to one pass) with a payout of 1. In the first equilibrium, each player sends one regiment to each mountain pass, preventing the rebel force from winning anywhere and ensuring Colonel Blotto's triumph. Each side deploys two regiments to one pass in the second equilibrium, which guarantees a draw. Both tactics are Nash equilibria because no player benefits from altering them.
