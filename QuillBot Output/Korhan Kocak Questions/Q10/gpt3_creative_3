It's possible to describe this situation as a strategic form game, with two possible courses of action for each player (Colonel Blotto and the rebel group) (deploying their troops to Pass 1 or Pass 2). This is a representation of the payout matrix: General Orders, Please (Colonel Blotto) Pass 2 (Colonel Blotto) First Round: (Rebels) -1, (Rebels), (Rebels), (Rebels). Group 2 (Rebels) Pass -1, 1, 1, 1 Nash equilibria are the strategies when both players are equally content with their current strategy and have no need to change it in light of the other player's plan. If the rebels send troops through Pass 1, Colonel Blotto should do the same through Pass 2. (1, -1) Colonel Blotto should send his troops to Pass 1 if the rebels send theirs to Pass 2. (-1, 1) Assuming Colonel Blotto sends his men through Pass 1, the best course of action for the rebels would be to send their own troops through Pass 2. (1, -1) It is recommended that if Colonel Blotto sends his troops to Pass 2, the rebels respond by sending theirs to Pass 1. (-1, 1) This reveals that there are two possible Nash equilibria in this game, where Colonel Blotto sends his forces to Pass 1 while the rebel group sends theirs to Pass 2, and vice versa: (Pass 1, Pass 2) and (Pass 2, Pass 1). There is also a Nash equilibrium with mixed strategies, where each player randomly chooses their move with a chance of 1/2. For instance, Colonel Blotto plays Pass 1 with a probability of 1/2 and Pass 2 with a probability of 1/2, and the insurgents use the same strategy. Given that both players are obtaining the maximum expected payout from their mixed approach, there is no reason for either player to stray from it. In this game, both parties would be better off if they deployed their soldiers to the same pass, resulting in a draw, hence the pure strategy Nash equilibria are not Pareto efficient. One person has an incentive to deviate and achieve a victory, hence this is not a Nash equilibrium. One mixed strategy Nash equilibrium exists when both players randomly choose their approach with a probability of 1/2, while the other two pure strategy Nash equilibria are (Pass 1, Pass 2) and (Pass 2, Pass 1).
