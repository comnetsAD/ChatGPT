If a strategy gives each player a single action, it is considered a pure strategy. If a strategy gives each player a probability distribution over the possible actions, it is referred to as a mixed strategy. A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies with one for each participant such that no player can unilaterally change their strategy and increase their payoff. We can quickly determine for each player's strategy which action optimizes their payoff for every potential action of the opponent in order to determine the pure strategy Nash equilibria for this game. Player 1 (the row player) uses strategy U to maximize their payoff against player 2 (the column playerstrategy )'s L, which results in a payoff of 4, and against strategy R, which results in a payoff of 1. Similarly, player 2's strategy L maximizes their payoff when playing against player 1's strategy U, giving them a payoff of 4, and when playing against strategy D, giving them a payoff of 3. As a result, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (U, L), and player 1 and player 2 both receive payoffs of (1, 4) and (4, 1), respectively. We can employ the next technique to determine the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium: Put a probability (p) next to each player action. Describe the opponent's predicted payoffs as a function of the supplied probabilities. Find the probability that makes it indifferent between the acts by using the expected payoffs to determine the optimum reaction from the adversary. Let's imagine that for player 1 (the row player), p(U)=x, and p(D)=1-x. the following outcomes are anticipated for player 2 (column player): E(L)=x*1+(1-x) 3\sE(R)=x4+ (1-x)*2 The optimum course of action for Player 2 is to use Strategy L if E(L)>E(R) and Strategy R if E(R)>E. (L). Consequently, we must determine the value of x such that E(L) = E. (R) x*1+(1-x)3=x4+(1-x)*2\sx=1/2 Thus, p(U)=1/2 and p(D)=1/2. We can use a similar procedure for player 2 (column player), let's say p(L)=y, p(R)=1-y. After that, the anticipated gains for player 1 (the row player) are: E(U)=y*1+(1-y) 3\sE(D)=y4+ (1-y)*2 The optimum course of action for Player 1 is to choose strategy U if E(U)>E(D) and strategy D if E(D)>E. (U). Consequently, we must determine the value of y such that E(U) = E. (D) y*1+(1-y)3=y4+(1-y)*2\sy=1/2 Therefore, p(L)=1/2 and p(R)=1/2 As a result, player 1 and player 2 are in a Nash equilibrium with a mixed strategy that is (1/2, 1/2). In conclusion, the payoffs for players 1 and 2 are (1, 4) and (4, 1), respectively, in the pure strategy Nash equilibrium of (U, L). Additionally, for both players, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (1/2, 1/2).
