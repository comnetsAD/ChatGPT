The provided game is a normal form game, which implies that each player has a set of options and that the game's result is determined by the combination of strategies selected by both players. The participants in this example are U and D, and the tactics are L and R. The payoffs are written as (x, y), with x representing the payoff for player U and y representing the reward for player D. To discover the pure and mixed strategy Nash equilibria for this game, we must examine each player's optimum reaction given the strategy selected by the other player. If player D picks strategy L, then strategy L is the optimum answer for player U since it offers them a payout of 1, which is more than the payoff of 3 for strategy R. If player D picks strategy R, then strategy R is the optimum answer for player U since it provides a payout of 4, which is more than the value of 2 for strategy L. If player U picks strategy L, then strategy R is the optimum answer for player D since it provides a payout of 3, which is more than the value of 2 for strategy L. If player U picks strategy R, then strategy L is the optimum answer for player D since it provides a payout of 2, which is more than the payoff of 3 for strategy R. We can observe from this analysis that there are two pure strategy Nash equilibria in this game: (L, R) and (R, L). We may consider the likelihood of playing each strategy as a variable in mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Let x represent the chance of player U using strategy L and y represent the probability of player D using strategy L. The anticipated reward for strategy L for player U is x(1) + (1-x)(4), whereas the expected payoff for strategy R is x(4) + (1-x)(4) (1). The anticipated reward for strategy L for player D is y(3) + (1-y)(2), whereas the expected payoff for strategy R is y(2) + (1-y)(2) (3) We equalize the anticipated reward for both techniques and solve the system of equations. y(3) + (1-y)(2) = y(2) + (1-y)(1) x(1) + (1-x)(4) = x(4) + (1-x)(1) (3) This equation system yields x = 0.25 and y = 0.75. As a result, for this game, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (0.25, L) and (0.75, L) In summary, the pure strategy Nash equilibria for this game are (L, R) and (R, L), whereas the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (0.25, L) (0.75, L).
