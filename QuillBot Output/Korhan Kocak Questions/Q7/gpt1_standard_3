A simple tactic When two players are in a Nash equilibrium, neither has a reason to alter their approach in light of the other's tactics. mixed tactics A Nash equilibrium is a set of tactics where neither player has a reason to alter their approach in light of the other player's approach. We evaluate each player's strategy to determine whether it is the optimum response to the other player's plan in order to locate the pure strategy Nash equilibria. The optimum move for player 1 in response to player 2's plan L is to play U since it offers a better reward than choosing D. They should play D as their best reaction to player 2's plan R. Since player 1 plays U and player 2 plays L or player 1 plays D and player 2 plays R, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (U, L) and (D, R). The optimum move for player 2 in response to player 1's strategy U is to play R since it offers a greater reward than playing L. In a similar vein, playing L is the optimal reply to player 1's plan D. Since player 1 plays U or D and player 2 plays R or L, respectively, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (U, R) and (D, L). We must examine each player's anticipated payoffs in light of the mixed strategy of the other player in order to identify the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Let x represent the likelihood that player 1 will play U and y represent the likelihood that player 2 will play L. Then, player 1's anticipated gain is 1x + 3(1-x), while player 2's anticipated gain is 4y + 2. (1-y). In order for player 1 to be equally likely to play U or D, we need 1x + 3(1-x) = 4(1-x) + 3x, which may be expressed as x = 1/3. Let z represent the likelihood that player 2 will choose to play R. The predicted outcome is so 4x + 3(1-x) = 4(1/3) + 3(2/3) = 2 for player 1, and 2z + 3(1-z) = 2z + 3 for player 2. Player 2 must have 2z + 3(1-z) = 4y + 2(1-y) = 4(1/3) + 2(2/3) = 2, which reduces to z = 1/3, in order to be equally likely to play R or L. Since player 1 plays U with probability 1/3, player 2 plays L with probability 1/3, and player 3 plays R with probability 1/3, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (x, y, z) = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3).
