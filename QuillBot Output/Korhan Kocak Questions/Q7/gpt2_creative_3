The offered game is of the typical kind, in which each player has a set of tactics and the result is determined by the interplay of those strategies. U and D are the participants, while L and R are the possible approaches. Payoffs are shown in pairs, with x denoting the payout to Player U and y indicating the payout to Player D. In order to determine the pure and mixed strategy Nash equilibria of this game, we must take into account the optimal response of each player given the strategy selected by the other player. If player D choose L, then U should also respond with L, as the 1 they would get from it is more than the 3 they would earn through R. It follows that if player D selects R, player U should also respond with R, as the payment for R is 4, while the payoff for L is 2. The optimal answer for player D is strategy R if player U selects strategy L, as strategy R yields a reward of 3 while strategy L yields 2. Strategy L is the optimal answer for Player D if Player U selects R, as it pays out 2 instead of 3 for Player D. This analysis reveals that there are two possible pure strategy Nash equilibria in this game, denoted by the notation (L, R) and (R, L). The likelihood of using each strategy is a free-floating factor in the mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium. First, we'll say that Player U's likelihood of choosing Strategy L (represented by x) is equal to Player D's likelihood of choosing Strategy L (represented by y). Player U has an anticipated return of x(1) + (1-x)(4) for choosing strategy L, and x(4) + (1-x)(4) for choosing strategy R. (1). Specifically, the anticipated payment for player D's strategy L is y(3) + (1-y)(2), whereas the expected payoff for player D's strategy R is y(2) + (1-y)(2) (3) First, we solve the system of equations by making the anticipated reward of both methods equal. The sum of x(1) and (1-x)(4) is the same as x(4) and (1-x)(1), while the sum of y(3) and (1-y)(2) is the same as y(2) and (1-y)(3) (3) Solution to this system of equations yields (x, y) = (0.25, 0.75) This game has a mixed-strategy Nash equilibrium at (0.25, L), which means that (0.75, L) In conclusion, the (L, R) and (R, L) Nash equilibria for this game represent pure strategies, whereas the (0.25, L) and (R, L) Nash equilibria represent mixed strategies (0.75, L).
