A strategy is considered pure if it assigns only one action to each player. A mixed strategy is one that assigns a probability distribution over the actions to each player. A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player, in which no player can improve their payoff by switching to another strategy unilaterally. To find the pure strategy Nash equilibria for this game, simply look at each player's strategy and see which action maximizes their payoff for every possible action by the opponent. The strategy U maximizes the payoff for player 1 (row player) against strategy L of player 2 (column player) with a payoff of 4, and against strategy R with a payoff of 1. Similarly, for player 2, strategy L maximizes their payoff when compared to player 1's strategy U, with a payoff of 4, and when compared to strategy D, with a payoff of 3. As a result, the Nash equilibrium for pure strategy is (U, L), with payoffs of (1, 4) for player 1 and (4, 1) for player 2. We can use the following method to find the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium: Assign a probability (p) to each player action. Express the opponent's expected payoffs as a function of the assigned probabilities. Use the expected payoffs to determine the best response of the opponent and the probability that makes the action indifferent. Assume p(U)=x for player 1 (row player) and p(D)=1-x. The expected payoffs for player 2 (column player) are as follows: E(L)=x*1+(1-x) 3\sE(R)=x4+ (1-x)*2 Player 2 should use strategy L if E(L)>E(R), and strategy R if E(R)>E. (L). As a result, we must determine the value of x that causes E(L) to equal E. (R) x*1+(1-x)3=x4+(1-x)*2\sx=1/2 As a result, p(U)=1/2 and p(D)=1/2. We can repeat the process for player 2 (column player), p(L)=y, p(R)=1-y. The expected payoffs for player 1 (row player) are as follows: E(U)=y*1+(1-y) 3\sE(D)=y4+ (1-y)*2 Player 1 should use strategy U if E(U)>E(D) and strategy D if E(D)>E. (U). As a result, we must determine the value of y that causes E(U) to equal E. (D) y*1+(1-y)3=y4+(1-y)*2\sy=1/2 As a result, p(L)=1/2 and p(R)=1/2. As a result, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for player 1 is (1/2, 1/2) and (1/2, 1/2) for player 2. In summary, the Nash equilibrium for pure strategy is (U, L), with payoffs (1, 4) for player 1 and (4, 1) for player 2. And the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for both players is (1/2, 1/2).
