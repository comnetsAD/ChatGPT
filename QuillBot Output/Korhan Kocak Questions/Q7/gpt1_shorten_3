Pure strategy Given the opponent player's approach, a Nash equilibrium strategy has no motivation to alter. Mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is a strategy combination where neither player has an incentive to change given the other player's plan. We examine each player's strategy to determine the pure strategy Nash equilibria. Player 1's best reaction to player 2's plan L is U, which pays more than D. They should play D to counter player 2's R. Thus, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (U, L) or (D, R), where player 1 plays U and player 2 plays L or D and R. Player 2's best reaction to player 1's plan U is R, which pays more than L. L is their finest reaction to player 1's D. Thus, player 1 plays U or D while player 2 plays R or L in the pure strategy Nash equilibrium. Checking each player's anticipated payoffs given the other player's mixed strategy is the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Player 1 plays U while player 2 plays L. Player 1's projected payment is 1x + 3(1-x) while player 2's is 4y + 2. (1-y). Player 1 must be indifferent between playing U and D if 1x + 3(1-x) = 4(1-x) + 3x, which reduces to 1/3. Player 2 plays R with probability z. Player 1's anticipated payment is 4x + 3(1-x) = 4(1/3) + 3(2/3) = 2 while player 2's is 2z + 3(1-z). Player 2 must be indifferent between R and L if 2z + 3(1-z) = 4y + 2(1-y) = 4(1/3) + 2(2/3) = 2, which reduces to z = 1/3. Thus, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (x, y, z) = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3) where player 1 plays U with probability 1/3, player 2 plays L with 1/3, and player 3 plays R with 1/3.
