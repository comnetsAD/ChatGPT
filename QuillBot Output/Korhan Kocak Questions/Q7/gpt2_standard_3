The game being played is of the typical kind, meaning that each player has a set of tactics, and the mix of strategies used by both players determines how the game will turn out. The players here are U and D, and the approaches are L and R. The payouts are expressed as (x, y), where x is the payout for player U and y is the payout for player D. The appropriate reaction for each player given the strategy selected by the other player must be taken into account in order to determine the pure and mixed strategy Nash equilibria for this game. The best option for player U is strategy L if player D selects it because it offers a reward of 1, which is more than the payoff of 3 for strategy R. Player U's best option if player D picks strategy R is strategy R since it offers a reward of 4, which is greater than the payoff of 2 for strategy L. Player D's best course of action, if player U picks strategy L, is strategy R since it offers a reward of 3, greater than the payoff of 2 for strategy L. Player D's best course of action in the event that player U picks strategy R is strategy L since it offers a payout of 2, which is greater than the payoff of 3 for strategy R. This analysis reveals that this game has two pure strategy Nash equilibria: (L, R) and (R, L). The likelihood of using each method may be thought of as a variable for mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Let x represent the likelihood that player U will play strategy L, and y represent the likelihood that player D will play strategy L. The anticipated payout for player U is x(1) + (1-x)(4) for strategy L and x(4) + (1-x)(4) for strategy R. (1). Player D's predicted payoffs for strategies L and R are y(3) + (1-y)(2) and y(2) + (1-y), respectively (3) We next solve the system of equations by setting the anticipated reward for both methods to be equal to one another. In the same way as y(3) + (1-y)(2) = y(2) + (1-y), x(1) + (1-x)(4) = x(4) + (1-x)(1) (3) Using this set of equations, we get x = 0.25 and y = 0.75. Consequently, (0.25, L) and are the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium values for this game (0.75, L) In conclusion, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is (0.25, L), while the pure strategy Nash equilibria for it are (L, R) and (R, L) (0.75, L).
