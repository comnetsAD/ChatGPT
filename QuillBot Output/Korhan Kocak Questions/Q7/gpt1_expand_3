A pure strategy A strategy is said to be in Nash equilibrium when neither player has an incentive to modify their approach given the strategy that the other player is using. A tactic consisting of both The combination of tactics known as a Nash equilibrium is one in which neither player has an incentive to modify their strategy in light of the strategy used by the other player. In order to locate the pure strategy Nash equilibria, we examine each player's strategy to see whether or not it provides the optimal response to the strategy used by the other player. Playing U, rather than D, is the optimum move for player 1 to make in response to player 2's strategy L because playing U results in a bigger reward than playing D. In the same vein, the most effective way for them to react to player 2's tactic R is to play D. The pure strategy Nash equilibrium is thus either (U, L) or (D, R), where player 1 plays U and player 2 plays L or player 1 plays D and player 2 plays R, respectively. Playing R, rather than L, is the optimal response for player 2 to take to player 1's strategy U since playing R results in a greater payout than playing L does. Playing L is the most effective answer that player 2 may provide to player 1's plan D. As a result, the Nash equilibrium for the pure strategies is (U, R) and (D, L), where player 1 plays either U or D and player 2 plays either R or L correspondingly. Checking the predicted payoffs for each player given the mixed strategy of the other player is a necessary step in the process of locating the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Let's say that x represents the likelihood that player 1 will play U and y is the likelihood that player 2 will play L. The anticipated return for player 1 is 1x plus 3(1-x), whereas the expected return for player 2 is 4y plus 2. (1-y). In order for player 1 to be indifferent between playing U and D, we need to have 1x + 3(1-x) = 4(1-x) + 3x, which simplifies to x = 1/3. This is because we need to have 1x + 3(1-x) = 4(1-x) + 3x. In the same vein, we will refer to z as the likelihood that player 2 will play R. The anticipated payout for player 1 is thus calculated as follows: 4x + 3(1-x) = 4(1/3) + 3(2/3) = 2, whereas the expected payment for player 2 is calculated as follows: 2z + 3(1-z) = 2z + 3. We need to have 2z + 3(1-z) = 4y + 2(1-y) = 4(1/3) + 2(2/3) = 2, which simplifies to z = 1/3. This will allow player 2 to be indifferent between playing R and L. In light of this, the Nash equilibrium for mixed strategies is expressed as (x, y, z) = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3), where player 1 plays U with a probability of 1/3, player 2 plays L with a chance of 1/3, and player 3 plays R with a probability of 1/3.
