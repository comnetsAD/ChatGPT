Pure strategies give each player one action. A mixed strategy assigns each player a probability distribution over actions. No actor can improve their payout by unilaterally switching strategies in a Nash equilibrium. We may check each player's strategy to determine the pure strategy Nash equilibria for this game by maximizing their payoff for every opponent action. For player 1 (row player), strategy U maximizes their profit against strategy L of player 2 (column player) with a payoff of 4 and against strategy R with a payoff of 1. Player 2's strategy L maximizes their return against player 1's plan U, which pays 4, and against strategy D, which pays 3. Thus, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (U, L) with player 1 payoffs (1, 4) and player 2 (4, 1). Methods for finding the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium include: Player actions have a probability (p). Assign probability to opponent payoffs. Find the opponent's best reaction and its likelihood of indifference using expected payoffs. Player 1 (row playerp(U)=x )'s and p(D)=1-x. Player 2 (column player) should receive: E(L)=x*1+(1-x) 3\sE(R)=x4+ (1-x)*2 Player 2 should play strategy L if E(L)>E(R) and strategy R if E(R)>E. (L). Thus, we must find x that makes E(L) = E. (R) x*1+(1-x)3=x4+(1-x)*2\sx=1/2 p(U)=1/2 and p(D)=1/2. Let p(L)=y and p(R)=1-y for player 2 (column player). Player 1 (row player) expects these payoffs: E(U)=y*1+(1-y) 3\sE(D)=y4+ (1-y)*2 Player 1 should play strategy U if E(U)>E(D) and D if E(D)>E. (U). Thus, we must find y such that E(U) = E. (D) y*1+(1-y)3=y4+(1-y)*2\sy=1/2 p(L)=1/2 and p(R)=1/2. The mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for player 1 and player 2 is (1/2, 1/2). The pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (U, L) with player 1 payoffs (1, 4) and player 2 payoffs (4, 1). Players' mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (1/2, 1/2).
