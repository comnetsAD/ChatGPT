A strategy is said to be "pure" when it only gives one action to each participant in the game. If a strategy gives a different probability distribution for each player's actions, then it is considered to be a mixed strategy. A Nash equilibrium is a collection of strategies, one for each player, in which there is no way for any individual to improve their payout by switching to a different strategy without affecting the payoff of the other players. In order to determine the Nash equilibria for this game based solely on pure strategy, all that needs to be done is determine for each player's strategy which action optimizes their reward for each and every potential action taken by the other player. When player 1 (the row player) uses strategy U, their payoff is maximized against player 2's (the column player) strategy L, which results in a payoff of 4, and against player 2's strategy R, which results in a payoff of 1. In a similar vein, the strategy L of player 2 maximizes their payoff against player 1's strategy U with a payoff of 4, and against player 1's strategy D with a payoff of 3. As a result, the Nash equilibrium for a game with pure strategies is (U, L), with payoffs of (1, 4) for player 1 and (4, 1) for player 2. The following procedure might be utilized by us in order to locate the Nash equilibrium for mixed strategies: Put a probability, denoted by the symbol p, next to each action that a player takes. Provide an expression of the opponent's predicted payoffs in terms of the probabilities that have been allocated. Find the probability that makes the opponent indifferent between the multiple actions by using the expected payoffs to determine which is the best answer for the opponent to provide. Let's imagine that p(U)=x and p(D)=1-x for player 1, also known as the row player. The following are the payoffs that can be anticipated for Player 2 (the column player): E(L)=x*1+(1-x) 3\sE(R)=x4+ (1-x)*2 The optimal reaction for Player 2 is to play strategy L if the value of E(L)>E(R), and strategy R if the value of E(R)>E. (L). As a result, we have to calculate the value of x that will result in E(L) being equal to E. (R) x*1+(1-x)3=x4+(1-x)*2\sx=1/2 hence, p(D) = 1/2 and p(U) = 1/2 A similar procedure can be followed for player 2, also known as the column player. For this example, let's state that p(L)=y and p(R)=1-y. The following are the potential payoffs for player 1, often known as the row player: E(U)=y*1+(1-y) 3\sE(D)=y4+ (1-y)*2 The most effective reaction for Player 1 would be to play strategy U if E(U)>E(D), and strategy D if E(D)>E. (U). As a result, we have to calculate the value of y that will result in E(U) being equal to E. (D) y*1+(1-y)3=y4+(1-y)*2\sy=1/2 hence, p(L) = 1/2 and p(R) = 1/2 Therefore, the Nash equilibrium for a mixed strategy is (1/2, 1/2) for player 1 and (1/2, 1/2) for player 2. In a nutshell, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (U, L), where player 1 receives payoffs of (1, 4) and player 2 receives payoffs of (4, 1). And the Nash equilibrium for a game with mixed strategies is (1/2, 1/2) for both players.
