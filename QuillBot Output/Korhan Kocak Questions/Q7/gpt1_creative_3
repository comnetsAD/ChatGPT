Direct tactic When both players are in a Nash equilibrium, they have no reason to alter their play based on what the other player is doing. Combining approaches Nash equilibrium describes a set of playable options where neither player can gain an advantage by altering their play based on the opponent's action. As a means of identifying pure strategy Nash equilibria, we examine all possible responses to each player's strategy and determine which ones are optimal. The optimal answer for player 1 to player 2's approach L is U, which offers a greater return than D. Similarly, the optimal counter to player 2's approach of R is D. Consequently, (U, L) and (D, R) are the two possible configurations of the pure-strategy Nash equilibrium, with player 1 using U and player 2 using L or D and R. To maximize their return, player 2 should counter player 1's strategy U by choosing R. This is because L is the worst choice. If player 1 uses strategy D, then player 2 should counter with strategy L. Since player 1 may choose to play either U or D, and player 2, R or L, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (U, R) and (D, L). A mixed strategy Nash equilibrium may be located by comparing the predicted payoffs of each player under the assumption that the other player is also using a mixed strategy. Let x represent the likelihood that player 1 will choose U and let y represent the likelihood that player 2 will choose L. If so, then Player 2 should get 4y + 2 and Player 1 should receive 1x + 3(1-x) (1-y). We need 1x + 3(1-x) = 4(1-x) + 3x for player 1 to remain neutral between playing U and D, and this reduces to x = 1/3. In the same way, let z represent the chance that player 2 will use R. Then, Player 2 may anticipate receiving a payout of 2z + 3(1-z) = 2z + 3, whereas Player 1 can anticipate receiving a payout of 4x + 3(1-x) = 4(1/3) + 3(2/3) = 2. In order for Player 2 to remain neutral between playing Right or Left, we need z = 1/3, which simplifies to 2/3 + 1/3 = 4/3 + 2/3 = 2. Given that player 1 plays U with probability 1/3 and player 2 plays L with probability 1/3 and plays R with probability 1/3, the corresponding Nash equilibrium (x, y, z) = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3).
