A pure strategy Nash equilibrium is a strategy in which neither player has an incentive to alter their approach given the opponent's plan. A mixed approach The Nash equilibrium is a combination of tactics in which neither player has an incentive to alter their plan in response to the strategy of the other player. To determine the pure strategy Nash equilibria, we examine each player's strategy to see whether it is the optimal response to the other player's plan. The optimal answer for player 1 to player 2's tactic L is to play U, which results in a greater reward than playing D. Likewise, the optimal response to player 2's approach R is D. The pure strategy Nash equilibrium is thus (U, L) and (D, R), in which player 1 plays U and player 2 plays L, or player 1 plays D and player 2 plays R. The optimal answer for player 2 to player 1's tactic U is to play R, since it yields a greater return than playing L. Likewise, the optimal answer to player 1's approach D is L. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium for pure strategies is (U, R) and (D, L), where player 1 plays U or D and player 2 plays R or L, respectively. To determine the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we must examine the anticipated payoffs for each player given the mixed strategy of the other player. Let x represent the likelihood that player 1 will play U and y represent the likelihood that player 2 will play L. The projected payouts for players 1 and 2 are 1x + 3(1-x) and 4y + 2, respectively (1-y). 1x + 3(1-x) = 4(1-x) + 3x, which simplifies to x = 1/3, is required for player 1 to be indifferent between playing U and D. Similarly, let z be the likelihood that player 2 will play R. Then the anticipated return for player 1 is 4x + 3(1-x) = 4(1/3) + 3(2/3) = 2 and for player 2 it is 2z + 3(1-z) = 2z + 3. 2z + 3(1-z) = 4y + 2(1-y) = 4(1/3) + 2(2/3) = 2, simplifying to z = 1/3. Therefore, the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (x, y, z) = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3), where player 1 plays U with a 1/3 chance, player 2 plays L with a 1/3 chance, and player 3 plays R with a 1/3 chance.
