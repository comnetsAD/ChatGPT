Pure strategies only provide each player one specific task to complete. When a strategy gives each participant a different probability distribution over the actions, we call it a mixed strategy. For any two players, there exists a set of strategies called a Nash equilibrium where neither can increase their payout by changing strategies unilaterally. In order to determine the Nash equilibria for this game, we need only determine for each player's strategy which action maximizes their reward for every potential action of the opponent. Strategy U maximizes the payout for player 1 (row player) against both strategy L (column player) with a payoff of 4, and strategy R (column player) with a payoff of 1. Similarly, player 2's best bet against both player 1's strategy U (payoff 4) and player 2's plan D (payoff 3) is to use strategy L. As a result, (U, L) is the Nash equilibrium for the pure strategy, with player 1's payoffs being (1, 4) and player 2's payoffs being (4, 1). We can use the following procedure to get the Nash equilibrium for a game with more than one possible strategy: The player's actions should be assigned a probability (p). To calculate the opponent's expected return, use the probabilities you've given them. By calculating the anticipated value of each possible action, you may determine the optimal response of your opponent and the likelihood at which it will do any of the possible actions. For the sake of argument, let's pretend that p(U)=x and p(D)=1-x for player 1 (the row player). If that is the case, then player 2's (column player) projected payoffs are: E(L)=x*1+(1-x) 3\sE(R)=x4+ (1-x)*2 A good reaction for Player 2 is to choose Strategy L if Expected Value (E(L)>E(R)) and Strategy R if Expected Value (E(R)>E(L)) (L). So, we need to determine the x such that E(L) equals E. (R) x*1+(1-x)3=x4+(1-x)*2\sx=1/2 Hence, p(U)=1/2 and p(D)=1/2 For the second player (the column player), we may use the same method: p(L)=y, p(R)=1-y. Then, Player 1 (the one in the first row) can anticipate these payouts: E(U)=y*1+(1-y) 3\sE(D)=y4+ (1-y)*2 Playing strategy U if E(U)>E(D) and D if E(D)>E(U) is the optimal answer for Player 1. (U). We need to determine the value of y such that E(U) equals E. (D) y*1+(1-y)3=y4+(1-y)*2\sy=1/2 , p(L) = 1/2, p(R) = 1/2. Therefore, the (1/2, 1/2) Nash equilibrium for player 1 and (1/2, 1/2) for player 2 is the optimal outcome for a game with mixed strategies. In conclusion, the payoffs for Player 1 are (1, 4) and Player 2's are (4, 1) in the Nash equilibrium for a pure strategy (U, L). Also, the Nash equilibrium for a game with mixed strategies is (1/2, 1/2).
