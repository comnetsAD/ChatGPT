A straightforward method Nash equilibrium is a strategy in which neither party has an incentive to modify their plan in light of the other player's approach. A hybrid approach Nash equilibrium is a combination of tactics in which neither party has an incentive to modify their plan in light of the other player's approach. To determine the pure strategy Nash equilibria, we examine each strategy for each player to see whether it is the optimum response to the strategy of the other player. Player 1's best reaction to player 2's strategy L is to play U, which has a bigger reward than playing D. Similarly, in response to player 2's plan R, they should play D. As a result, the Nash equilibrium for pure strategy is (U, L) and (D, R), where player 1 plays U and player 2 plays L, or player 1 plays D and player 2 plays R. Player 2's best reaction to player 1's strategy U is to play R, which has a bigger reward than playing L. Similarly, in response to player 1's tactic D, they should play L. As a result, the pure strategy Nash equilibrium is (U, R) and (D, L), with player 1 playing U or D and player 2 playing R or L. To discover the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium, we must examine the anticipated payoffs for each player given the mixed strategy of the other player. Let x represent the likelihood that player 1 will play U and y represent the probability that player 2 will play L. Then player 1's anticipated payment is 1x + 3(1-x), while player 2's expected payoff is 4y + 2. (1-y). To have player 1 choose between playing U and D, we need 1x + 3(1-x) = 4(1-x) + 3x, which simplifies to x = 1/3. Let z be the likelihood that player 2 will play R. The anticipated payout for player 1 is 4x + 3(1-x) = 4(1/3) + 3(2/3) = 2 and for player 2 is 2z + 3(1-z) = 2z + 3. To get 2z + 3(1-z) = 4y + 2(1-y) = 4(1/3) + 2(2/3) = 2, we need 2z + 3(1-z) = 4y + 2(1-y) = 4(1/3) + 2(2/3) = 2, which simplifies to z = 1/3. As a result, the Nash equilibrium for a mixed strategy is (x, y, z) = (1/3, 1/3, 1/3), where player 1 plays U with probability 1/3, player 2 plays L with probability 1/3, and player 3 plays R with probability 1/3.
