The game is a normal form game, meaning each player has a set of tactics and the result relies on their combination. U and D play L and R tactics. Players U and D's payoffs are (x, y). This game's pure and mixed strategy Nash equilibria depend on each player's optimum reaction to the other's strategy. For player U: If player D picks strategy L, player U's optimal response is strategy L, which offers them a payout of 1, greater than strategy R's payoff of 3. If player D picks strategy R, player U's optimum response is strategy R, which provides them a 4 reward compared to strategy L's 2. For player D: If player U picks strategy L, player D's optimum response is strategy R, which provides them a reward of 3 instead of 2. Player D's best reaction to player U's strategy R is strategy L, which offers them a reward of 2, greater than strategy R's 3. From this analysis, this game has two pure strategy Nash equilibria: (L, R) and (R, L). The likelihood of playing each strategy is a variable for mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Let x and y be player U's and player D's strategy L probabilities. Player U's anticipated payout for strategy L is x(1) + (1-x)(4) and for strategy R, x(4) + (1-x) (1). Player D's anticipated payout for strategy L is y(3) + (1-y)(2) and for strategy R, y(2) + (1-y) (3) We solve the system of equations by setting the anticipated reward for both options equal. y(3) + (1-y)(2) = y(2) + (1-y) (3) This system yields x = 0.25 and y = 0.75. This game's mixed strategy Nash equilibrium is (0.25, L) and (0.75, L) In conclusion, the pure strategy Nash equilibria for this game are (L, R) and (R, L), while the mixed strategy equilibrium is (0.25, L) (0.75, L).
