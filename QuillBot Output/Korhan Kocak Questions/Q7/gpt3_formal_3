A strategy is considered pure if it assigns each player a single action. If a strategy assigns a probability distribution over the actions to each player, it is a mixed strategy. A Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each player, in which no player can increase their payoff by switching unilaterally to a different strategy. To determine the pure strategy Nash equilibria for this game, we need to determine for each player's strategy the action that maximizes their payoff for each conceivable opponent action. For player 1 (row player), strategy U maximizes payoff against player 2's (column player) strategy L with a payoff of 4, and against player 2's (column player) strategy R with a payoff of 1. Similarly, player 2's strategy L optimizes their reward versus player 1's strategies U and D with a payoff of 4 and 3, respectively. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium for pure strategy is (U, L) with payoffs (1, 4) for player 1 and (4, 1) for player 2. To obtain the Nash equilibrium for mixed strategies, we can use the following method: Assign a probability (p) to each player action. Express the opponent's predicted payoffs as a function of the allocated probabilities. Determine the optimal opponent reaction based on the predicted payoffs and the likelihood that makes the opponent indifferent between the actions. Let's imagine that for player 1 (the row player), p(U)=x and p(D)=1-x. Then, player 2's (column player) estimated payoffs are: E(L)=x*1+(1-x) 3\sE(R)=x4+ (1-x)*2 The optimal reaction for Player 2 is to play strategy L if E(L) > E(R) and strategy R if E(R) > E. (L). Therefore, we must determine the value of x such that E(L) = E (R) x*1+(1-x)3=x4+(1-x)*2\sx=1/2 hence p(U) = 1/2 and p(D) = 1/2 For player 2 (column player), a similar procedure can be applied; for example, p(L)=y and p(R)=1-y. The expected returns for player 1 (row player) are therefore: E(U)=y*1+(1-y) 3\sE(D)=y4+ (1-y)*2 The optimal response for Player 1 is strategy U if E(U)>E(D) and strategy D if E(D)>E. (U). Therefore, we must determine the value of y such that E(U) = E (D) y*1+(1-y)3=y4+(1-y)*2\sy=1/2 hence p(L) = 1/2 and p(R) = 1/2 Thus, the Nash equilibrium for mixed strategies is (1/2, 1/2) for player 1 and (1/2, 1/2) for player 2. In conclusion, the Nash equilibrium for pure strategy is (U, L) with payoffs (1, 4) for player 1 and (4, 1) for player 2. And the Nash equilibrium for mixed strategies is (1/2, 1/2) for both players.
