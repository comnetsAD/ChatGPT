The game that is being played is of the usual form, which indicates that each player has a set of tactics and that the result of the game is determined by the combination of strategies selected by both players. In this scenario, the players U and D are responsible for executing the tactics L and R. The payoffs are represented as (x, y), where x indicates the payoff for player U and y indicates the reward for player D. In order to determine the pure strategy and mixed strategy Nash equilibria for this game, it is necessary to take into account the optimal response for each player, taking into account the strategy that the other player has selected. If player D picks strategy L, then player U should also choose strategy L as their answer since it provides them a payout of 1, which is more than the payoff of 3 for strategy R. If player D choose strategy R, then player U should also select strategy R as their answer since it provides them with a reward of 4, which is more than the value of 2 that strategy L provides. If player U selects strategy L, then player D's best answer is strategy R since it provides them a payout of 3, which is greater than the payoff of 2 for strategy L. If player U chooses strategy R, then player D's best response is strategy R. If player U choose strategy R, then player D should react by selecting strategy L since it provides them with a payout of 2, which is more than the payoff of 3 for strategy R. As a result of this analysis, we are able to deduce that there exist two Nash equilibria in this game that include just pure strategies: (L, R), and (R, L). We may think of the likelihood of playing each strategy as a separate variable for the sake of the mixed strategy Nash equilibrium. Let's say that x represents the likelihood that player U will play strategy L, and that y represents the probability that player D will play strategy L. The anticipated return on investment for player U's strategy L is x(1) + (1-x)(4), whereas the expected return on investment for player U's strategy R is x(4) + (1-x) (1). The anticipated reward for player D's choice of strategy L is y(3) + (1-y)(2), whereas the expected payoff for player D's choice of strategy R is y(2) + (1-y) (3) After making sure that the returns on investment for both approaches are the same, we go ahead and solve the system of equations. x(1) + (1-x)(4) = x(4) + (1-x)(1) y(3) + (1-y)(2) = y(2) + (1-y) (3) The solution to this set of equations is that x = 0.25 and y = 0.75. The mixed strategy Nash equilibrium for this game is thus (0.25, L), and (0.75, L) In conclusion, the Nash equilibria for this game with pure strategies are (L, R) and (R, L), whereas the Nash equilibria for this game with mixed strategies are (0.25, L) and (R, L) (0.75, L).
