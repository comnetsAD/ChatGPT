The provided game is a normal form game, meaning that each player has a set of options and the result is determined by the combination of strategies selected by both players. In this instance, U and D are the players, whereas L and R are the tactics. The payouts are represented as (x, y), where x is the payout for player U and y is the payout for player D. To determine the pure and mixed strategy Nash equilibria for this game, we must evaluate each player's optimal reaction given the strategy selected by the other player. If player D picks strategy L, then strategy L is the optimal answer for player U, since the payment of 1 is greater than the payoff of 3 for strategy R. If player D picks strategy R, then the optimal answer for player U is also strategy R, since the payout of 4 is greater than the payoff of 2 for strategy L. If player U picks strategy L, then strategy R is the optimal answer for player D, since the payout of 3 is greater than the payoff of 2 for strategy L. If player U picks strategy R, then the optimal answer for player D is strategy L, since the payout of 2 is greater than the payoff of 3 for strategy R. This analysis reveals that this game has two pure strategy Nash equilibria: (L, R) and (R, L). For mixed-strategies Nash equilibrium, the chance of playing each strategy may be considered a variable. Let x represent the chance of choosing strategy L for player U, and let y represent the likelihood of choosing strategy L for player D. The anticipated reward for player U's strategy L is x(1) + (1-x)(4), whereas the expected payoff for strategy R is x(4) + (1-x) (1). For player D, predicted payoffs for strategies L and R are y(3) + (1-y)(2) and y(2) + (1-y), respectively (3) The system of equations is solved after setting the anticipated reward for both methods to be equal. x(1) + (1-x)(4) = x(4) + (1-x)(1) y(3) + (1-y)(2) = y(2) + (1-y) (3) This system of equations yields the values x = 0.25 and y = 0.75. Therefore, the Nash equilibrium for mixed strategies in this game is (0.25, L) and (0.75, L) In conclusion, the pure strategy Nash equilibria for this game are (L, R) and (R, L), whereas the mixed strategy Nash equilibria are (0.25, L) and (R, L) (0.75, L).
