There are 26 different options for the letter, 9 different options for the second digit, and 10 different options for the first digit (since the two digits must be distinct). As a consequence, there is a total of 10269, which equals 2340 different possible serial numbers. If each of the 6,000 pieces had its own unique serial number, then the total number of unique serial numbers would be 6,000. On the other hand, given that this is not the situation, there must be at least two different pieces that have the same serial number. As a result, the bare minimum amount of components that need to have the same serial number is 2.
