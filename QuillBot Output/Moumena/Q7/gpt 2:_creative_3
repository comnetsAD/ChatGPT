There are ten possible combinations of the first digit, twenty-six for the letter, and ten for the second digit, for a total of twenty-six thousand. Given that the manufacturer produced 6,000 units last week, the smallest possible number of units that can share a serial number is (6,000 / 26,000) = 0.23, or about 1. This means that there must be at least one piece with the same serial number.
