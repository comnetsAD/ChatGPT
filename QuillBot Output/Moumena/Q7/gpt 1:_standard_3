There are 26 options for the letter, 10 for the first digit, and 9 for the second digit (since the two digits must be distinct). There are so 10269 = 2340 potential serial numbers in all. There would be a total of 6,000 unique serial numbers if each of the 6,000 parts had a unique serial number. There must be at least two parts with the same serial number since this is not the case. Consequently, two parts are the bare minimum that must share the same serial number.
