There are ten options for the first digit, 26 for the letter, and nine for the second digit (since the two digits must be distinct). As a result, there are 10269 = 2340 possible serial numbers. There would be 6,000 different serial numbers if each of the 6,000 parts had a different serial number. However, since this is not the case, at least two parts with the same serial number must exist. As a result, the minimum number of parts with the same serial number is two.
