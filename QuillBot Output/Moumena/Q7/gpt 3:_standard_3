There are 260 different serial numbers for each part because there are 26 uppercase letters (A, B, C, D,..., Z) and 10 numerals (0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). Accordingly, each serial number will typically be present in the set of 6,000 items 6000/260 = 23 times. We need to determine the number of components that occur the most frequently in order to determine the bare minimum of parts that must share the same serial number. If there are X parts total, then all X parts must share a serial number. By rounding 23 to the nearest integer, we can determine the value of X. X = 23 since 23 is already an integer. Therefore, 23 pieces are the bare minimum that must share the same serial number.
