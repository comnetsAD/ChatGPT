There are 10 options for the first digit, 26 for the letter, and 10 for the second digit, for a total of 26,000 possible codes (10 * 26 * 10) The minimum number of components that must have the same serial number is 6,000 / 26,000 = about 0.23, which is equal to approximately one part. Therefore, a minimum of one component must have the same serial number.
