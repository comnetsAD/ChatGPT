The first digit can be any of the ten available, the letter any of the twenty-six, and the second of the nine (since the two digits must be distinct). That adds up to a total of 10269 = 2340 distinct serial numbers. There would be 6,000 unique serial numbers if each of the 6,000 components had its own. In any event, since this is not the case, there must be at least two components with the same serial number. That means that a minimum of two components must share the same serial number.
