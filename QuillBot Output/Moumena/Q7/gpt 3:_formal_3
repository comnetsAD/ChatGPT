There are 10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and 26 uppercase letters (A, B, C, D,..., Z) in each part's serial number, for a total of 10*26 = 260 potential serial numbers. This indicates that, on average, each serial number will appear 23 times in the 6,000-piece collection. To determine the minimum number of components that must share the same serial number, we must determine the number of components that occurs most often. If this quantity of components is X, then all X components must have the same serial number. The value of X can be determined by rounding 23 to the nearest integer. X = 23 since 23 is already an integer. The smallest number of components that must share a serial number is therefore 23.
