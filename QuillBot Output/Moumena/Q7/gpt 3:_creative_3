All together, there are 260 distinct serial numbers that may be assigned to each component using the 26 letters and 10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9). If there are 6,000 pieces, then each serial number will appear 6000/260 = 23 times. We need to find the most common number of pieces in order to determine how many are required to share a serial number. If there are X components, then all X of them should share the same serial number. By estimating the result of rounding 23 to the next whole number, we may determine X's value. Due to the fact that 23 is an integer, X = 23. Consequently, there must be at least 23 identical components.
