There are ten digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and 26 uppercase letters (A, B, C, D,..., Z) in each part, for a total of 260 possible serial numbers. This means that each serial number will appear 6000/260 = 23 times in the set of 6,000 parts on average. To determine the smallest number of parts that must share the same serial number, we must first determine the number of parts that appear the most frequently. If there are X parts, all of them must have the same serial number. By rounding 23 up to the nearest integer, we can find the value of X. X = 23 because 23 is already an integer. As a result, the minimum number of parts with the same serial number is 23.
