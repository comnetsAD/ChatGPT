10 digits, 26 letters, and 9 second digits are available (since the two digits must be distinct). 10269 = 2340 serial numbers are conceivable. There would be 6,000 serial numbers if each part had a different one. Since this is not true, at least two parts must have the same serial number. Thus, two parts must share a serial number.
