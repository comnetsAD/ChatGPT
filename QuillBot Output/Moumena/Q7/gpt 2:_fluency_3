There are ten options for the first digit, 26 for the letter, and ten for the second digit, for a total of 10 * 26 * 10 = 26,000 codes. If the factory produced 6,000 parts last week, the minimum number of parts that must share the same serial number is 6,000 / 26,000 = approximately 0.23, or approximately 1 part. As a result, the bare minimum of parts that must have the same serial number is one.
