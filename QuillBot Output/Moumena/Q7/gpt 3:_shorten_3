10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and 26 uppercase letters (A, B, C, D,..., Z) make 260 potential serial numbers for each part. In 6,000 pieces, each serial number will occur 6000/260 = 23 times. The most common number of parts must have the same serial number to determine the minimal number. X pieces must share a serial number. Rounding 23 to the nearest integer yields X. X Equals 23 since 23 is integer. 23 pieces must share a serial number.
