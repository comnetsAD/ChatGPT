There are 10 options for the initial digit, 26 for the letter, and 9 for the second digit (since the two digits must be distinct). Consequently, there are 10269 + 2360 = 2340 potential serial numbers. If each of the 6,000 pieces had a unique serial number, there would be 6,000 unique serial numbers in total. Due to the fact that this is not the case, there must be at least two identical pieces. Therefore, a minimum of two components must have the same serial number.
