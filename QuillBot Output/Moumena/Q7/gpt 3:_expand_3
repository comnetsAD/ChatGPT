There are 10 digits (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and 26 uppercase letters (A, B, C, D,..., Z), which means that there are a total of 10*26 = 260 possible serial numbers for each individual component. In order to calculate the bare minimum of components that must share a serial number, we need to first determine the number of components that are used most frequently. If there are X total parts, then each one of those parts must have its own unique serial number. Simply by rounding 23 up to the next whole number, we may determine what X's value is. Given that 23 is already an integer, the answer to X's equation is 23. Therefore, 23 is the bare minimum for the amount of components that need to have the same serial number.
