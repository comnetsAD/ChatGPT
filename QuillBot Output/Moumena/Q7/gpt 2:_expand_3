There are 10 different options for the first digit, 26 different options for the letter, and 10 different options for the second digit, which brings the total number of possible codes to 10 times 26 times 10. If the factory produced 6,000 parts in the past week, the minimal number of parts that must have the same serial number is 6,000 divided by 26,000, which is around 0.23, which is roughly equivalent to one item. As a result, the bare minimum amount of components that need to have the same serial number is 1.
