We can look for a counterexample to this statement to either prove or disprove it. First, let's rephrase the assertion as "If p and q are primes > 2, then pq + 1 is composite." Allowing p = 3, q = 5, we get pq + 1 = 3 * 5 + 1 = 16. Since 16 is composite, this statement holds. The statement holds if we set p = 5 and q = 7, since pq + 1 = 5 * 7 + 1 = 36, and 36 is composite. This statement holds true regardless of what values of p and q are tried. Since both p and q must be primes greater than 2, it follows that pq + 1 is never a prime number by itself.
