To put it another way, the claim that "If p and q are primes > 2, then pq + 1 is never prime" is incorrect. The situation where p = 3 and q = 5 illustrates this. This is not a prime number because pq + 1 = 35 + 1 = 16. With these values, however, we get pq + 1 = 57 + 1 = 36, which is likewise not prime. Alternatively, if we set p = 5 and q = 11, we get the prime number 56 from the product of those two numbers (5*11+1). As a result, we know that pq + 1 is prime for some values of p and q. If p and q are both prime numbers greater than 2, then it follows that pq + 1 is never a prime number.
