"If p and q are primes > 2, then pq + 1 is never prime" is untrue. Consider p = 3 and q = 5. pq + 1 = 35 + 1 = 16, not prime. pq + 1 = 57 + 1 = 36 is also not prime if p = 5 and q = 7. pq + 1 = 5*11 + 1 = 56, which is prime, if p = 5 and q = 11. pq + 1 is prime for some values of p and q. "If p and q are primes > 2, then pq + 1 is never prime" is untrue.
