We can search for a counterexample to prove or reject this statement. Rewrite the statement as follows: "If p and q are primes greater than 2, then pq + 1 is composite." If p = 3 and q = 5, then pq + 1 = 3 * 5 + 1 = 16. Since 16 is a composite number, this statement is true. If p = 5 and q = 7, then pq + 1 = 5 * 7 + 1 = 36. Since 36 is composite, this proposition also holds true in this instance. We can continue to experiment with various values of p and q and find that this statement is always valid. Therefore, the statement "If p and q are primes greater than 2, then pq + 1 is never prime" must be true.
