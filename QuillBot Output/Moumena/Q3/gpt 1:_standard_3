It is untrue to say that pq + 1 is never a prime if p and q are both prime numbers greater than 2. Let's look at the situation where p = 3 and q = 5 to see this. In this instance, pq + 1 = 35 + 1 = 16 is not a prime number. If p = 5 and q = 7, however, then pq + 1 = 57 + 1 = 36, which is likewise not a prime number. However, if p = 5 and q = 11, then pq + 1 = 511 + 1 = 56, which is not a prime number. If p = 11 and q = 13, however, then pq + 1 = 1113 + 1 = 144, which is likewise not a prime number. Thus, it is untrue to say that pq + 1 is never a prime number if p and q are both prime numbers greater than 2.
