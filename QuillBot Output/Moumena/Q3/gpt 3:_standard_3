We can attempt to locate a counterexample in order to support or refute this claim. The sentence should now read, "If p and q are primes > 2, then pq + 1 is composite," to start. If we assume that p = 3 and q = 5, then pq + 1 = 3 * 5 + 1 = 16 as 16 is a composite number. This is also true if we set p = 5 and q = 7, since 36 is a composite number, and pq + 1 = 5 * 7 + 1 = 36. We can keep experimenting with different p and q values and discover that this statement is always true. It follows that the statement "If p and q are primes > 2, then pq + 1 is never prime" is accurate.
