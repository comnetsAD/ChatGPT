If p and q are primes greater than 2, then pq + 1 cannot be prime. Consider the instance where p = 3 and q = 5 to illustrate this point. pq + 1 = 35 + 1 = 16, which is not a prime number. Nevertheless, if p = 5 and q = 7, then pq + 1 = 57 + 1 = 36, which is not prime either. Alternatively, if p = 5 and q = 11, then pq + 1 = 5*11 + 1 = 56, which is a prime number. This demonstrates that there are p and q variables such that pq + 1 is prime. If p and q are both primes greater than 2, then pq + 1 is never prime.
