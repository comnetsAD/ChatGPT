We can try to find a counterexample to prove or disprove this statement. Let us first rephrase the statement: "If p and q are primes greater than 2, then pq + 1 is composite." If p = 3 and q = 5, then pq + 1 = 3 * 5 + 1 = 16, so this statement is correct in this case. If p = 5 and q = 7, then pq + 1 = 5 * 7 + 1 = 36. Since 36 is a composite number, this statement holds true in this case as well. We can keep trying different values of p and q until we find that this statement is always true. As a result, we can conclude that the statement "If p and q are primes greater than 2, then pq + 1 is never prime" is correct.
