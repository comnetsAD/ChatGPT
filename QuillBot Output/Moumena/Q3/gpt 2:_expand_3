It is not true that "If p and q are primes > 2, then pq + 1 is never prime." This assertion has been proven to be incorrect. Consider the scenario in which p equals 3 and q equals 5 to further understand this point. In this particular scenario, pq plus 1 is 35 plus one, which equals 16, which is not a prime. On the other hand, if we consider p to be 5 and q to be 7, then pq plus 1 equals 57 plus 1 to get 36, which is likewise not a prime number. If, on the other hand, we assume p to be the value 5 and q to be the value 11, we find that pq plus 1 equals 5 times 11 plus 1, which is the prime number 56. This demonstrates that there are indeed values of p and q such that pq + 1 is prime in some situations. As a result, the assertion that "If p and q are primes > 2, then pq + 1 is never prime" is untrue. p and q must both be prime numbers greater than 2.
