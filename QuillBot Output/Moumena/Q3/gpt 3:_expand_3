To demonstrate or deny the validity of this assertion, we can look for a contrasting case. First, let's rephrase the sentence such that it reads as follows: "If p and q are primes greater than 2, then pq + 1 is composite." If we assume that p is equal to 3, and q is equal to 5, then pq + 1 equals 3 * 5 + 1, which equals 16, and since 16 is a composite number, this assertion is accurate for this scenario. If we assume that p is equal to 5 and q is equal to 7, then pq + 1 is 5 times 7 plus 1, which equals 36. Since 36 is a composite number, this statement is accurate for this scenario as well. We can keep trying out new numbers for p and q, and regardless of what we choose for them, we will find that this assertion is always accurate. Because of this, we are able to draw the conclusion that the assertion "If p and q are primes > 2, then pq + 1 is never prime" is accurate.
