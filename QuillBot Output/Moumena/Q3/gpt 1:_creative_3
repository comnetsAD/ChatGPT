To put it another way, the claim that "If p and q are primes > 2, then pq + 1 is never prime" is incorrect. So, let's take the example where p = 3 and q = 5 to show this in action. This is not a prime number because pq + 1 = 35 + 1 = 16. With these values, however, we get pq + 1 = 57 + 1 = 36, which is likewise not prime. The number 56 is not prime, but if we set p = 5 and q = 11, we get pq + 1 = 511 + 1 = 56. Take p = 11 and q = 13 and you get 1113 + 1 = 144, which is not prime either. If p and q are both prime numbers greater than 2, then it follows that pq + 1 is never a prime number.
