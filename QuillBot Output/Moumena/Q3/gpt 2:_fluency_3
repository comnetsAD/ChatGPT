The statement "If p and q are primes greater than 2, then pq + 1 is never prime" is incorrect. Consider the situation where p = 3 and q = 5. In this case, pq + 1 equals 35 + 1 = 16, which is not a prime number. If we take p = 5 and q = 7, then pq + 1 = 57 + 1 = 36, which is also not a prime number. If we take p = 5 and q = 11, we get pq + 1 = 5*11 + 1 = 56, which is prime. This demonstrates that there are p and q values such that pq + 1 is prime. As a result, the statement "If p and q are primes greater than 2, then pq + 1 is never prime" is false.
