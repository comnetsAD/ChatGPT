A truth table that has nine distinct Boolean variables will have 29 rows, which is equal to 512 rows total. This is due to the fact that a truth table contains a listing of all of the conceivable combinations of inputs, and for each Boolean variable, there are two possible values: true or false. As a result, there are 29 different permutations of inputs when there are nine variables involved.
