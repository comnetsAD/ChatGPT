There are 30 options available for the very first doughnut that you select, followed by 29 options for the second doughnut, 28 options for the third doughnut, and so on. This indicates that there are 30 * 29 * 28 *... * 19 * 18 * 17 different combinations available in order to select 12 doughnuts from the shop. This equates to 30!/(12! * 18!), which is equivalent to approximately 3.2*1013 possible outcomes.
