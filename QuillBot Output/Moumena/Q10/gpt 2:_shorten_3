The probability that a random positive integer under 100 has all distinct digits equals the number of such integers divided by the total number of integers under 100. 90 two-digit integers have 9 tens digits and 10 units digits. 9 one-digit integers exist. This yields 99 integers under 100. The number of integers with unique digits is the product of the number of choices for the tens digit and the number of choices for the units digit, or 9*9 = 81. Thus, the likelihood that a random positive integer smaller than 100 has all distinct digits is 81/99, or 0.8182.
