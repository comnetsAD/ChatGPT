Randomly selecting a positive integer less than 100 with all distinct digits has a probability of, where, is the number of such integers, and, is the total number of integers less than 100. Each of the 90 possible 2-digit integers can be represented by one of nine different tens digits and ten different unit digits. In addition, there are 9 numbers that only have one digit. Therefore, we now have 99 numbers between 0 and 100. There are nine one-digit integers, and 81 two-digit numbers with distinct digits (9 x 9 = 81), where 9 is the number of alternatives for the tens digit and 9 is the number of choices for the units digit. Thus, 81 out of 99, or around 0.8182, of randomly selected positive integers smaller than 100 have unique digits.
