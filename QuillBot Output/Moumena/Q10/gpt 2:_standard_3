The proportion of such positive integers among all positive integers less than 100 is the likelihood that a positive integer less than 100 chosen at random has all distinct digits. There are a total of 90 integers with two digits, with 9 options for the tens digit and 10 options for the units digit. There are another nine integers with one digit. We now have a total of 99 integers below 100. The total number of distinct integers among them is equal to the sum of the number of distinct one-digit integers (9) and the number of distinct two-digit integers (28), which is equal to the sum of the options for the tens and units digits, or 9*9 = 81. Therefore, 81/99, or around 0.8182, is the probability that a positive integer less than 100 chosen at random has all different digits.
