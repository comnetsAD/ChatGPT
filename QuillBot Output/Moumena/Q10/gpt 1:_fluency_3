The probability that a random positive integer less than 100 has all distinct digits is equal to the number of such integers divided by the total number of integers less than 100. Because there are 99 positive integers less than 100, the total number of integers less than 100 is 99. To determine the number of distinct digits, we first count the number of one-digit integers, which is 9. (since there are nine one-digit integers with distinct digits: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). The number of two-digit integers with distinct digits is then counted, which is eight (since the first digit can be any of the nine one-digit integers with distinct digits, and the second digit can be any of the eight one-digit integers with distinct digits not equal to the first digit). As a result, the total number of distinct integers is 9 + 8 = 17. The likelihood of a positive integer less than 100 having all distinct digits is 17/99, or approximately 0.171717.
