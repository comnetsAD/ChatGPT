The proportion of such positive integers among all positive integers less than 100 is the likelihood that a positive integer less than 100 chosen at random has all distinct digits. Since there are 99 positive numbers that are smaller than 100, there are a total of 99 negative integers. We begin by counting the number of one-digit integers, which totals 9, before counting the number of integers with different digits (since there are nine one-digit integers with distinct digits: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). The number of two-digit numbers with distinct digits is then counted, and it is 8 in total (since the first digit can be any of the nine one-digit integers with distinct digits, and the second digit can be any of the eight one-digit integers with distinct digits not equal to the first digit). As a result, there are 9 + 8 = 17 different integers in total. It is 17/99, or roughly 0.171717, likely that a positive integer less than 100 chosen at random has all distinct digits.
