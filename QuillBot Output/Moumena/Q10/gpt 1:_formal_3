The likelihood that a randomly selected positive integer less than 100 has all distinct digits is proportional to the number of such integers divided by the total number of integers less than 100. There are 99 positive integers less than 100, hence the total number of integers less than 100 is 99. To determine the number of integers having distinct digits, we begin by counting the nine one-digit integers (since there are nine one-digit integers with distinct digits: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). Next, we determine that there are eight two-digit numbers with distinct digits (since the first digit can be any of the nine one-digit integers with distinct digits, and the second digit can be any of the eight one-digit integers with distinct digits not equal to the first digit). 9 plus 8 equals 17, which is the entire number of integers with different digits. 17/99, or about 0.171717, is the likelihood that a positive integer smaller than 100 chosen at random has all distinct digits.
