The probability that a random positive integer under 100 has all distinct digits equals the number of such integers divided by the total number of integers under 100. Since there are 99 positive integers under 100, the total is 99. To count integers with distinct digits, we first count the 9 one-digit integers (since there are nine one-digit integers with distinct digits: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). We count 8 unique two-digit integers (since the first digit can be any of the nine one-digit integers with distinct digits, and the second digit can be any of the eight one-digit integers with distinct digits not equal to the first digit). Thus, 17 integers have different digits. A positive integer less than 100 generated at random with all distinct digits 17/99, or 0.171717.
