There are nine options for the initial digit out of a total of 100 positive integers less than 100. (since it cannot be 0). There are nine choices for the second digit for each of these options (since it must be different from the first digit). Thus, the number of positive integers smaller than 100 that have all different digits is 9*9=81. Therefore, 81/100, or around 0.81, is the likelihood that a positive integer less than 100 chosen at random has all distinguishable digits.
