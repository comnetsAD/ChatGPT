Among the 100 positive integers less than 100, 9 different ones could serve as the initial digit (since it cannot be 0). There are 9 possible options for the second digit in each of these cases (since it must be different from the first digit). This means that there are 81 positive integers smaller than 100 with exactly 9 different digits (9 multiplied by 9). Therefore, 81/100, or approximately 0.81, is the likelihood that a positive integer less than 100 selected at random has all distinct digits.
