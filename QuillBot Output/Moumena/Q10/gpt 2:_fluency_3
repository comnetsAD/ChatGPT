The probability that a random positive integer less than 100 has all distinct digits is equal to the number of such integers divided by the total number of integers less than 100. There are nine options for the tens digit and ten options for the units digit, for a total of 90 two-digit integers. There are 9 one-digit integers as well. This gives us 99 integers that are less than 100. The number of integers with distinct digits is equal to the sum of the number of one-digit integers (9) plus the number of two-digit integers with distinct digits, which is equal to the product of the number of tens digit choices and the number of units digit choices, or 9*9 = 81. As a result, the probability that a positive integer less than 100 chosen at random has all distinct digits is 81/99, or roughly 0.8182.
