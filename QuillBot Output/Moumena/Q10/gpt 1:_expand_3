The ratio of the total number of positive integers that are less than 100 to the number of integers that have all distinct digits is used to calculate the chance that a positive integer will have all distinct digits when it is chosen at random. Due to the fact that there are 99 positive integers that are fewer than 100, the total number of integers that are less than 100 is 99. First, we count the number of integers with a single digit, which comes to 9, and then we count the number of integers with two distinct digits (since there are nine one-digit integers with distinct digits: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). After that, we do a tally of the number of two-digit integers that each have their own unique digits, which comes to 8. (since the first digit can be any of the nine one-digit integers with distinct digits, and the second digit can be any of the eight one-digit integers with distinct digits not equal to the first digit). 9 plus 8 equals 17, which is the total amount of integers that have digits that are distinct from one another. 17 out of 99, which is about 0.171717, is the likelihood that an integer with a positive value that is less than 100 and chosen at random has all distinct digits.
