The likelihood that a randomly selected positive integer less than 100 has all distinct digits is proportional to the number of such integers divided by the total number of integers less than 100. There are nine options for the tens digit and ten options for the units digit, for a total of ninety two-digit integers. There are another nine integers with one digit. This gives us 99 integers less than 100 in total. The number of integers with distinct digits is equal to the sum of the number of one-digit integers (9) and the number of two-digit integers with separate digits, which is equal to the product of the number of options for the tens digit and the number of options for the units digit, or 9*9 = 81. Therefore, the likelihood that a randomly selected positive integer smaller than 100 has all distinct digits is 81/99, or approximately 0.8182.
