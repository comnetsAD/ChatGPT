There are 100 positive integers less than 100, and nine options for the initial digit (since it cannot be 0). For each of these options, nine options exist for the second digit (since it must be different from the first digit). Therefore, there exist 81 positive integers with distinct digits that are smaller than 100. Therefore, the likelihood that a randomly selected positive integer smaller than 100 has all distinct digits is 81/100, or approximately 0.81.
