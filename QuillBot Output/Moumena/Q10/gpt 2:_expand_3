The ratio of the total number of positive integers that are less than 100 to the number of integers that have all distinct digits is used to calculate the chance that a positive integer will have all distinct digits when it is chosen at random. There are a total of nine alternatives for the digit representing the tens and ten choices for the digit representing the units, making the number of integers with two digits ninety. There are also nine integers with a single digit. This brings our total number of numbers that are less than 100 to 99. The number of integers with distinct digits is equal to the product of the number of choices for the tens digit and the number of choices for the units digit, which is equal to the product of the number of choices for the tens digit and the number of choices for the units digit, or 9*9 = 81. This means that the number of integers with distinct digits is equal to the sum of the number of one-digit integers (9) and the number of two-digit integers As a result, the likelihood that an integer with a positive value that is less than 100 and chosen at random includes digits that are all unique is 81/99, which is almost equivalent to 0.8182.
