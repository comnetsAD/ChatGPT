Randomly selecting a positive integer less than 100 with all distinct digits has a probability of, where, is the number of such integers, and, is the total number of integers less than 100. There are 99 positive integers less than 100, hence the total number of integers less than 100 is 99. Since there are 9 one-digit integers, we know that there must be 9 integers with at least one distinct digit (since there are nine one-digit integers with distinct digits: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9). The next step is to determine that there are 8 two-digit integers that are completely unique (since the first digit can be any of the nine one-digit integers with distinct digits, and the second digit can be any of the eight one-digit integers with distinct digits not equal to the first digit). This means that there are 17 distinct integers (9 + 8) in total. Assuming a random selection of positive integers less than 100, the odds of getting one with exactly 100 distinct digits is 17/99, or around 0.171717.
