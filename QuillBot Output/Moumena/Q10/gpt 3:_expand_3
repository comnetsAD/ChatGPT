There is a total of 100 positive integers that are less than 100, and you have 9 options for the initial digit of each of those integers (since it cannot be 0). There are nine different options available for the second digit for each of these options (since it must be different from the first digit). As a consequence of this, there are 9 times 9 or 81 positive integers that are less than 100 and have digits that are all unique. Therefore, the likelihood that a positive integer smaller than 100 chosen at random has all unique digits is 81/100, which can be streamlined to around 0.81
