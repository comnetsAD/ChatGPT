There are 100 positive integers less than 100 in total, with 9 options for the first digit (since it cannot be 0). There are 9 options for the second digit for each of these options (since it must be different from the first digit). As a result, there are a total of 9*9=81 distinct positive integers less than 100. The probability of a positive integer less than 100 having all distinct digits is thus 81/100, which simplifies to approximately 0.81.
