The statement "Any product of two irrational numbers is irrational" is correct. To demonstrate this, suppose x and y are two irrational numbers and the product xy is rational. This means that there are some integers a and b where b is not equal to zero and xy = a/b. Then we'll be able to write: x = (a/b) / y Because x is irrational and y is nonzero, (a/b) must be irrational as well. However, (a/b) equals the xy product, which we assumed to be rational. Because this is a contradiction, our assumption that xy is rational must be incorrect. As a result, the product of two irrational numbers must also be irrational.
