This is a correct assertion. In order to demonstrate this, let's begin by presuming that the sum of any two irrational integers is also irrational. Let's say we have two irrational numbers, x and y, as an example. It is possible to refer to their product as xy. It stands to reason that xy is irrational as well, given that x and y are both illogical. The fact that this is the case demonstrates that the product of any two irrational numbers is also irrational.
