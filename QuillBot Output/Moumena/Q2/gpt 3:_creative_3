In reality, "the product of any two irrational numbers is irrational" is true in all cases. For the sake of argument, let's say that x and y are both irrational numbers but that the product, xy, is rational. That's right; there are numbers a and b, and b isn't necessarily zero, so that xy = a/b. Next, we can put down what follows: x = (a/b) / y (a/b) must be irrational because both x and y are illogical. Although we considered xy to be rational, (a/b) is equivalent to that product. Since this is illogical, we can no longer believe that xy is rational. As a result, it is also irrational to multiply two irrational integers together.
