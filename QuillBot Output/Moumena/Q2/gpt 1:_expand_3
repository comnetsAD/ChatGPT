The assertion that "The product of any two irrational numbers is irrational" is one that may be verified as being correct. In order to demonstrate this, let us first assume for the sake of argument that the sum of two irrational numbers, x and y, is rational. This indicates that there are some integers a and b, where b is greater than zero, and such that: xy = a/b Because x and y are both irrational, it is impossible to describe them as the ratio of two numbers; therefore, we have no choice but to set a = 0. On the other hand, this indicates that xy = 0, which is an impossible proposition given that neither x nor y are equal to 0. Our assumption that the product of x and y is rational must, as a result, be incorrect. This indicates that the product of any two irrational numbers is also irrational. This line of reasoning demonstrates that the assertion "The product of any two irrational numbers is also an irrational number" is always accurate.
