It is true that the product of any two irrational numbers is irrational. To demonstrate this, suppose the product of two irrational numbers, x and y, is rational. This means that there are some integers a and b, with b equal to zero, such that: xy = a/b Because x and y are irrational, they cannot be expressed as a ratio of two integers, so a = 0. This, however, implies that xy = 0, which is a contradiction because x and y are not equal. As a result, our assumption that the product of x and y is rational must be false, implying that the product of any two irrational numbers is irrational as well. This demonstration demonstrates that the statement "The product of any two irrational numbers is irrational" is always true.
