Any multiplication of irrational numbers also results in an irrational number. Let's assume that x + y, the product of two irrational numbers, is rational so that we may demonstrate our point. As a result, there are numbers a and b, where b is nonzero, such that: xy = a/b Since neither x nor y is rational, we have to set a=0 because they cannot be written as the ratio of two numbers. If x and y are not equal to zero, then the equation xy = 0 is false. Because the product of any two irrational integers is also irrational, we can safely discard our initial hypothesis that x times y is rational. With this proof, we can see that it is always the case that the product of two irrational integers is also irrational.
