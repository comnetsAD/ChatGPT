In point of fact, it is the case that the assertion "The product of any two irrational integers is also irrational" is correct. In order to demonstrate this, let us first assume that the integers x and y are both irrational, but that the product of these two numbers, xy, is rational. This indicates that there are certain numbers a and b, with b not being equal to zero, such that xy may be expressed as a ratio of a to b. Then the following is some possible writing: x = (a/b) / y Given that x is irrational and y is not zero, we can conclude that (a/b) is similarly irrational. However, since (a/b) is equivalent to the product xy, which we thought to be rational, this contradicts our assumption. Due to the fact that this is a contradiction, we can conclude that our premise that xy is rational is not accurate. Therefore, any product of irrational numbers must also be irrational. This applies to any two irrational numbers.
