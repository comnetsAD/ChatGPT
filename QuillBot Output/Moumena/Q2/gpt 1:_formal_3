It is true that the product of any two irrational numbers is also irrational. Let's assume that the product of two irrational numbers, x and y, is rational to demonstrate this. This indicates that there exist integers a and b, with b less than zero, such that: xy = a/b Given that x and y are irrational, they cannot be stated as the ratio of two numbers; hence, a must equal 0. However, this implies that xy equals zero, which is a contradiction because x and y are not equal to zero. Our premise that the product of x and y is rational must be wrong, which indicates that the product of any two irrational integers is also irrational. This argument demonstrates that "The product of any two irrational numbers is irrational" is always true.
