It is accurate to say that "The product of any two irrational numbers is irrational." Let's assume that x and y are two irrational integers and that the product of x and y is rational in order to demonstrate this. As a result, xy = a/b occurs for certain numbers a and b where b is not equal to 0. When it happens, we can write: x = (a/b) / y Because y is nonzero and x is irrational, (a/b) must likewise be irrational. The product xy, which we presummated to be rational, is equivalent to (a/b), nevertheless. Because of the contradiction, we must conclude that xy is not rational. As a result, any two irrational numbers must also have an irrational result.
