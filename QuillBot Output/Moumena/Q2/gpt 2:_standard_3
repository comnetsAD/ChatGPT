The assertion is accurate. Let's assume that any two irrational integers have an irrational result in order to demonstrate this. Consider two irrational numbers x and y in this case. Their product can be written as xy. It follows that xy is unreasonable because x and y are both illogical. This demonstrates that any two irrational numbers will always produce an illogical result.
