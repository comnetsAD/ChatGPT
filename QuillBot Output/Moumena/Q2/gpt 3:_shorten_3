"Any two irrational numbers are irrational" is true. Let's assume x and y are irrational numbers and that xy is reasonable. xy = a/b for certain numbers a and b with b not equal to 0. Thus: x = (a/b) / y (a/b) is unreasonable since x and y are irrational. The rational product xy is equal to (a/b). This paradox disproves our rationality premise. Thus, any product of irrational numbers is irrational.
