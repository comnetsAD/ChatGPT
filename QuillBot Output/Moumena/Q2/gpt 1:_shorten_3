"Any product of two irrational numbers is irrational" is true. Let's assume that x + y is reasonable. Thus, for integers a and b with b < 0, xy = a/b x and y are irrational, hence a = 0. This implies that xy = 0, which is impossible since x and y are not equal. Thus, any product of two irrational numbers is irrational. This proves that "The product of any two irrational numbers is irrational" is always true.
