It is true that any two irrational numbers have an illogical result. Let's assume that x and y are the product of two irrational numbers in order to demonstrate this. This indicates that some integers a and b, with b 0, exist such that: xy = a/b We must have a = 0 since x and y cannot be stated as the ratio of two numbers because they are irrational. This, however, implies that xy = 0, which is absurd because x and y do not equal 0. The conclusion is that our presumption that the product of x and y is rational must be incorrect, and that any two irrational numbers have illogical products. The result of any two irrational numbers is always irrational, as demonstrated by this demonstration.
