Actually, "The product of any two irrational numbers is irrational" is correct. To demonstrate this, let's assume that x and y are irrational numbers and that xy is a rational number. This indicates that there exist some non-zero integers a and b such that xy = a/b. The following can therefore be written: x = (a/b) / y Since both x and y are illogical, (a/b) must likewise be irrational. But (a/b) is equivalent to the assumedly rational product xy. This is an example of a contradiction, so our assumption that xy is rational must be untrue. The product of any two irrational numbers must thus also be irrational.
