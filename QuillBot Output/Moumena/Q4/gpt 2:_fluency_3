We will use Bayes' Theorem to solve this problem. According to Bayes' Theorem, P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P (B) Where P(A|B) is the probability of event A occurring if event B has occurred, P(B|A) is the probability of event B occurring if event A has occurred, P(A) is the probability of event A occurring if event B has occurred, P(A) is the probability of event A occurring, and P(B) is the probability of event B occurring. In this case, we can let event A be "the urn with 6 red balls was chosen", and event B be "a red ball was drawn". As a result, we want to find P(A|B). P(B|A) = 6/9 (the probability of drawing a red ball from an urn containing 6 red balls), P(A) = 1/2 (the probability of selecting the urn containing 6 red balls), and P(B) = 11/20 (the probability of drawing a red ball from either urn). When we plug these numbers into Bayes' Theorem, we get: P(A|B) = (6/9 * 1/2) / (11/20) = 12/22 = 2/11 Given that a red ball was drawn, the probability that the urn with 6 red balls was chosen is 2/11.
