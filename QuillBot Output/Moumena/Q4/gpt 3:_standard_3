We must apply Bayes' rule in order to resolve this issue. Let U1 be the selection of the urn containing the six red balls, and let R be the event that the ball pulled is red. We are looking for P(U1|R). The Bayes rule gives us: P(U1|R) is equal to P(R|U1)*P(U1)/P. (R) P(U1) = 1/2 and P(R) = (6/9) * (1/2) + (5/13) * (1/2) = 47/108 are the values that are supplied to us. We must determine the likelihood of pulling a red ball from the urn with six red balls in order to determine P(R|U1). Simply 6/9, then. Using the formula above and these values, we obtain: P(U1|R) = (6/9) * (1/2) / (47/108) = 36/47 In light of the fact that a red ball was drawn, the likelihood that the urn containing 6 red balls was selected is 36/47.
