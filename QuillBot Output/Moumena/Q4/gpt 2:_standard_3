The Bayes Theorem will be used to resolve this issue. According to Bayes' Theorem, P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P (B) Where P(A|B) represents the likelihood that event A will occur given that event B has already happened, P(B|A) represents the likelihood that event B will occur given that event A has already happened, and P(A) represents the likelihood that event A will occur. In this instance, we can define event B as "a red ball was drawn," and event A as "the urn with 6 red balls was picked." So, we're looking for P(A|B). P(B|A) = 6/9 (the likelihood of drawing a red ball from an urn containing six red balls), P(A) = 1/2 (the likelihood of selecting the urn containing six red balls), and P(B) = 11/20 are all supplied to us (the probability of drawing a red ball from either urn). When we enter these values into the Bayes' Theorem, we get the following results: P(A|B) = (6/9 * 1/2) / (11/20) = 12/22 = 2/11. In light of the fact that a red ball was picked, the likelihood that the urn containing 6 red balls was selected is 2/11.
