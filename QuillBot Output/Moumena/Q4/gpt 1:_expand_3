Let's say that the event R1 is when the urn that contains all six red balls is picked, and let's say that R is when one of the red balls is drawn. We are looking for the value of P(R1|R). According to the theorem of Bayes, we have: P(R1|R) = P(R|R1) * P(R1) / P (R) The probability of selecting the urn that contains six red balls is denoted by the symbol P(R1), and it is equal to one half. The chance of drawing a red ball, denoted by the symbol P(R), is equal to (6/9) + (5/13)/2 = 31/52. Given that the urn containing six red balls was selected, the chance of drawing a red ball, denoted by the symbol P(R|R1), is equal to six out of nine, or 6/9. When we enter these figures into the formula presented before, we obtain the following result: P(R1|R) = (6/9) * (1/2) / (31/52) = 12/31 Given that a red ball was selected from the urn, the likelihood that the urn that contains six red balls will be chosen is 12 out of 31.
