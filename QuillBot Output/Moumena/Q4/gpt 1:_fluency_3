Let R1 represent the event of selecting the urn with 6 red balls, and R represent the event of drawing a red ball. We're looking for P(R1|R). According to Bayes' theorem, we have: P(R1|R) = P(R|R1) * P(R1) * P(R1) / P (R) P(R1) denotes the probability of selecting the urn with six red balls, which is half. The probability of drawing a red ball is P(R), which is (6/9 + 5/13)/2 = 31/52. P(R|R1) denotes the probability of drawing a red ball if the urn with six red balls is chosen, which is 6/9. When we plug these values into the above formula, we get: P(R1|R) = (6/9) * (1/2) / (31/52) = 12/31 Given that a red ball is drawn, the probability of selecting the urn with 6 red balls is 12/31.
