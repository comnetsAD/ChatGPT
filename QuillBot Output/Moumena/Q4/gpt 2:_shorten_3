Bayes' Theorem will solve this. Bayes' Theorem asserts that P(A|B) = (P(B|A)*P(A)) / P (B) P(A|B) is the probability of event A occurring given that event B has occurred, P(B|A) is the chance of event B occurring given that event A has occurred, and P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of events A and B, respectively. Here, event A is "the urn with 6 red balls was chosen" and event B is "a red ball was drawn". We seek P(A|B). P(B|A) = 6/9, P(A) = 1/2, and P(B) = 11/20. (the probability of drawing a red ball from either urn). Bayes' Theorem yields P(A|B) = (6/9 * 1/2) / (11/20) = 12/22 = 2/11. Given a red ball, the likelihood that the urn with 6 red balls was chosen is 2/11.
