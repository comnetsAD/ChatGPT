Bayes' rule is necessary to address this situation. Let R represent the event that the drawn ball is red and U1 represent the event that the urn containing six red balls is selected. We wish to locate P(U1|R). Bayes' rule dictates that: P(U1|R) = P(R|U1) * P(U1) / P (R) P(U1) is stated to be 1/2, and P(R) is provided to be (6/9) * (1/2) + (5/13) * (1/2) = 47/108. To calculate P(R|U1), we must determine the probability of pulling a red ball from the urn containing six red balls. This is just 6 out of 9 Inputting these values into the aforementioned formula, we obtain: P(U1|R) = (6/9) * (1/2) / (47/108) = 36/47 Given that a red ball was drawn, the likelihood that the urn containing six red balls was selected is 36/47.
