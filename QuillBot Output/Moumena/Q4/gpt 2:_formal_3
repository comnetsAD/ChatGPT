Bayes' Theorem will be utilized to tackle this issue. According to Bayes' Theorem, P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P(A) (B) Where P(A|B) is the probability of event A occurring if event B has occurred, P(B|A) is the chance of event B occurring if event A has occurred, and P(A) and P(B) are the probabilities of events A and B occurring, respectively. In this scenario, event A can be "the urn containing six red balls was selected" and event B can be "a red ball was drawn." Consequently, we wish to locate P(A|B). P(B|A) = 6/9 (the probability of drawing a red ball from the urn with 6 red balls), P(A) = 1/2 (the probability of selecting the urn with 6 red balls), and P(B) = 11/20 (the likelihood of drawing a red ball) are given (the probability of drawing a red ball from either urn). By using Bayes' Theorem to these numbers, we obtain: P(A|B) = (6/9 * 1/2) / (11/20) = 12/22 = 2/11 Given that a red ball was drawn, the likelihood that the urn with six red balls was selected is 2/11.
