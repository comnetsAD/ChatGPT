Bayes' rule is what we need to apply in order to solve this dilemma. Let's say the chance is R that the ball that gets drawn is red, and let's say the chance of getting the urn that has 6 red balls is U1. We are looking for the solution P(U1|R). According to the rule of Bayes, we have: P(U1|R) = P(R|U1) * P(U1) / P (R) The values P(U1) = 1/2 and P(R) = (6/9) * (1/2) + (5/13) * (1/2) = 47/108 are presented to us as givens. In order to determine the value of P(R|U1), we must first determine the chance of pulling a red ball from the urn that contains six red balls. This is merely a 6 out of 9 Putting these numbers into the formula up above, we obtain the following: P(U1|R) = (6/9) * (1/2) / (47/108) = 36/47 Given that a red ball was pulled, the probability that the urn that contained six red balls was chosen is therefore 36 out of 47.
