Bayes' Theorem will be utilized to achieve this goal. It can be shown using Bayes' Theorem that the probability of event A given event B is given by the formula P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P (B) In this equation, P(A|B) represents the likelihood of event A occurring if and only if event B has already taken place, P(B|A) represents the likelihood of event B occurring if and only if event A has already taken place, P(A) represents the likelihood of event A occurring, and P(B) represents the likelihood of event B occurring. Event A can be "the urn containing the six red balls was selected," and Event B can be "a red ball was drawn." Thus, we are interested in determining P(A|B). The odds of picking a red ball from the urn containing six red balls, P(B|A) = 6/9, are provided, as are the odds of picking the urn containing six red balls, P(A) = 1/2, and P(B) = 11/20. (the probability of drawing a red ball from either urn). Bayes' Theorem is used to calculate the probability that event A will occur given event B, and the inputs are as follows: P(A|B) = (6/9) * 1/2 / (11/20) = 12/22 = 2/11 If a red ball is drawn, then there is a 2 in 11 chance that the urn containing six red balls will be selected.
