The application of Bayes' Theorem will allow us to successfully resolve this issue. According to Bayes's Theorem, P(A|B) = (P(B|A) * P(A)) / P (B) Where P(A|B) represents the probability that event A will occur given that event B has already taken place, P(B|A) represents the probability that event B will occur given that event A has already taken place, P(A) represents the probability that event A will take place, and P(B) represents the probability that event B will take place. In this particular instance, we can define event A as "the urn containing six red balls was selected," and we may define event B as "a red ball was drawn." As a result, we need to locate the value of P(A|B). P(B|A) = 6/9 is the chance of drawing a red ball from the urn that has 6 red balls, P(A) = 1/2 is the probability of choosing the urn that has 6 red balls, and P(B) = 11/20 is the probability of picking the urn that does not have 6 red balls (the probability of drawing a red ball from either urn). When we put these numbers into Bayes' Theorem, we get the following result: P(A|B) = (6/9 * 1/2) / (11/20) = 12/22 = 2/11 Given that a red ball was picked from the urn, the likelihood that the urn was selected which contained six red balls is therefore 2/11.
