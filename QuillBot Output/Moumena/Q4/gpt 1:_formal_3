Let R1 represent the event where the urn containing six red balls is selected, and let R represent the event where a red ball is drawn. We wish to locate P(R1|R). According to Bayes' theorem, we have: P(R1|R) = P(R|R1) * P(R1) / P (R) 1/2 is P(R1), the probability of selecting the urn containing six red balls. The probability of drawing a red ball is (6/9) + (5/13)/2 = 31/52 (P(R)). P(R|R1) equals 6/9, which is the chance of drawing a red ball if the urn containing six red balls is selected. Inputting these numbers into the preceding calculation, we obtain: P(R1|R) = (6/9) * (1/2) / (31/52) = 12/31 Given that a red ball is drawn, the probability that the urn containing six red balls is selected is 12/31.
