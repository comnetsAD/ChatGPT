A red ball being drawn is event R, while selecting urn R1 (containing all six red balls) is event R. Our goal is to calculate P(R1|R). This is what we get from Bayes' theorem: In other words, P(R1|R) = P(R|R1) * P(R1) / P (R) Choose the urn containing 6 red balls with a probability of P(R1) = 1/2. The odds of picking a red ball, denoted by the probability function P(R), are 6/9 + 5/13/2 = 31/52. Assuming the urn containing six red balls is selected, the chance of drawing a red ball, P(R|R1), is 6/9. When we use these numbers in the previous formula, we get P(R1|R) = (6/9) * (1/2) / (31/52) = 12/31 Therefore, if a red ball is drawn, the odds of the urn with six red balls being selected are 12 out of 31.
