We must apply Bayes' rule to solve this problem. Let R denote the event in which the ball drawn is red, and U1 denote the event in which the urn with six red balls is chosen. We're looking for P(U1|R). According to Bayes' rule, we have: P(U1|R) = P(R|U1) * P(U1) * P(U1) / P (R) P(U1) equals 1/2 and P(R) equals (6/9) * (1/2) + (5/13) * (1/2) = 47/108. P(R|U1) is the probability of drawing a red ball from an urn containing 6 red balls. This is just 6/9. When we enter these values into the formula above, we get: P(U1|R) = (6/9) * (1/2) / (47/108) = 36/47 Given that a red ball was drawn, the probability that the urn with 6 red balls was chosen is 36/47.
