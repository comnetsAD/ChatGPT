We need to apply Bayes' rule to this situation. Let's call the possibility that the drawn ball is red (R) and the selection of the urn containing six red balls (U1) the two possible outcomes. In order to do this, we need to calculate P(U1|R). To apply Bayes' theorem, we have: We can write this as P(U1|R) = P(R|U1) * P(U1) / P (R) P(U1) = 1/2 and P(R) = (6/9) * (1/2) + (5/13) * (1/2) = 47/108 are the values provided to us. The chance that one will pull a red ball from an urn containing six red balls is denoted by P(R|U1). No, this is just a 6/9. This is what we get when we use the above formula with these numbers: P(U1|R) = (6/9) * (1/2) / (47/108) = 36/47 Considering that a red ball was drawn, the odds of the urn containing six red balls being selected are 36 to 47.
