Let R1 represent the selection of the urn containing the six red balls, and let R represent the drawing of a red ball. We are looking for P(R1|R). The Bayes theorem provides us with: P(R1|R) is equal to P(R|R1)*P(R1)/P. (R) The probability of selecting the urn with 6 red balls is P(R1), which is equal to 1/2. The likelihood of drawing a red ball is P(R), which equals (6/9 + 5/13)/2 = 31/52. Given that the urn with 6 red balls is selected, the likelihood of drawing a red ball is P(R|R1), which is 6/9. When these values are plugged into the calculation above, we get the following result: P(R1|R) = (6/9) * (1/2) / (31/52) = 12/31 Therefore, there is a 12/31 chance that the urn with 6 red balls will be selected if a red ball is drawn.
