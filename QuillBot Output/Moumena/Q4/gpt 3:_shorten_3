Bayes' rule solves this. R is drawn red and U1 is the urn with 6 red balls. Find P(U1|R). Bayes' rule: P(U1|R) = P(R|U1) * P(U1)/P (R) P(U1) = 1/2 and P(R) = (6/9) + (5/13) * (1/2) = 47/108. P(R|U1) is the probability of drawing a red ball from the urn with 6 red balls. 6/9. We get: P(U1|R) = (6/9) * (1/2) / (47/108) = 36/47 Given a red ball, the likelihood that the urn with 6 red balls was chosen is 36/47.
