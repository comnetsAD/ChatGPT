R1 is when the urn with 6 red balls is chosen, and R is when a red ball is drawn. Find P(R1|R). Bayes' theorem: P(R1|R) = P(R|R1) * P(R1)/P. (R) P(R1) is 1/2 for choosing the urn with 6 red balls. Red ball probability is (6/9 + 5/13)/2 = 31/52. Given the urn with 6 red balls, P(R|R1) is 6/9. Using the formula above, P(R1|R) = (6/9) * (1/2) / (31/52) = 12/31. Given a red ball, the probability of choosing the urn with 6 red balls is 12/31.
