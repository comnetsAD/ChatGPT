Since the difference of two sets, commonly known as the set difference, is defined as the set of elements that are in the first set but not in the second set, we can use this knowledge to show that A (B C) = (A B) (A C). First, let's work on the left side of the equation by making it bigger: (A B)(A C) = (A x)(B x)(C x) Since we know that the set of elements that are in both sets B and C is called the intersection of these two sets, we can rewrite the statement as: A (B C) = x | x A x B x C Now the right side of the equation can be developed further: (A B)(A C) = (x A)(x B)(x C) Simplifying this using the notion of the intersection of two sets yields:
