We can use the definition of set difference to back up this claim. We have the following for any of the sets A, B, and C: A + (B + C) = x | x A and x (B + C) And (A B) (A C) = x | x A and x B x | x A and x B x | x A and x C To demonstrate that these two expressions are equivalent, we must show that x A (B C) if and only if x (A B) (A C). Assume that x A (B C). This means that x A and x (B C) are equivalent. Because x A, it follows that x (A B) and x (A C). As a result, x (A B) (A C). Consider the case where x (A B) (A C). This means that x A, x B, and x C. Because x B and x C, it follows that x (B C). As a result, x A (B C). We have demonstrated that x A (B C) if and only if x (A B) (A C), which means that A (B C) = (A B) (A C).
