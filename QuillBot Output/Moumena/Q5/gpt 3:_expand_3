We can utilize the definition of set difference as the basis for our proof of this argument. We have the following for any sets of A, B, and C: A − (B ∩ C) = {x | x ∈ A and x ∉ (B ∩ C)} And the equation for the difference between (A B) and (A C) is: (x | x A and x B) = (x | x A and x C) To demonstrate that these two expressions have the same value, we need to show that x A (B C) if and only if x (A B) (A C). This will allow us to demonstrate that these two expressions are equivalent. Let's say that x > A > (B > C). This indicates that x is greater than A and x is less than (B C). Given that x is more than A, it follows that x is greater than both (A B) and (A C). Therefore, x is equivalent to (A B) (A C). On the other hand, suppose that x = (A - B) (A - C). This indicates that x is greater than A as well as B and C. It follows that x is greater than (B C) given that x is greater than both B and C. As a result, x must be greater than (B or C). We have demonstrated that x is less than or equal to A if and only if x is less than or equal to (A B) (A C), which indicates that A (B C) = (A B) (A C).
