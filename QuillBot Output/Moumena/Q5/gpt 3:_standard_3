We can use the definition of set difference to demonstrate this claim. We have: For any set A, B, or C. A + (B + C) = x | A + (B + C) = x And (A B) (A C) = (A B) (A C) (x | x A and x B) (x | x A and x C) In order to demonstrate the equality of these two expressions, we must demonstrate that x A (B C) if and only if x (A B) (A C). Assume that x = A + (B + C). As a result, x A and x (B C). As a result of x A, x (A B) and x (A C) also follow. Consequently, x = (A B) (A C). On the other hand, imagine that x (A B) (A C). This implies that x = A, B, and C. It follows that x (B C) because x B and x C. Consequently, x = (A + B + C). A (B C) = (A B) (A C) is the result of our demonstration that x A (B C) if and only if x (A B) (A C).
