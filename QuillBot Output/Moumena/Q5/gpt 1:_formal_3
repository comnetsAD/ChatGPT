To demonstrate that A (B C) = (A B) (A C), we can use set notation to demonstrate that the two sets contain the same members. To accomplish this, we must demonstrate that x A (B C) if and only if x (A B) (A C). Let's first assume that x A (B C). This indicates that x is not present in B C. Since x does not appear in B C, it cannot appear in either B or C. Therefore, because x A B and x A C, x (A B) (A C). Let us now assume that x (A B) (A C). This demonstrates that x A B and x A C. Since x is not present in both B and C, it cannot be present in B C. Therefore, since x is not present in B C, x A (B C). We have proven that A (B C) = (A B) (A C) as we have established that x A (B C) if and only if x (A B) (A C).
