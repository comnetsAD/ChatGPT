To prove that A − (B x C) = (A − B) x (A − C), we can utilize the set difference, which is the set of elements in the first set that are not in the second set. First, extend the left half of the equation: A − (B & C) = A − (x | B & C) Since the intersection of two sets B and C is the set of elements in both sets, we can rewrite the equation as: A − (B & C) = {x | x A B C}. Expanding the equation's right side: (A − B) & (A − C) = {x | x A x B} & {x | x A x C}. The intersection of two sets simplifies this to:
