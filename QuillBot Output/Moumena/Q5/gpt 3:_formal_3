To demonstrate this, we can employ the definition of set difference. We have for all sets A, B, and C: A − (B ∩ C) = {x | x ∈ A and x ∉ (B ∩ C)} Moreover, (A B) (A C) = x | x A and x B x | x A and x C To demonstrate that these two expressions are equivalent, we must demonstrate that x A (B C) if and only if x (A B) (A C). Assume that x A (B C). Thus, x is greater than A and less than (B C). Since x A, x (A B) and x (A C) must also be true. Consequently, x (A B) (A C). In contrast, imagine x (A B) (A C). This implies that x is greater than A, B, and C. Since x is less than B and greater than C, it follows that x is less than (B C). Consequently, x A (B C). We have demonstrated that x A (B C) if and only if x (A B) (A C), hence A (B C) = (A B) (A C).
