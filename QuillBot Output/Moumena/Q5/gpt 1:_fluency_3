To demonstrate that A (B C) = (A B) (A C), we can use set notation to demonstrate that the two sets are equal by demonstrating that they contain the same elements. To accomplish this, we must demonstrate that x A (B C) if and only if x (A B) (A C). Let us first suppose that x A (B C). This means that x A, but not x in B C. Because x is not in B C, it must not be in either B or C. As a result, x A B and x A C equal x (A B) (A C). Let us now suppose that x (A B) (A C). This implies that x A B and x A C. Because x is not in B and is not in C, it cannot be in B C. As a result, x A and x are not in B C, so x A (B C). We have proven that A (B C) = (A B) (A C) because we demonstrated that x A (B C) if and only if x (A B) (A C).
