We can use the fact that the difference of two sets, also known as the set difference, is defined as the set of elements that are in the first set but not in the second set to prove that A (B C) = (A B) (A C). To begin, let us expand the left side of the equation: A x | x B x C = A x | x B x C Because the intersection of two sets B and C is defined as the set of elements in both sets B and C, we can rewrite the expression as follows: A (B C) = x | x A x B x C A x B x C The right side of the equation can now be expanded: (A B) (A C) = x | x A x B x | x A x C x | x A x C This can be simplified using the definition of the intersection of two sets:
