Using the definition of set difference, we can show that this is true. Here we have, for all sets A, B, and C: The formula A (B C) = (x | x A and (x (B C)) Also, (A B) (A C) = (x | x A and x B) (x | x A and x C) To prove their equality, we need to show that if and only if x (A B) (A C), then x A (B C). Let's pretend x > (B > C). As a result, we can deduce that x (B C) and x A. Theorem: Since x A, therefore x (A B) and x (A C). For this reason, we can write x = (A B) (A C). Let's flip that over and say x > (A B) > (A C). This implies that x is equal to A, B, and C. Since both B and C are integers, it follows that x (B C). As a result, x = (B C). Given that A (B C) = (A B) (A C), we have proved that if and only if x A (B C), then A (B C).
