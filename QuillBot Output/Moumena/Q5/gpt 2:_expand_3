We can use the fact that the difference of two sets, also known as the set difference, is defined as the set of elements that are in the first set but are not in the second set to prove that A (B C) = (A B) (A C). This can be done by using the fact that the set difference is defined as the set of elements that are in the first set but are not in the second set. To begin, let's make the left side of the equation a little bit bigger: A − (B ∩ C) = A − {x | x ∈ B ∧ x ∈ C} We are able to rephrase the statement as follows because the intersection of two sets, B and C, is understood to be the collection of items that are present in both of those sets. A − (B ∩ C) = {x | x ∈ A ∧ x ∉ B ∧ x ∉ C} Now we are able to broaden the scope of the right side of the equation: (A − B) ∩ (A − C) = {x | x ∈ A ∧ x ∉ B} ∩ {x | x ∈ A ∧ x ∉ C} The following is a simplified version of this, using the definition of the intersection of two sets as a guide:
