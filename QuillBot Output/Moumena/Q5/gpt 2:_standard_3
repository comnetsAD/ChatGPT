We may utilize the definition of the set difference, also known as the difference of two sets, which is defined as the set of items that are in the first set but not in the second set, to demonstrate that A (B C) = (A B) (A C). Expanding the left side of the equation first will help: A = (B + C) = A x | x = (B + C) We can rephrase the equation as: Since the intersection of two sets B and C is defined as the set of elements that are in both sets B and C. A x (B x C) = x | A x (B x C) = x Now that the right side of the equation has been expanded: (A x B x (A x C)) = x | x | x A x B x (A x C) This can be condensed to: using the definition of the intersection of two sets.
