Set difference can verify this. We have: A − (B & C) = {x | A and (B & C)}. And (A − B) Equals (A − C). We must prove that x = A − (B x C) if and only if x = (A − B) x (A − C). Suppose x = A − (B & C). This means x is A and (B - C). Since x is A, x is (A − B) and (A − C). Thus, (A − B) x (A − C). Alternatively, x = (A − B) x (A − C). x is A, B, and C, respectively. Since x is B and C, x is (B x C). Thus, x = A − (B x C). We showed that x!= A − (B & C) if and only if x = (A − B)!= (A − C).
