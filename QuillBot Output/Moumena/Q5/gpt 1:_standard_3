By demonstrating that the two sets contain the same elements, we may use set notation to demonstrate that A (B C) = (A B) (A C). In order to accomplish this, we must demonstrate that x A (B C) if and only if x (A B) (A C). Let's start by assuming that x A (B C). It follows that x A but that x is not in B C. Because x is not in B C, it cannot be in either B or C. As a result, x (A B) (A C) and x (A C) (x A B). Let's now assume that x (A B) (A C). As a result, x A B and x A C. Since x isn't in either B or C, it can't be in B + C. Because x is not in B & C, it follows that x A (B & C). We have established that A (B C) = (A B) (A C) because we showed that x A (B C) if and only if x (A B) (A C).
