Set notation can demonstrate that A − (B x C) = (A − B) x (A − C) by showing that the two sets contain the same elements. To prove this, we must show that x is A − (B x C) if and only if it is (A − B). Let x = A − (B - C). x satisfies A but neither B or C. Since x is not in B x C, it cannot be in B or C. Thus, x : (A − B) : (A − C). Let x be (A − B) x (A − C). x is A − B and A − C. x is neither in B or C, hence it cannot be in B x C. Thus, x − (B - C) = A. We demonstrated that A − (B x C) = (A − B) x (A − C) by showing that x is A if and only if it is A minus B.
