To demonstrate that A (B C) = (A B) (A C), we can use the fact that the difference of two sets, commonly known as the set difference, is the set of elements that are in the first set but not the second. First, we can expand the left side of the equation: A − (B ∩ C) = A − {x | x ∈ B ∧ x ∈ C} The expression can be rewritten as: A − (B ∩ C) = {x | x ∈ A ∧ x ∉ B ∧ x ∉ C} Now we can increase the right-hand side of the equation: (A − B) ∩ (A − C) = {x | x ∈ A ∧ x ∉ B} ∩ {x | x ∈ A ∧ x ∉ C} This can be reduced using the definition of the intersection of two sets to:
