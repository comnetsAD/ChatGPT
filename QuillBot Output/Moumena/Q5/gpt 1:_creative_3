Using set notation, we can demonstrate that A (B C) = (A B) (A C) because the two sets contain the same items. First, we must establish that if and only if x (A B) (A C), then x A (B C). Let's start with the assumption that x A (B C). If x is not in B C, then x is not equal to A. Since x is outside of B C, it follows that x does not belong to either B or C. As a result, since x A B and x A C, then x (A B) (A C). Let's assume for the moment that x = (A B) (A C). To put it another way, x A B and x A C. If x isn't in either B or C, then it can't be in B C. Since x does not belong to B or C, we might conclude that x A (B or C). We have established that A (B C) = (A B) (A C) by demonstrating that if and only if x A (B C), then A (B C).
