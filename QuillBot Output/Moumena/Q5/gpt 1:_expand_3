We can use set notation to demonstrate that the two sets are equivalent by demonstrating that they include the same items in order to demonstrate that A (B C) = (A B) (A C). This will allow us to prove that A (B C) = (A C). In order to accomplish this, we will have to demonstrate that x A (B C) if and only if x (A B) (A C). Let's begin by supposing that x is more than A than (B greater than C). This indicates that x is superior to A, but x is not superior to B or C. Since x does not appear in B > C, we can conclude that it does not appear in either B or C. Since x implies A > B and x implies A > C, we can deduce that x implies (A > B) > (A > C). Let's say for the sake of argument that x = (A B) (A C). In light of this, we can deduce that x > A > B and x > A > C. Since x does not appear in either B or C, we can conclude that it does not appear in the combination B > C. Because of this, x belongs to A, and since x does not belong to B or C, x belongs to A more than (B or C). Since we have demonstrated that x is greater than or equal to A if and only if x is greater than or equal to (A B) (A C), we have demonstrated that A (B C) = (A B) (A C).
