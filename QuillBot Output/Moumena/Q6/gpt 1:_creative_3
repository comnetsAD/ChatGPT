Finding the minimum number of lockers that each student can have will reveal the maximum number of students that will have to share a locker. Calculate the ratio of students to lockers by using the following formula: Taking into account all 4026 students, there are a total of 805 lockers, or 0.2 lockers per student. Because no student can have less than a full locker, the minimum number of lockers that any one student can have is 1. Consequently, the greatest possible number of students who will have to share a locker is the difference between the entire number of students and the total number of lockers. There are 3221 pupils since there are 4026 less people than there are lockers.
