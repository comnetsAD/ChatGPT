To find the maximum number of students who must share a locker, find the smallest number of lockers that each student can have. Divide the number of lockers by the number of students to arrive at this figure: 805 lockers divided by 4026 students equals 0.2 lockers per student. Because no student can have a fraction of a locker, the smallest number of lockers each student can have is one. As a result, the total number of students minus the number of lockers equals the maximum number of students who must necessarily share a locker: 4026 students minus 805 lockers equals 4026-805=3221 students.
