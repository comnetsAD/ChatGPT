Find out how many lockers each student is allowed to have, then multiply that number by the maximum number of pupils in the class to get the maximum number of students that are required to share a locker. To accomplish this, divide the total number of pupils by the number of lockers available: 805 lockers / 4026 students = 0.2 lockers/student. Because it is impossible for a student to have a portion of a locker, the least amount of storage space that a student can have is one locker. Since there are fewer lockers than there are students, the number of students who must necessarily share a locker is equal to the difference between the total number of students and the number of lockers: 4026 pupils - 805 lockers = 4026-805=3221 => 3221 students.
