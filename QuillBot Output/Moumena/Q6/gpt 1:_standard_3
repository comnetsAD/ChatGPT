Find the least number of lockers each student can have in order to calculate the maximum number of students who will unavoidably share a locker. Divide the number of lockers by the total number of pupils to achieve this: 4026 students / 805 lockers equals 0.2 lockers per student. Each student is only permitted to have one locker since they are not permitted to share lockers. As a result, the highest number of students who must share a locker is equal to the total student population less the number of lockers: 4026 pupils minus 805 lockers equals 4026-805 = 3221 students, or 3221 total.
