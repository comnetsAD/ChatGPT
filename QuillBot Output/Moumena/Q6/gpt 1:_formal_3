To establish the maximum number of students that must share a locker, the least number of lockers that each student can have must be determined. Divide the number of lockers by the number of pupils to do this: 805 lockers / 4026 students = 0.2 lockers/student. Since a student cannot have a fraction of a locker, the minimum number of lockers he or she can have is 1. Consequently, the greatest number of students who must share a locker equals the difference between the total number of students and the number of lockers. 4026 pupils - 805 lockers = 4026-805=3221 => 3221 students.
