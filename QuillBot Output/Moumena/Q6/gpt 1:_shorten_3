Find the minimum number of lockers each student can have to find the highest number of students who must share. Divide lockers by students: 0.2 lockers/student. Since students can't have fractions of lockers, they can only have one. Thus, the highest number of students who must share a locker is the total number minus the number of lockers: 3221 students = 4026 minus 805 lockers.
