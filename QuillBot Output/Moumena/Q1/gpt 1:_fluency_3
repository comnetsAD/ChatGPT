To begin solving this problem, we can use the congruence equation: The terms can then be rearranged to yield: a + 1 - 2a ≡ 0 mod 11 This boils down to: -a + 1 ≡ 0 mod 11 Then we divide both sides of the equation by -1, yielding: a -1 mod 11 We want to find the smallest integer value of a that satisfies this congruence because an is an integer. To accomplish this, we can add 11 to both sides of the equation, yielding: a ≡ 10 mod 11 Then we add 11 to both sides once more to get: a 21 mod 11 We can keep adding 11 to both sides until we find the smallest integer value of a that is congruent. a ≡ 32 mod 11\sa ≡ 43 mod 11\sa ≡ 54 mod 11\sa ≡ 65 mod 11\sa ≡ 76 mod 11\sa ≡ 87 mod 11\sa ≡ 98 mod 11 The congruence is satisfied by the smallest integer value of a, which is 98.
