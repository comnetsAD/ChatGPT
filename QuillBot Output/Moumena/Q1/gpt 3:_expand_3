To begin resolving this issue, we can begin by formulating the congruence that is being offered in terms of modular arithmetic: a + 1 ≡ 2a mod 11 a + 1 - 2a ≡ 0 mod 11\s-a + 1 ≡ 0 mod 11 After that, we can find the answer by dividing both sides by -1 as follows: a ≡ -1 mod 11 In the end, we may get the smallest integer solution by adding 11 to both sides of the equation: a ≡ 10 mod 11 Therefore, 10 is the least significant integer that is more than one and satisfies the stated congruence.
