Set up the congruence equation to answer this problem: 2a mod 11 Rearranging the phrases yields: + 1 - 2a = 0 mod 11 Simple: -a + 1 ≡ 0 mod 11 We can divide both sides by -1 to get: a - -1 mod 11. Since an is integer, we seek the smallest integer value that satisfies this congruence. Add 11 to both sides of the equation to get: a ≡ 10 mod 11 We can add 11 to both sides again to get: a mod 21 Add 11 to both sides until we discover the smallest integer value of a that fulfills the congruence. a ≡ 32 mod 11\sa ≡ 43 mod 11\sa ≡ 54 mod 11\sa ≡ 65 mod 11\sa ≡ 76 mod 11\sa ≡ 87 mod 11\sa ≡ 98 mod 11 The congruence requires a minimum integer value of 98.
