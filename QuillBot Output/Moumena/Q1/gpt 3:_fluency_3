To begin solving this problem, we can express the given congruence in terms of modular arithmetic: a + 1 ≡ 2a mod 11 a + 1 - 2a ≡ 0 mod 11\s-a + 1 ≡ 0 mod 11 Then we divide both sides by -1 to obtain: a ≡ -1 mod 11 Finally, to find the smallest integer solution, we can add 11 to both sides: a ≡ 10 mod 11 As a result, the smallest integer a > 1 satisfying the given congruence is 10.
