We can begin by setting up the congruence equation to tackle this issue: a + 1 ≡ 2a mod 11 The terms can then be rearranged to yield: a + 1 - 2a ≡ 0 mod 11 That amounts to: -a + 1 ≡ 0 mod 11 The result is: a -1 mod 11 after dividing both sides of the equation by -1. Finding the smallest integer value of a that fulfills this congruence is important since an is an integer. To do this, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 11, which gives us: a ≡ 10 mod 11 Then, by adding 11 to both sides once more, we arrive at: a 21 mod 11. Up until the smallest integer value of a that satisfies the congruence, we can keep adding 11 to both sides. a ≡ 32 mod 11\sa ≡ 43 mod 11\sa ≡ 54 mod 11\sa ≡ 65 mod 11\sa ≡ 76 mod 11\sa ≡ 87 mod 11\sa ≡ 98 mod 11 The congruence can be satisfied by the smallest integer value of a, which is 98.
