To determine the smallest positive number a > 1 such that a + 1 2a mod 11, we can begin by setting a = 2 and verifying that the equation holds. If the condition is not met, we can increase a by one and check again until we discover an a that works. We have: 2 + 1 2 * 2 mod 11 for a = 2 3 ≡ 4 mod 11 Since 3 and 4 modulo 11 are not congruent, we must try the next value of a. We have: 3 + 1 2 * 3 mod 11 for a = 3. 4 ≡ 6 mod 11 Since 4 and 6 modulo 11 are not congruent, we must try the next value of a. We have: 4 + 1 2 * 4 mod 11 for a = 4. 5 ≡ 8 mod 11 Since 5 and 8 modulo 11 are not congruent, we must try the next value of a. We have: 5 + 1 2 * 5 mod 11 for a = 5. 6 ≡ 10 mod 11 Since 6 and 10 modulo 11 are not congruent, we must try the next value of a. We have: 6 + 1 2 * 6 mod 11 for a = 6 7 ≡ 0 mod 11 Since 7 is equivalent to 0 modulo 11, this is the lowest positive integer satisfying the equation a > 1. The answer is therefore a = 6.
