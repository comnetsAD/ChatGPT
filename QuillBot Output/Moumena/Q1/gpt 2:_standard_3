By setting a = 2 and determining whether the equation holds, we may begin the process of determining the smallest integer a > 1 such that a + 1 2a mod 11. If it is not, we can increase a by 1, check again, and so on until we discover an a that is effective. We have the following for a = 2: 2 + 1 2 * 2 mod 3 ≡ 4 mod 11 We must try the following value of a because 3 is not congruent to 4 modulo 11. We have the following for a = 3: 3 + 1 2 * 3 mod 4 ≡ 6 mod 11 We must try the following value of a because 4 is not congruent to 6 modulo 11. We have the following for a = 4: 4 + 1 2 * 4 mod 11. 5 ≡ 8 mod 11 We must try the following value of a because 5 is not congruent to 8 modulo 11. Here are the results for a = 5: 5 + 1 2 * 5 mod 6 ≡ 10 mod 11 We must try the following value of a because 6 is not equivalent to 10 modulo 11. We have the following for a = 6: 6 + 1 2 * 6 mod 7 ≡ 0 mod 11 This is the smallest integer a > 1 that solves the equation because 7 is equivalent to 0 modulo 11. As a result, the solution is a = 6.
