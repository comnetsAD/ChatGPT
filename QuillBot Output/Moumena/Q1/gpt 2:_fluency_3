To find the smallest integer a > 1 such that a + 1 2a mod 11 is satisfied, we can start with a = 2 and see if the equation is satisfied. If it is not satisfied, we can increase a by one and try again until we find an a that works. We have: 2 + 1 2 * 2 mod 11 for a = 2. 3 ≡ 4 mod 11 Because 3 is not congruent to 4 modulo 11, we must try a different value of a. We have 3 + 1 2 * 3 mod 11 for a = 3. 4 ≡ 6 mod 11 Because 4 is not congruent to 6 modulo 11, we must try a different value of a. We have 4 + 1 2 * 4 mod 11 for a = 4. 5 ≡ 8 mod 11 Because 5 is not congruent to 8 modulo 11, we must try a different value of a. We have: 5 + 1 2 * 5 mod 11 for a = 5. 6 ≡ 10 mod 11 Because 6 is not congruent to 10 modulo 11, we must try a different value of a. We have: 6 + 1 2 * 6 mod 11 for a = 6. 7 ≡ 0 mod 11 Because 7 is congruent to 0 modulo 11, it is the smallest integer a > 1 that fulfills the equation. As a result, the answer is a = 6.
