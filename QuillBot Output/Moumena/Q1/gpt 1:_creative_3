First, we can write down the congruence equation needed to solve this problem: a + 1 ≡ 2a mod 11 If we rearrange the terms, we obtain a + 1 - 2a ≡ 0 mod 11 So, to put it simply: -a + 1 ≡ 0 mod 11 Once we do that, we get a -1 mod 11 by dividing both sides by -1. Since a can only take on integer values, we are looking for the smallest possible value of a that still conforms to this condition. By adding 11 to both sides of the equation, we obtain a ≡ 10 mod 11 Then, we can once again add 11 to both sides to obtain: a 21 mod 11. To discover the smallest integer value of a such that the congruence holds, we can simply keep adding 11 to both sides. a ≡ 32 mod 11\sa ≡ 43 mod 11\sa ≡ 54 mod 11\sa ≡ 65 mod 11\sa ≡ 76 mod 11\sa ≡ 87 mod 11\sa ≡ 98 mod 11 For this congruence, the smallest integer value of an is 98.
