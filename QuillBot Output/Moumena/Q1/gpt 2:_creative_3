Setting a = 2 and seeing if the equation is satisfied is the first step in finding the smallest integer a > 1 such that a + 1 2a mod 11. If this condition is not met, we can try increasing a by one and seeing if that helps, and so on. With a=2, we get 2 + 1 2 * 2 mod 11. 3 ≡ 4 mod 11 We need to test the next value of a since 3 is not equal to 4 modulo 11. Given a value of 3, we get: 3 + 1 2 * 3 mod 11 4 ≡ 6 mod 11 If we want to find a value of a that is congruent to 6 modulo 11, we need to try a different one than 4. We can write this in terms of a = 4 as: (a + 1)(2 * a + 1)(a - 1)(a - 5 ≡ 8 mod 11 Given that 5 does not equal 8 modulo 11, we must try another number for a. The formula for a=5 is: 5 + 1 2 * 5 mod 11. 6 ≡ 10 mod 11 Since 6 does not equal 10 modulo 11, we must continue searching for a value of a that does. With a=6, we get 6 + 1 2 * 6 mod 11. 7 ≡ 0 mod 11 Since 7 = 0 modulo 11, it's the smallest number a > 1 that fulfills the equation. Therefore, a = 6 is the correct solution.
