To resolve this issue, we can begin by establishing the congruence equation: a + 1 ≡ 2a mod 11 Then, rearranging the terms yields: a + 1 - 2a ≡ 0 mod 11 This boils down to: -a + 1 ≡ 0 mod 11 Then, we can divide both sides by -1 to obtain: a -1 modulo 11 Since an is an integer, we seek the smallest integer value of a satisfying this congruence. To accomplish this, we can add 11 to both sides of the equation, resulting in: a ≡ 10 mod 11 Then, we may again add 11 to both sides to obtain: a 21 mod 11 Continue adding 11 to both sides until the smallest integer value of a that fulfills the congruence is found. a ≡ 32 mod 11\sa ≡ 43 mod 11\sa ≡ 54 mod 11\sa ≡ 65 mod 11\sa ≡ 76 mod 11\sa ≡ 87 mod 11\sa ≡ 98 mod 11 98 is the least integer value of a that is compatible with the congruence.
