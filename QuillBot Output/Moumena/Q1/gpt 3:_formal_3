To tackle this issue, we can begin by expressing the provided congruence using modular arithmetic: a + 1 ≡ 2a mod 11 a + 1 - 2a ≡ 0 mod 11\s-a + 1 ≡ 0 mod 11 Then, dividing both sides by -1 yields: a ≡ -1 mod 11 We can finally obtain the smallest integer solution by adding 11 to both sides. a ≡ 10 mod 11 The smallest positive integer a > 1 satisfying the specified congruence is therefore 10.
