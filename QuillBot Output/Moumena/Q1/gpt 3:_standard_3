We can begin by stating the given congruence in terms of modular arithmetic in order to answer this problem: a + 1 ≡ 2a mod 11 a + 1 - 2a ≡ 0 mod 11\s-a + 1 ≡ 0 mod 11 Then, by dividing both sides by -1, we obtain: a ≡ -1 mod 11 Finally, to obtain the smallest integer solution, we can add 11 to both sides: a ≡ 10 mod 11 As a result, 10 is the lowest number a > 1 that meets the specified congruence.
