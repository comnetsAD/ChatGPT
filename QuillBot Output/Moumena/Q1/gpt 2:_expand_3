To begin our search for the smallest integer a greater than 1 that satisfies the condition that a + 1 2a mod 11, we can begin by putting an equal to 2 and determining whether or not the equation is met. If the condition is not met, we can raise a by one and try again; this process can be repeated as often as necessary until we locate a value for a that is valid. Given that an equals 2, we get: 2 plus 1 less than 2 times 2 modulo 11 3 ≡ 4 mod 11 Because the number 3 does not correspond to the value 4 modulo 11, we need to proceed to the next possible value of a. Given that an equals 3, we get: 3 plus 1 minus 2 times 3 modulo 11 4 ≡ 6 mod 11 Because the number 4 does not correspond to the value 6 modulo 11, we need to proceed to the next possible value of a. 5 ≡ 8 mod 11 Given that an equals 5, we get: 5 plus 1 minus 2 times 5 modulo 11 6 ≡ 10 mod 11 7 ≡ 0 mod 11
