Set a = 2 and check the equation to find the smallest integer a > 1 such that a + 1 < 2a mod 11. If not, increment a by 1 and check again until we discover a that works. 2 + 1 Equals 2 * 2 mod 11 for a=2. 3 ≡ 4 mod 11 Since 3 is not congruent to 4 modulo 11, we must try the next value of a. 3 + 1 mod 11 = 3 4 ≡ 6 mod 11 Since 4 is not congruent to 6 modulo 11, we must try the next value of a. 4 + 1 mod 11 = 4 5 ≡ 8 mod 11 5 is not congruent to 8 modulo 11, so we must try the next value of a. 5 + 1 mod 11 for a = 5. 6 ≡ 10 mod 11 Since 6 is not congruent to 10 modulo 11, we must try the next value of a. 6 + 1 mod 11 = 6 7 ≡ 0 mod 11 7 is equivalent to 0 modulo 11, making it the smallest number a > 1 that solves the equation. Thus, a=6.
