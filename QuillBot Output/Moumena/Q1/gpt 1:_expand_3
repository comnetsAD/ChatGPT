To begin resolving this issue, we can begin by formulating the congruence equation as follows: The following is a rearranged version of the terms: -a + 1 ≡ 0 mod 11 Then, we may find the solution to the equation by dividing both sides by -1 to get: a -1 mod 11 a ≡ 10 mod 11 After that, we can once more add 11 to both sides to arrive at the following result: a 21 mod 11. a ≡ 32 mod 11\sa ≡ 43 mod 11\sa ≡ 54 mod 11\sa ≡ 65 mod 11\sa ≡ 76 mod 11\sa ≡ 87 mod 11\sa ≡ 98 mod 11
