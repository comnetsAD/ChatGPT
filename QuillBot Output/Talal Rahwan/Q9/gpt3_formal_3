Linked lists may expand and contract in size as required, while arrays have a fixed size once established. This increases the use of linked lists in situations where the quantity of data to be kept is unknown or susceptible to change. Ease of insertion and deletion: In a linked list, inserting or deleting an element is as easy as changing a few pointers, but in an array, it is sometimes necessary to move all the entries following the insertion or deletion point. This makes linked lists more efficient in situations with many insertions and removals.
