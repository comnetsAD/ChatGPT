Dynamic size: Because memory may be allocated and released while a program is running, linked lists can readily and dynamically change in size. This is helpful when a data structure's size needs to fluctuate a lot or isn't known in advance. Effective insertion and deletion: Inserting or removing an element from a linked list just requires a few pointer changes, however doing the same with an array may involve moving a lot of data around in memory, making the process more costly.
