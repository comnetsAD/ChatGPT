Arrays have a fixed size, while linked lists may grow and decrease. This makes linked lists more effective when data storage is unknown or prone to change. Easy insertion and deletion: In a linked list, adding or deleting an element needs altering a few pointers, but in an array, it typically requires shifting all the entries following the insertion or deletion point. This improves linked lists for frequent insertions and removals.
