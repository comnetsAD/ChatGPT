Linked-lists may have their sizes simply and dynamically adjusted during runtime since memory can be allocated and deallocated at any point in the process. This is helpful in situations in which the size of a data structure must be altered regularly or in which the size cannot be determined in advance. Efficient insertion and deletion: Linked-lists offer efficient insertion and deletion operations because only a few pointers need to be changed in order to add or remove an element from the list. On the other hand, arrays can be expensive for these operations because they may require shifting a large amount of data in memory. Linked-lists offer more efficient insertion and deletion operations.
