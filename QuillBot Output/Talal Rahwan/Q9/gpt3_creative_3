Linked lists may expand or contract in size as required, but arrays remain static in size once constructed. This increases the use of linked lists in situations when the total quantity of data to be kept is uncertain or susceptible to variation. Adding and deleting items from a linked list needs just changing a small number of pointers, but doing the same in an array sometimes necessitates relocating all the items after the insertion or deletion point. This improves the performance of linked lists in situations when many insertions and deletions are expected.
