Linked lists have the ability to increase or decrease in size depending on the requirements, while arrays have a predetermined size once they have been established. Because of this, the utility of linked lists is increased in circumstances in which the quantity of data that will be kept is either not known in advance or is prone to change. Ease of insertion and deletion: In a linked list, adding or deleting an element is as easy as changing a few pointers, but in an array, it typically involves shifting all of the entries following the insertion or deletion point. This makes the process of adding or removing elements much simpler. In circumstances in which there will be a significant number of insertions or deletions, linked lists become more effective as a result of this.
