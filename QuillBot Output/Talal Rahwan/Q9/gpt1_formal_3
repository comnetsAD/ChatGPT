Size variation: Because Linked Lists are dynamic data structures, their size might fluctuate during runtime. This implies that memory allocation may occur while the program executes, making applications that often add and delete items more efficient. Arrays need shifting all items after the insertion or deletion point, but Linked Lists just require modifying the pointers of the surrounding elements when adding and removing entries from the center of the list.
