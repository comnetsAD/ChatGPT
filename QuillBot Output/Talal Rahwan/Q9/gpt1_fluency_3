Linked Lists are dynamic data structures, which implies their size may vary during execution. This implies that memory allocation may happen while the application is running, making it more efficient for programs that need to add or delete items regularly. Linked Lists are far more efficient than arrays in inserting and deleting items from the center of the list because it just needs changing the pointers of the surrounding members, while arrays require shifting all elements after the insertion or deletion point.
