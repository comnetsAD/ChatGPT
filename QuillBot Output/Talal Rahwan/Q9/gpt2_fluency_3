Dynamic size: Because memory may be allocated and deallocated during runtime, linked-lists can be enlarged quickly and dynamically. This is helpful when the size of a data structure must vary regularly or is unknown ahead of time. Efficient insertion and deletion: Because only a few pointers need to be updated to add or remove an element from the list, linked-lists allow efficient insertion and deletion operations, but arrays may be costly because they may involve changing a significant amount of data in memory.
