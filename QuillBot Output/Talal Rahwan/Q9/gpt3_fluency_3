Linked lists may expand and decrease in size as required, while arrays have a fixed size once generated. This makes linked lists more helpful in situations where the quantity of data to be kept is unknown or subject to change. Ease of insertion and deletion: Adding or deleting an element in a linked list is as easy as changing a few pointers, while relocating all the members following the insertion or deletion point in an array is often required. This makes linked lists more efficient when there will be a large number of insertions or deletions.
