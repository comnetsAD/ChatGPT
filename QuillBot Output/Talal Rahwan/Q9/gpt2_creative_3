Since memory may be allocated and deallocated at runtime, linked-lists can have their sizes changed on the fly. This is helpful when the size of a data structure is unpredictable or needs to vary regularly. In contrast to arrays, where inserting and removing elements may be time-consuming and resource-intensive tasks, linked-lists' insertion and deletion procedures are fast and need only minor adjustments to the list's pointers.
