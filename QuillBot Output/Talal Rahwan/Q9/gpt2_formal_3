Linked-lists may be simply and dynamically enlarged, since memory can be allocated and deallocated at runtime. This is helpful when the size of a data structure must be altered regularly or is unknown beforehand. Linked-lists allow efficient insertion and deletion operations since only a few pointers need to be updated in order to add or remove an element from the list, while arrays may involve changing a significant amount of data in memory, making these operations costly.
