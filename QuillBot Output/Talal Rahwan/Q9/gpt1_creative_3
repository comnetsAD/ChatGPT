The size of a linked list might vary at runtime since linked lists are dynamic data structures. Therefore, applications that often add or delete parts may benefit from dynamic memory allocation as they run. Effective inserts and deletes: Linked Lists are superior than arrays in this regard since adding and removing items from the center of the list just involves shifting the pointers of the adjacent elements, whereas arrays require shifting all members after the insertion or deletion point.
