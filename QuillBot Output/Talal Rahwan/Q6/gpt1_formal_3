Without explicit function overloading or type casting, function templates in C++ enable the same function to operate with numerous data types. This allows a single function template to operate on a variety of data types, making the code more reusable and decreasing the amount of code that must be developed. In addition, function templates enable more efficient code execution since, at compile time, the compiler builds a tailored version of the function for each data type utilized. This avoids the overhead of type verification and casting at runtime.
