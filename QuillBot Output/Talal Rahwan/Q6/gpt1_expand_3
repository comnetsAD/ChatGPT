The C++ feature known as function templates provide the benefit of genericity by making it possible for a single function to deal with many different data types without the requirement for explicit function overloading or type casting. Because of this, a single function template may be used to perform operations on a broad variety of data types. This makes the code more reusable and reduces the amount of code that has to be created, both of which are positive outcomes. In addition, function templates make it possible for code to be executed more quickly by enabling the compiler to create a unique version of the function at the time of compilation that is tailored to each data type that is being utilized. Runtime type checking and type casting are no longer necessary as a result of this change.
