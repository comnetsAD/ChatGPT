C++ function templates enable generic functions to operate on numerous data types. This facilitates code reuse and lowers the requirement for data type-specific methods. Eliminating type-specific function names improves readability and maintainability. This reduces repetition and optimizes code. It also lets the compiler construct type-specific functions at compile time, improving program efficiency. Container classes and other data structures that interact with different object types benefit from function templates.
