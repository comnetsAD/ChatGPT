Generic functions that can work with many forms of data may be created using function templates in C++. The benefit of this is that it eliminates the need to write distinct functions for each data type and promotes code reuse. By doing away with the necessity for type-specific function names, it also improves the readability and maintainability of the code. This enables less redundant, more efficient code. Additionally, it gives the compiler the ability to produce type-specific functions at build time, which may enhance program performance. When dealing with container classes and other data structures that must handle many sorts of objects, function templates are very helpful.
