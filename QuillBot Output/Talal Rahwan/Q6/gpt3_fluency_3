C++ function templates enable the construction of generic functions that may operate on a variety of data types. This has the benefit of allowing code reusability and reducing the need to write distinct functions for each data type. It also improves code readability and maintainability by removing the requirement for type-specific function names. This enables more efficient coding with less duplication. It also allows the compiler to build type-specific functions at compile time, which may increase program speed. When dealing with container classes and other data structures that must interact with many sorts of objects, function templates come in handy.
