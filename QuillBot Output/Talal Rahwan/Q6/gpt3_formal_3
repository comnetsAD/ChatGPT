C++ function templates provide the construction of generic functions that may operate on a variety of data types. This has the benefit of allowing code reuse and reducing the need to write distinct functions for each data type. In addition, it improves the readability and maintainability of the code by removing the requirement for type-specific function names. This enables for more efficient and redundant code. Additionally, it allows the compiler to build type-specific functions at compile time, which may enhance the efficiency of the application. When dealing with container classes and other data structures that must operate with different sorts of objects, function templates are very beneficial.
