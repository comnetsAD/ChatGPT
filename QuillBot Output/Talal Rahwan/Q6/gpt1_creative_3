C++'s function templates provide the benefit of genericity since they may be used with different data types without any explicit function overloading or type casting. The ability to utilize a single function template across many data types improves code reuse and reduces the total amount of code required. As the compiler creates a variant of the function at build time that is optimized for each data type, using function templates may result in more efficient code execution. This removes the need for time-consuming type verification and type casting at runtime.
