Genericity allows C++ function templates to interact with numerous data types without function overloading or type casting. This makes code more reusable and reduces code by allowing a single function template to work on several data types. At compile time, function templates produce a tailored function for each data type, making code execution more efficient. Runtime type verification and casting are eliminated.
