C++'s function templates feature makes it easy to write generic functions that can process a wide variety of data types. This has the benefit of facilitating code reuse and decreasing the need to create unique functions for each data type. Further, not having to use function names that are unique to a certain data type improves code readability and maintainability. This paves the way for more streamlined, redundant-code solutions. Compiler performance may be enhanced by having type-specific functions generated at compile time. If you're dealing with a class that must manage many object types, like a container or a data structure, function templates will be invaluable to you.
