Genericity is provided through function templates in C++, which allows the same function to operate with numerous data types without the requirement for explicit function overloading or type casting. This implies that a single function template may be used to operate on a variety of data types, making the code more reusable and lowering the amount of code required. Furthermore, function templates enable for more efficient code execution since the compiler builds a tailored version of the function at compile time for each data type utilized. This avoids the overhead of type checking and type casting at runtime.
