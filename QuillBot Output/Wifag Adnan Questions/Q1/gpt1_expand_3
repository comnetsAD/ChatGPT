False. The gradient of a linear demand curve remains unchanged over time, while the elasticity of a curve is sensitive to changes in price. Elasticity may be thought of as the ratio of percentage change in quantity requested to percentage change in price. Even if the slope of a linear demand curve remains the same, the curve's elasticity will vary depending on the price at which it is measured. This is due to the fact that the percentage change in quantity required will not be the same at all prices.
