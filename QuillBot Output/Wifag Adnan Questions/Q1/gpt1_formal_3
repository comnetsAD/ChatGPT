False. The slope of a linear demand curve is constant, however the elasticity of a curve fluctuates with price, since it is the ratio of the percentage change in quantity requested to the percentage change in price. The elasticity of a linear demand curve will vary at various prices since the percentage change in amount required will not be the same at all prices, despite the constant slope.
