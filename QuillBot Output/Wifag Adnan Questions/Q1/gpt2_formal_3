False. A linear demand curve may have a constant slope, but its price elasticity is not always constant. Elasticity of demand is the ratio of the percentage change in quantity requested to the percentage change in price, and it may vary depending on the price level. Consequently, the elasticity of a linear demand curve will change with the price level.
