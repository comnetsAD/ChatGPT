False. A linear demand curve has a constant slope, but its elasticity changes as a function of the price level. Elasticity is defined as the ratio of the percentage change in quantity requested to the percentage change in price. Since the percentage change in quantity sought is not the same across all prices, even while the slope is constant, a linear demand curve will have varying elasticity at various prices.
