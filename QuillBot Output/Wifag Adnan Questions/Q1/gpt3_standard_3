will result in a decline in market pricing and a loss of profit for both businesses. GTP2 q P q E P TR P TR E TC P TC E Profit P Profit E 2 2 6 12 12 4 8 8\s2 2.5 5.5 11 13.75 4 7 9.75\s2.5 2 5.5 13.75 11 4.5 4 9.25 8\s2.5 2.5 5 12.5 12.5 5 5 7.5 7.5 Each row in this matrix illustrates a distinct situation in which one company decides to create 2 million bottles while the other decides to make 2.5 million bottles. Both businesses decide to make 2 million bottles for the first row. The total amount provided (Q), which is the product of q P and q E, determines the market price (P). Accordingly, P = 10 - Q = 10 - (2 + 2) = 6 is the result. This pricing will result in TR P = P * q P = 6 * 2 = 12 and TR E = P * q E = 6 * 2 = 12 as the total revenue for each business. TC P = 2 * q P + 1 = 2 * 2 + 1 = 5 and TC E = 2 * q E + 1 = 2 * 2 + 1 = 5 are the total costs for each business. As a result, Profit P = TR P - TC P = 12 - 5 = 7 and Profit E = TR E - TC E = 12 - 5 = 7 represent the profits for each business. By substituting the q P and q E values for each scenario and using the method for P, TR, TC, and Profit, you can similarly compute the remaining rows. However, the price of water is influenced by the total amount given by both enterprises, even though each company in this situation confronts the identical payoffs independent of the decision made by the other firm. Yes, the scenario described above is represented by the following payout matrix: Profit P Profit E q P q E q P q E P TR P TR E TC P TC E 2 2 6 12 12 6 6 6 6\s2 2.5 5 10 12.5 6 7.5 4 5\s2.5 2 5 12.5 10 7.5 6 5 4\s2.5 2.5 4 12.5 12.5 7.5 8.5 5 4 Each company in this table has the option of producing either 2 million or 2.5 million water bottles. The market price (P) is derived from the inverse demand function (P = 10 - Q) and the product of the output of both businesses (Q = q P + q E). The amount produced is multiplied by the market price to get the Total Revenue (TR) for each business (P * q). The cost function (TC = 2q + 1) is used to determine the Total Cost (TC) for each company. Each company's profit is determined by deducting its total costs from its total revenues (profit = TR - TC). This reward matrix shows that the businesses make the most money when they both manufacture 2 million water bottles. A company will outperform another if it produces more.
