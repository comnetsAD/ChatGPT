False. Although a linear demand curve could have a slope that is always the same, this does not mean that it has the same elasticity no matter what the price is. The elasticity of demand is calculated by dividing the percentage change in quantity requested by the percentage change in price; this ratio is subject to change based on the current level of prices. As a result, the level of prices will have an effect on the degree to which an otherwise linear demand curve's elasticity varies.
