False. Although the slope of a linear demand curve remains constant, this does not guarantee that it is also price insensitive. In economics, price elasticity of demand is defined as the ratio of the percentage change in the quantity requested to the percentage change in the price. When a result, a linear demand curve's elasticity will change as prices shift.
