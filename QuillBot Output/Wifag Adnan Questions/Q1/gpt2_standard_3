False. Even while a linear demand curve's slope may remain constant, its elasticity may not always be the same. Elasticity of demand, which varies based on price level, is calculated as the percentage change in quantity requested divided by the percentage change in price. Therefore, depending on the price level, a linear demand curve's elasticity will likewise change.
