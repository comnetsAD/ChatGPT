False. A linear demand curve has a constant slope, but its elasticity fluctuates with price since it is the ratio of percentage change in quantity requested to percentage change in price. Even though the slope is constant, a linear demand curve will have varying elasticity at various prices since the percentage change in amount sought will not be the same at all prices.
