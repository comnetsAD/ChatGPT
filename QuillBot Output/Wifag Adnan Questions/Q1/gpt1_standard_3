False. The ratio of the percentage change in quantity requested to the percentage change in price determines a curve's elasticity, which changes based on price. A linear demand curve has a constant slope. Even if the slope of a linear demand curve remains constant, its elasticity will vary depending on the price since the percentage change in amount requested will alter depending on the price.
