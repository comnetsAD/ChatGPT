False. Although a linear demand curve has a constant slope, it does not always have the same elasticity at all prices. Elasticity of demand is defined as the percentage change in quantity requested divided by the percentage change in price, and it varies with price level. As a result, the elasticity of a linear demand curve varies with price level.
