Short-term economic profits are possible in monopolistically competitive markets, but not long-term. In the long term, new enterprises are attracted by current firms' large profits, increasing the supply of hairdressing services and lowering the market price. Thus, existing enterprises' earnings go to zero. Thus, monopolistic competition makes it improbable that your hairdresser can continue generating a profit and retire in five years. Instead, the hairdressing sector would be very competitive. In a totally competitive market, companies absorb prices and cannot affect them. Industry supply and demand influence market pricing. Since the market price will eventually equal the average total cost, enterprises cannot generate an economic profit. Your hairdresser would struggle to make a profit and retire in five years due to market competition.
