By asking students to present their student ID and charging them a cheaper charge, the movie theater may price discriminate between students and academics. The movie theater should charge the maximum price that students are willing to pay, which is $5, and the highest price that professors are willing to pay, which is $10, in order to maximize its profit. Due to the fact that each individual will only purchase one ticket, the theater will offer all 900 student tickets for $5 and all 100 professor tickets for $10. The profit of the movie theater may be estimated by multiplying the number of tickets sold by the difference between the price and the marginal cost and then summing across both client groups. (900*($5-$3)) + (100*($10-$3)) = $2400 The consumer surplus is the gap between what a consumer is prepared to pay and what they actually pay. Consumer surplus = 900*($5-$5) = $0 for students Consumer surplus = 100*($10-$10) Equals $0 for academics. In this situation, all 900 students and 100 professors will purchase the tickets since they are all willing to pay the costs that are being charged. A total of 1000 tickets will be offered, with 900 selling for $5 and 100 selling for $10. The movie theater will generate a $2400 profit, with no consumer surplus.
