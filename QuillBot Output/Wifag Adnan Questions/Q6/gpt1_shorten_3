The movie theater charges students $5 and professors $10 each ticket because it may price discriminate. Thus, the theater captures both parties' willingness to spend. The theater will offer 900 $5 student tickets. The theater will sell 100 $10 seats to academics since they're willing to pay. Marginal cost minus revenue yields the movie theater's profit. The movie theater will sell 900 $5 tickets and 100 $10 tickets, making $3500 in profit. Consumer surplus is the gap between a consumer's maximal price and their actual price. (900)($5 - $5) = $0 for students, and (100)($10 - $10) = $0 for professors. Thus, the movie theater will sell 900 student tickets at $5 each and 100 professor seats at $10 each, making $3500 and generating $0.
