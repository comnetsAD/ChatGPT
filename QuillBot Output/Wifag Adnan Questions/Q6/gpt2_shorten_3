Student IDs allow the movie theater to charge students less. The movie theater should charge students $5 and professors $10 to maximize profits. Since each individual will buy one ticket, the theater will sell all 900 student tickets at $5 and all 100 professor tickets at $10. The movie theater's profit may be estimated by multiplying the number of tickets sold by the price-marginal cost differential and summing across both categories of consumers. (900*($5-$3)) + (100*($10-$3)) = $2400 Consumer surplus is the gap between a consumer's maximal willing payment and their actual payment. Student consumer surplus = 900*($5-$5) = $0 Professor consumer surplus = 100*($10-$10) = $0. Since they're willing to pay, all 900 students and 100 teachers will purchase tickets. 1000 tickets—900 at $5 and 100 at $10—will be offered. Consumer surplus will be $0 and the movie theater will earn $2400.
