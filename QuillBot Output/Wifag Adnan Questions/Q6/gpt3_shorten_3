Depending on their willingness to pay, the movie theater may charge students and professors varying amounts for movie tickets. The cinema may charge students $5 for a movie ticket and professors $10 for a movie ticket. All 900 kids will purchase a movie ticket at $5 since the price is at or below their willingness to pay. At $10, just 100 academics will purchase a movie ticket since the price is equivalent to or less than what they are willing to spend. The movie theater will sell a total of 1000 tickets, consisting of 900 tickets to students and 100 seats to teachers. The profit of the movie theater may be determined by deducting the marginal cost of $3 per ticket from the total revenue of $5 per student ticket and $10 each professor ticket. The profit will be $4,500 ($5 x 900) plus ($10 x 100) minus ($3 x 1000) Subtracting the price paid by the customer from their willingness to pay yields the consumer surplus. Students will have a consumer surplus of ($5 x 900) − ($5 x 900) = $0. Professors will have a consumer surplus of ($10 x 100) − ($10 x 100) = $0. The movie theater is maximizing its profit via price discrimination by charging varying prices for the same product. The theater is completely sold out since the costs are at or below the willingness to pay of both students and faculty. However, neither students nor professors experience a consumer surplus since they pay their willingness to pay.
