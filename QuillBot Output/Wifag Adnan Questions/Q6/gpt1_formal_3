Since the movie theater may charge students and professors different prices, it will charge students $5 per ticket and professors $10 per ticket. This allows the theater to collect both groups' complete readiness to pay. The students' willingness to pay is $5, thus the theater will provide 900 student tickets at $5 apiece. The academics' readiness to pay is $10, thus the theater will sell 100 seats at $10 apiece to professors. The profit of the movie theater may be determined by deducting the marginal cost from the revenue. The marginal cost per ticket is $3, and the theater will sell 900 tickets at $5 each and 100 tickets at $10 each, resulting in a profit of (900)($5 - $3) + (100)($10 - $3) = $3,500. Customer surplus is the gap between the highest amount a consumer would be prepared to pay for an item and the price they actually pay. The consumer surplus for the students is (900)($5 - $5) = $0, while the consumer surplus for the professors is (100)($10 - $10) = $0. Therefore, the movie theater will sell 900 student tickets at $5 each, 100 professor tickets at $10 each, earn $3,500, and the consumer surplus for both groups will be $0.
