Because the movie theater has the ability to price discriminate between students and professors, it will charge students $5 per ticket and professors $10 per ticket. The theater may so catch the whole willingness to pay of both groups. Because the students' willingness to pay is $5, the theater will sell 900 tickets at $5 apiece. Because the professors' willingness to pay is $10, the theater will sell 100 seats at $10 apiece. The profit of a movie theater may be estimated by deducting the marginal cost from the revenue. The marginal cost per ticket is $3, and the movie theater will sell 900 $5 tickets and 100 $10 tickets, for a profit of (900)($5 - $3) + (100)($10 - $3) = $3500. The difference between the highest amount a customer is prepared to pay for an item and the actual price they pay is known as consumer surplus. The consumer surplus for students is (900)($5 - $5) = $0, whereas the consumer surplus for professors is (100)($10 - $10) = $0. As a result, the movie theater will sell 900 $5 tickets to students and 100 $10 tickets to professors, making a profit of $3500 and a consumer surplus of $0.
