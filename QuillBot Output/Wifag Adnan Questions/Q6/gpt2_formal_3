By asking students to provide their student ID and charging them a lesser charge, the movie theater may engage in price discrimination between students and faculty members. To optimize its profit, the movie theater should charge the highest prices that students and professors are willing to pay, which are $5 and $10, respectively. Due to the fact that each individual will only purchase one ticket, the theater will offer all 900 student tickets for $5 and all 100 professor seats for $10. The profit of the movie theater may be determined by multiplying the number of tickets sold by the difference between the price and marginal cost, and then summing across both consumer groups. (900*($5-$3)) + (100*($10-$3)) = $2400 The consumer surplus is the gap between the highest price a consumer would be prepared to pay and the actual amount they pay. For students, Consumer surplus = 900*($5-$5) = $0 Consumer surplus = 100*($10-$10) Equals $0 for academics. In this instance, all 900 students and 100 professors will purchase tickets since they are willing to pay the fees. There will be a total of 1000 tickets sold, consisting of 900 $5 tickets and 100 $10 tickets. The movie theater will earn $2400 in profit, yet there will be no consumer excess.
