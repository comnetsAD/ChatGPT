By asking students to present their student ID and charging them a lesser charge, the theater may practice price discrimination between students and professors. The theater may make the most money by charging the higher of the two prices: the $5 that students are willing to pay or the $10 that academics are ready to pay. Due to the fact that patrons will only purchase a single ticket, the theater will be able to offer all 900 student tickets for $5 and all 100 professor seats at $10. The profit of the movie theater may be computed by multiplying the number of consumers by the difference between the price and the marginal cost, and then summing across all customers. (900*($5-$3)) + (100*($10-$3)) = $2400 Consumer surplus refers to the amount by which actual purchases exceed consumers' willingness to pay maximum prices. As a simple example, consider the following student consumer surplus formula: 900 * (five dollars minus five dollars) = zero. Academics' consumer surplus may be calculated as 100 times ($10-$10), which is zero. All 900 pupils and 100 teachers will pay the full amount for tickets since they are all enthusiastic attendees. With the $5 price point covering 900 tickets and the $10 price point covering the remaining 100, the total number of tickets sold will be 1000. The theater will earn $2,400, but consumers will have no excess.
