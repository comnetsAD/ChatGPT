The movie theater has the ability to price discriminate between students and professors, and as a result, it will charge students $5 for each ticket while charging professors $10 for each ticket. By doing business in this manner, the theater is able to assess the total desire to pay shown by both groups. Since the most that the students are ready to pay is $5, the theater has decided to offer 900 tickets to the students at the price of $5 each. Because the professors' highest price point of acceptance is ten dollars, the theater has decided to offer one hundred seats to the professors at the price of ten dollars apiece. The profit made by the movie theater may be determined by taking the revenue and deducting the marginal cost from that number. The marginal cost of each ticket is $3, and the movie theater expects to sell 900 tickets at $5 each and 100 tickets at $10 each, so the profit will be (900)($5-$3) + (100)($10-$3) = $3,500. Because the marginal cost of each ticket is $3, the movie theater expects to sell 900 tickets at $5 each and 100 tickets at $10 each. The term "consumer surplus" refers to the gap between the most money a customer is willing to spend on an item and the amount of money the consumer actually spends for that good. The consumer surplus for the students is calculated as (900)($5 - $5), which equals $0. The consumer surplus for the professors is calculated as (100)($10 - $10), which equals $0. As a result, the movie theater will generate a profit of $3,500, sell 900 tickets to students at $5 each, 100 tickets to professors at $10 each, and sell 900 tickets to students at $10 each. The consumer surplus for both groups will be $0.
