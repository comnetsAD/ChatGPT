The movie theater has the right to charge different prices to students and professors, and one way it does this is by asking students to produce their student ID in order to get a discount. The movie theater should charge the highest price that students are willing to pay, which is $5, and the highest price that professors are willing to pay, which is $10, in order to make the most profit possible. Students should pay $5, and professors should pay $10. Due to the fact that each individual will only purchase one ticket, the theater will offer all 900 student tickets for $5 while selling all 100 professor seats for $10. The amount of money that the movie theater made in profit may be determined by multiplying the number of tickets sold by the disparity between the pricing and the marginal cost, and then adding up the totals for both sets of consumers. (900*($5-$3)) + (100*($10-$3)) = $2400 The consumer surplus may be defined as the gap between the most a customer is prepared to pay and the amount that they actually shell out for a product or service. For students, Consumer surplus = 900*($5-$5) = $0 Consumer surplus is one hundred times the difference between ten dollars and ten dollars for academics, which equals zero dollars. Since of this, all 900 students and 100 professors will purchase tickets for the event because they are ready to pay the rates that are being asked for them. There will be a total of 1000 tickets sold, with 900 tickets being sold at the $5 price point and 100 tickets being sold at the $10 price point. A profit of $2,400 will be realized by the movie theater, but there will be no consumer surplus.
