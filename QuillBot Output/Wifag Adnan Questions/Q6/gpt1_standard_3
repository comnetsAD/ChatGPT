The movie theater will charge students $5 per ticket and professors $10 per ticket since it is legal to set different prices for them. The theater is able to fully represent both groups' willingness to pay in this manner. The theater will offer 900 student tickets at a price of $5 apiece since the students' maximum willingness to pay is $5. The theater will sell 100 seats to academics at a price of $10 apiece since that is the amount they are willing to spend. The margin cost must be subtracted from the revenue to determine the theater's profit. The movie theater will sell 900 tickets at $5 each and 100 at $10 each, for a profit of (900)($5 - $3) + (100)($10 - $3) = $3500. The marginal cost per ticket is $3. The difference between the utmost price a customer is prepared to pay and the final price they pay is known as the consumer surplus. The consumer surplus for the students is (900)($5 - $5) = $0, while the consumer surplus for the professors is (100)($10 - $10) = $0. The movie theater will therefore generate a profit of $3500 by selling 900 tickets to students at $5 each and 100 tickets to professors at $10 each, with no consumer surplus for either group.
