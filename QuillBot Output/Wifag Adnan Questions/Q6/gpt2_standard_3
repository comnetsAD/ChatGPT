By forcing students to provide their student ID and charging them a cheaper ticket, the movie theater may charge professors a higher amount. The movie theater should charge the maximum amount that professors and students are willing to pay, which is $10, in order to make the most money possible. The theater will sell all 900 student tickets for $5 and all 100 professor seats for $10 as each individual will only purchase one ticket. The difference between the price and the marginal cost multiplied by the quantity of tickets sold, together with the total of both client groups, may be used to compute the movie theater's profit. (900*($5-$3)) + (100*($10-$3)) = $2400 The gap between the utmost price a customer would be prepared to pay and the price they actually pay is known as the consumer surplus. Consumer surplus for students equals 900*($5-$5) = $0. Consumer surplus for academics is 100*($10-$10) = $0. Since everyone is ready to pay the rates being asked, all 900 students and 100 professors will purchase tickets in this situation. A total of 1000 tickets will be offered, with 900 being sold for $5 and 100 being sold for $10. The movie theater will earn $2400 in profit, and there will be no customer excess.
