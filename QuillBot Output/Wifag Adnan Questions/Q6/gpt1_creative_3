Given its ability to charge different prices to different patrons, the movie theater has decided to charge students $5 per ticket and professors $10 per ticket. The theater may thereby profit from both parties' full readiness to pay. Because the students' willingness to pay is $5, the theater will offer 900 student tickets at that price. There is a $10 price point that the academics are willing to pay, therefore the theater will sell 100 seats to the professors at that price. Subtracting the marginal cost from the revenue yields the profit for the cinema. The movie theater has a $3 marginal cost per ticket, and if it sells 900 tickets at $5 each and 100 tickets at $10 each, it will earn $3,500. Customer surplus refers to the amount of money left over after a consumer has paid the market price for an item or service. The consumer surplus is $0 for both the pupils and the teachers since (900)($5 - $5) = $0 and (100)($10 - $10) = $0, respectively. The theater may generate $3,500 by selling 900 student tickets at $5 each and 100 professor seats at $10 apiece. The consumer surplus for both groups is $0.
