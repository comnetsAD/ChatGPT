Here's a payout matrix for the case above: TR P TR E TC P TC E Profit P Profit E 2 2 6 12 12 6 6 6 6\s2 2.5 5 10 12.5 6 7.5 4 5\s2.5 2 5 12.5 10 7.5 6 5 4\s2.5 2.5 4 12.5 12.5 7.5 8.5 5 4 This table lets firms make 2 million or 2.5 million water bottles. Q = q P + q E and P = 10 â€“ Q establish the market price (P). Each firm's Total Revenue (TR) is computed by multiplying its production by the market price (P * q). The cost function (2q + 1) calculates each firm's Total Cost (TC). Profit = TR - TC for each enterprise. This reward matrix shows that both enterprises earn most when they create 2 million water bottles. One business producing more than the other will lower market price and profit for both enterprises.
