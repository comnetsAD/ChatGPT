In this game, the Nash Equilibrium is the set of strategies where neither business can maximize its payout by altering its strategy while the other firm's approach stays unchanged. If both companies want to manufacture 2 million bottles of water, then the Nash Equilibrium is (q P = 2, q E = 2). In this equilibrium situation, neither company can boost its profit by modifying its plan while the other company's approach stays unchanged. For instance, if Perrier increased output to 2.5 million bottles, its profit would reduce from 7 to 6.25, but Evian's profit would stay the same. If Evian were to boost output to 2.5 million bottles, the company's earnings would drop from $7 to $6.25 per bottle while Perrier's would stay the same. The cooperative solution (q P = 2.5, q E = 2.5) is not reachable if the businesses only engage once. Each company would create 2.5 million water bottles in the cooperative scenario, yielding a combined profit of $7.5 million. The only way for the cooperative solution to be achieved is for all enterprises to commit to the plan at the same time, which they cannot do because of the lack of coordination. Since the companies are rational, they will choose for the approach that maximizes their profits; in this instance, the Nash Equilibrium is (q P = 2, q E = 2), which is not the cooperative option. GTP2 The game's Nash Equilibrium occurs when neither company benefits from altering its strategy based on the other's. Since neither company would benefit from producing more than two million bottles of water, the Nash Equilibrium occurs when both companies make that many. Because if one company makes 2.5 million bottles and the other makes 2 million bottles, the first company's earnings will go down while the second company's would go up. Nash equilibrium profits for each company are $6,000,000. (total revenue of 12 million minus total cost of 6 million). In this scenario, the cooperative solution is impossible if companies only communicate once. This is so because long-term collaboration between the companies is unrealistic. That is to say, if the companies only deal with one another once, there is no guarantee that the other company will continue to abide by the terms of the collaboration agreement in the future. Therefore, in order to maximize their profits, both companies will have an incentive to break the agreement by producing the full 2.5 million bottles of water.
