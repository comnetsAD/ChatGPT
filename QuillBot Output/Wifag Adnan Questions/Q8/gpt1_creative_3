Certainly, here is a payout matrix that captures the essence of the predicament stated above: P q P P q E P TR q P TR q E TC q P TC q E Profit q P Profit q E 2 2 6 12 12 6 6 6 6\s2 2.5 5 10 12.5 6 7.5 4 5\s2.5 2 5 12.5 10 7.5 6 5 4\s2.5 2.5 4 12.5 12.5 7.5 8.5 5 4 All companies in this table have the option of making either 2 million or 2.5 million water bottles. Price (P) is equal to the inverse of the demand function (P = 10 - Q), which is calculated as the total of the output from both businesses (Q = q P + q E). Each company's Total Revenue (TR) is found by multiplying its output by its selling price in the market (TR = P * q). Using the cost function provided (TC = 2q + 1), we can get the Total Cost (TC) for each company. Each company's profit may be determined by taking their total revenue and subtracting their total expenses (Profit = TR - TC). The reward matrix shows that producing 2 million bottles of water simultaneously is the sweet spot for both companies. The market price and the businesses' profits will both decline if one produces more than the other.
