This game's Nash Equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each business, where neither firm can increase its payout by altering its strategy while the other firm's stays unchanged. Since both enterprises would create 2 million water bottles, the Nash Equilibrium is (q P = 2, q E = 2). At this equilibrium, neither company can benefit by changing its strategy while the other's stays constant. Perrier's profit would drop from 7 to 6.25 if it produced 2.5 million bottles, whereas Evian's would stay the same. Evian's profit would drop from 7 to 6.25 if it produced 2.5 million bottles, but Perrier's would stay same. The cooperative solution (q P = 2.5, q E = 2.5) is impossible if companies only interact once. In the cooperative arrangement, both enterprises would create 2.5 million water bottles, maximizing their shared profit at 7.5 million. Since enterprises can't coordinate activity, they can't accomplish the cooperative solution until they commit to the plan, which they can't. The Nash Equilibrium (q P = 2, q E = 2) differs from the cooperative solution because companies are rational and adopt the strategy that maximizes their profit.
