Sure, here's a payout matrix that depicts the above-mentioned situation: q P q E P TR P TR E TC P TC E Profit P Profit E TC P TC E 2 2 6 12 12 6 6 6 6\s2 2.5 5 10 12.5 6 7.5 4 5\s2.5 2 5 12.5 10 7.5 6 5 4\s2.5 2.5 4 12.5 12.5 7.5 8.5 5 4 Each company in this chart has the option of producing 2 million or 2.5 million bottles of water. The market price (P) is determined by the product of both businesses' production (Q = q P + q E) and the inverse demand function (P = 10 - Q). Total Revenue (TR) is computed for each business by multiplying the quantity produced by the market price (TR = P * q). Each firm's Total Cost (TC) is determined using the supplied cost function (TC = 2q + 1). Profit is computed for each organization by subtracting Total Cost from Total Revenue (Profit = TR - TC). According to this reward matrix, the enterprises make the most money when they create 2 million bottles of water. If one business produces more than the other, the market price falls and the profit for both companies falls.
