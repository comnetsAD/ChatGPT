Certainly, here is a payout matrix representing the circumstance discussed before. Profit P Profit E q P q E P TR P TR E TC P TC E 2 2 6 12 12 6 6 6 6\s2 2.5 5 10 12.5 6 7.5 4 5\s2.5 2 5 12.5 10 7.5 6 5 4\s2.5 2.5 4 12.5 12.5 7.5 8.5 5 4 In this table, each company has the option of producing 2 million or 2.5 million water bottles. The market price (P) is determined by the total of both businesses' production (Q = q P + q E) and the inverse demand function (P = 10 - Q). Total Revenue (TR) is computed by multiplying the amount generated by the market price (P * q) for each company. Total Cost (TC) is computed for each company using the specified cost function (TC = 2q + q). Profit is determined by subtracting Total Cost from Total Revenue (Profit = TR - TC). According to this payoff matrix, the most profit is realized when both companies create 2 million water bottles. If one business produces more than the other, the market price will fall and both companies' profits would decline.
