In this game, the Nash Equilibrium is the set of strategies where neither business can increase its payout relative to the other by altering its strategy while the other firm's strategy is held constant. Because both companies would want to manufacture 2 million bottles of water, the Nash Equilibrium is (q P = 2, q E = 2). With the two strategies at equilibrium, neither company can improve its profitability by switching to a different one while the other keeps its current one. For instance, if Perrier doubled its output to 7.5 million bottles, its profit would drop to 6.25 million dollars, but Evian's would stay the same. Similarily, if Evian increased output to 2.5 million bottles, its profit would reduce from 7 to 6.25, but Perrier's profit would stay same. The cooperative solution (q P = 2.5, q E = 2.5) is not attainable if the businesses only engage once. Working together, the two businesses can create 2.5 million water bottles and increase their combined profit to $7.5 million. Nonetheless, corporations can't reach the cooperative solution since they can't commit to the plan as a whole, which they obviously can't do because they can't coordinate the activity. Due to the businesses' innate self-interest, the Nash Equilibrium in this scenario is (q P = 2, q E = 2), which is not the same as the cooperative solution. GTP2 In the Nash Equilibrium, both firms are content with their current strategies and have no need to alter them based on the other's moves. Since neither company would benefit from producing more than 2 million bottles of water, the Nash Equilibrium occurs when both companies make that many. This is due to the fact that if one company produces 2.5 million bottles and the other produces 2 million bottles, the former will experience a drop in profits while the latter would see a gain. Upon reaching the Nash Equilibrium, each company's profits are equal to $6,000,000. (total revenue of 12 million minus total cost of 6 million). If the companies just communicate once, they will not be able to reach the joint solution. This is so due to the fact that the companies cannot maintain their partnership for an extended length of time. This means that a single interaction between the companies is not sufficient to guarantee that both companies would continue to abide by the terms of their collaboration agreement in the future. That's why it's in everyone's best interest if both companies create 2.5 million bottles of water, instead of just one.
