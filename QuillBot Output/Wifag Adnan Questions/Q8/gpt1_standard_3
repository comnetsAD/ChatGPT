Yes, the scenario described above is represented by the following payout matrix: Profit P Profit E q P q E q P q E P TR P TR E TC P TC E 2 2 6 12 12 6 6 6 6\s2 2.5 5 10 12.5 6 7.5 4 5\s2.5 2 5 12.5 10 7.5 6 5 4\s2.5 2.5 4 12.5 12.5 7.5 8.5 5 4 Each company in this table has the option of producing either 2 million or 2.5 million water bottles. The market price (P) is derived from the inverse demand function (P = 10 - Q) and the product of the output of both businesses (Q = q P + q E). The amount produced is multiplied by the market price to get the Total Revenue (TR) for each business (P * q). The cost function (TC = 2q + 1) is used to determine the Total Cost (TC) for each company. Each company's profit is determined by deducting its total costs from its total revenues (profit = TR - TC). This reward matrix shows that the businesses make the most money when they both manufacture 2 million water bottles. If one company produces more than the other, the market price will drop and both companies' profits would decline as a result.
