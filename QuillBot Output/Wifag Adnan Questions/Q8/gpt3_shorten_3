In this game, the Nash Equilibrium is the set of strategies where neither business can increase its payout relative to the other by altering its strategy while the other firm's approach stays unchanged. Given that both companies would want to manufacture 2 million bottles of water, the Nash Equilibrium is (q P = 2, q E = 2). Because both firms are at a point of equilibrium, none can improve its profitability by shifting gears while the other keeps to its current course. If Perrier were to expand output to 2.5 million bottles, for instance, its profit would reduce from 7 to 6.25 while Evian's profit would stay same. Similarly, if Evian increased output to 2.5 million bottles, its profit would decline from 7 to 6.25, but Perrier's profit would stay same. The cooperative solution (q P = 2.5, q E = 2.5) is impossible to obtain with a single interaction between the enterprises. To optimize their combined profit of $7.5 million, the companies should work together to create 2.5 million bottles of water. Firms can't reach the cooperative solution since they can't agree on a unified plan, which is impossible given their inability to coordinate their actions. A Nash Equilibrium (q P = 2, q E = 2) is reached, which is not the cooperative solution since the businesses are rational and would adopt the strategy that maximizes their personal profit. GTP2 This game's Nash Equilibrium occurs when neither company benefits from altering its strategy in light of the other's. Considering that neither company would benefit from producing more than 2 million bottles of water, the Nash Equilibrium occurs when both companies make that many. This is due to the fact that a fall in profits for the business producing 2.5 million bottles will result in an increase in profits for the firm producing 2 million bottles. Every company makes $6,000,000 at the Nash Equilibrium (total revenue of 12 million minus total cost of 6 million). It is clear that a single interaction between the enterprises will not be enough to get the cooperative solution. This is because long-term collaboration between the businesses is unrealistic. Thus, a single meeting is not enough to ensure that both companies would continue to abide by the terms of their collaboration agreement in the future. In order to maximize their profits, both companies will have an incentive to break the agreement and create more than the agreed-upon 2.5 million bottles of water.
