Okay, in that case, I'll give you with a reward matrix that illustrates the circumstance that was mentioned earlier: q P q E P TR P TR E TC P TC E Profit P Profit E q P q E P q P q E P 2 2 6 12 12 6 6 6 6\s2 2.5 5 10 12.5 6 7.5 4 5\s2.5 2 5 12.5 10 7.5 6 5 4\s2.5 2.5 4 12.5 12.5 7.5 8.5 5 4 In the following table, each company has the option of producing either 2 million or 2.5 million bottled water containers. The market price, denoted by the letter P, is established by summing the output of both companies, denoted by the equation Q = q P + q E, and applying the inverse demand function, denoted by the equation P = 10 - Q. To get a company's total revenue, or TR, just multiply the amount of product that was manufactured by the going rate in the industry (TR = P * q). The Total Cost (TC) for each company is determined by using the cost function that has been provided, which is (TC = 2q + 1). The formula for determining a company's profit is as follows: Profit = Total Revenue - Total Cost (Profit equals Total Revenue minus Total Cost). According to the data shown in this payoff matrix, the two companies will make the most money if they create 2 million bottles of water simultaneously. If one company produces more than the other, it will drive down the price of the good on the market, which will result in a reduction in profit for both companies.
