There exists a set of strategies, one for each business, known as the Nash Equilibrium of this game, where neither firm can maximize its payout by altering its strategy while the other firm's approach is held constant. As both companies would want to manufacture 2 million bottles of water, the Nash Equilibrium is (q P = 2, q E = 2). In this equilibrium situation, neither company can boost its profit by altering its strategy while the other company maintains its current one. If Perrier doubled its output to 2.5 million bottles, its profit would drop from $7 to $6.25 but Evian's would stay the same. Also, if Evian doubled its output to 2.5 million bottles, its profit would drop from $7 to $6.25, but Perrier's would stay the same at $7. Achieving the cooperative solution (q P = 2.5, q E = 2.5) requires more than a single interaction between the enterprises. Together, the enterprises may create 2.5 million bottles of water, generating a maximum profit of $7.5 million. Achieving the cooperative solution, however, requires unwavering commitment to the approach, which is impossible given the absence of action coordination. To put it another way, the Nash Equilibrium is (q P = 2, q E = 2), which is not the same as the cooperative solution, since the businesses are rational and would select the strategy that maximizes their own profit. GTP2 The Nash Equilibrium of this game occurs when neither business can gain by changing its strategy in light of the other firm's plan. Due to a lack of motivation for either company to create more than 2 million bottles of water, the Nash Equilibrium is reached when both companies produce 2 million bottles. Because if one company makes 2.5 million bottles and the other produces 2 million bottles, the first company's earnings will go down and the second company's will go up. Each firm's profit is $6,000,000 in the Nash Equilibrium (total revenue of 12 million minus total cost of 6 million). The businesses can't get to the cooperative solution if they simply talk to each other once. That's because it's unrealistic to expect the companies to keep working together for very long. In other words, if the companies only deal with one another once, there is no way to ensure that the other company would continue to abide by the terms of the collaboration agreement. Because of this, there is a strong financial incentive for both companies to violate the terms of the agreement and manufacture the full quota of 2.5 million bottles of water.
