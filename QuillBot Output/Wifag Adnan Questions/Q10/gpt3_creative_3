Businesses may make short-term economic gains in a monopolistically competitive market, but these profits will evaporate over time. Since new businesses may join the market and be lured by the high profits of established businesses, the supply of hairdressing services increases, and the market price falls, in the long term. This causes established businesses to have a decline in profitability that finally leads to a loss. Therefore, if the market structure is monopolistic competition, it is improbable that your hairdresser will be able to continue generating a profit and retiring in five years. The scenario would be different if the hairstyling business was fiercely competitive. Firms in a totally competitive market have no influence on the market price and are thus price takers. How much anything costs in the market is based on how much demand there is and how much supply there is. Since the market price tends to match the average total cost, companies can never earn an economic profit by selling their wares. Strong market rivalry would make it challenging for your hairdresser to achieve a profit over the typical return on investment, making it tough for him or her to retire in five years.
