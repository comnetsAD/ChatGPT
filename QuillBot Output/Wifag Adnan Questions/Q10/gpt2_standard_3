There are numerous companies that sell comparable but distinct goods in a monopolistically competitive market, and entry barriers are minimal. Firms do have some market power under these market circumstances, but it is not as powerful as it would be in a monopoly. This indicates that businesses may make economic gains in the near term but not in the long term. In the short term, businesses may charge more for their distinctive product, but in the long run, new businesses will join the market and those that are already there will face more competition, which will result in lower pricing and lower earnings. As a result, it is doubtful that your hairdresser will make a profit for at least five years. The competition will intensify as more businesses join the market, which will result in a smaller profit margin. In addition, other businesses will begin to mimic your hairdresser's business model and provide comparable services, which will further weaken your hairdresser's position in the market. If the hairdressing market was very competitive, your hairdresser would have to run their business at the lowest possible average total cost and charge what the market would bear, ultimately making no money. The scenario for the hairdresser would be different since the market would be much more price-sensitive. In order to draw in and maintain consumers, the hairdresser would need to concentrate on keeping expenses down and offering top-notch service. In addition to being unable to charge more for differentiated services, the hairdresser would also be unable to retire in five years.
