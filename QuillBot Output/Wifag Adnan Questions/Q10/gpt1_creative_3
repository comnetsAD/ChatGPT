In a monopolistically competitive industry, it is quite improbable that a hairstylist will be able to turn a profit and retire within the next five years. In a monopolistic competitive market, several businesses provide items that are just marginally different from one another, creating intense rivalry between them. The hairdresser may feel compelled to cut costs because of competition from other salons in the area. There is a long-term tendency for enterprises in this market structure to generate just average earnings. Including solely the opportunity cost of the resources put in the company, the typical profit is the bare minimum needed to keep the business afloat. As a result, the hairstylist may not be able to retire in the next five years, even if the company is profitable, since the earnings may only be enough to cover the opportunity cost of the resources spent in the firm. Things may be different if the hairstyling business was fiercely competitive. There is no room for enterprises to set their own prices in a completely competitive market, therefore all the firms there just accept whatever price the market sets. The long-term profitability is low, and they lack a unique selling proposition. A hairstylist in a completely competitive market would have an even tougher time making a profit and being able to retire in five years, since they would have to charge the same prices as their rivals and would have no chance of generating a bigger profit by charging more.
