In a monopolistically competitive market, enterprises may generate short-term economic gains, but not long-term profits. Long-term, new enterprises are lured to the market by the high profits of current firms, resulting in an increase in the supply of hairdressing services and a decline in market pricing. As a consequence, the profitability of current enterprises decline and finally reach zero. If the industry structure involves monopolistic competition, it is improbable that your hairdresser will be able to continue generating a profit and retire in five years. If the hairdressing business were very competitive, the circumstance would be different. In a completely competitive market, companies are price takers and no one company can affect the market price. The market price is established by the junction of supply and demand in the industry. This indicates that enterprises cannot generate a profit over the long term, since the market price tends to match the average overall cost. In such a situation, it would be impossible for your hairdresser to make a profit and retire in five years, since the market's intense rivalry would make it tough to achieve a return on investment beyond the usual.
