Businesses are able to make economic profits in the short term but not in the long run in a monopolistically competitive market. The long-term strong earnings of current businesses draw new businesses into the market, which leads to a rise in the supply of hairdressing services and a fall in the market price. As a consequence, the earnings of the current businesses decline until they reach zero. Therefore, if the market structure involves monopolistic competition, it is improbable that your hairdresser will be able to continue generating a profit and retire in five years. The scenario would be different if there was fierce competition in the hairdressing sector. Firms are price takers in a market with perfect competition, and no one business has the power to change the market price. The meeting point of industry supply and demand determines the market price. Because the market price tends to match the average total cost over time, businesses cannot sustain an economic profit. In this case, it would be challenging for your hairdresser to turn a profit and retire in five years because of the fierce market rivalry, which would make it challenging to generate any profit over the typical return on investment.
