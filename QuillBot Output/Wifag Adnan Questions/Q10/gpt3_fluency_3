Firms may achieve economic gains in the short term but not in the long run in a monopolistically competitive market. The reason for this is that, in the long term, new enterprises might join the market, drawn by the high profits of current firms, resulting in an increase in supply of hairdressing services and a fall in market price. As a consequence, existing enterprises' earnings fall and finally reach zero. As a result, if the industry structure involves monopolistic competition, it is improbable that your hairdresser will be able to continue generating a profit and retire in five years. The scenario would be different if the hairdressing business was fiercely competitive. Firms are price takers in a completely competitive market, and no one business has the capacity to affect the market price. The confluence between industry supply and demand determines market pricing. This indicates that in the long term, enterprises will be unable to generate an economic profit since the market price will tend to match the average overall cost. In such a case, it would be impossible for your hairdresser to make a profit and retire in five years since the market's high rivalry would make earning any profit over the typical return on investment difficult.
