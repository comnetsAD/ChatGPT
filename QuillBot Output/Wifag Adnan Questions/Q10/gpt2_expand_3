When there are little or no obstacles to entry and multiple companies offering mostly identical but somewhat different items, we say that the market is monopolistically competitive. Companies in such an environment enjoy market dominance, however it is not as great as it would be under a monopoly. This implies that in the short term companies may make money, but in the long run they will become bankrupt. It's true that in the short term, companies may make more money by charging more for their unique product, but in the long run, the market will get saturated with similar products and prices will fall as more firms join the market. Therefore, the likelihood of your hairdresser's business surviving for at least five years is low. Competition will intensify and profit margins will shrink as more companies join the industry. Your hairdresser will lose market share because of competition from new companies that will provide identical services at lower prices. You wouldn't be able to afford to tip your hairdresser since she'd be forced to charge the going rate in a highly competitive market. However, the hairstylist would be in a different position, since the price-sensitive nature of the market would need a greater emphasis on cheap prices and high quality of service in order to attract and maintain consumers. There would be no room for the stylist to increase costs for specialized work, and no way for him to retire in five years.
