In a monopolistically competitive market, several businesses provide comparable but differentiated items with low entry barriers. Firms have market power, but not as much as in a monopoly. Firms may make short-term economic profits but not long-term ones. In the short term, enterprises may charge a higher price for their distinctive product, but other firms will join the market and increase competition, driving down prices and profits. Thus, your hairdresser's profit won't last five years. New enterprises will raise competition and lower profit margins. New companies will mimic your hairdresser's business model and provide identical services, reducing their market strength. If the hairdressing business was very competitive, your hairdresser would have to operate at the minimal average total cost and charge the market price, making no economic profit. The hairdresser would have to concentrate on cheap prices and exceptional service to attract and maintain consumers in a price-sensitive market. The hairdresser could not retire in five years or charge more for differentiated services.
