Short-term economic profits are possible for businesses operating in a market that is monopolistically competitive, but long-term economic earnings are not possible. The reason for this is that in the long run, new businesses are able to enter the market because they are attracted by the high profits that are being made by existing businesses. This results in an increase in the supply of hairdressing services and a decrease in the price that is being charged on the market. As a direct consequence of this, the profitability of the already-established businesses begin to decline and finally reach zero. If the business is characterized by monopolistic rivalry, it is quite improbable that your hairdresser will be able to maintain current levels of profitability and retire within the next five years. If the hairdressing business was instead characterized by intense levels of competition, the current state of affairs would be quite different. Firms are considered to be price takers in a market that is said to be totally competitive since no one business has the power to affect the price of the market. The price that prevails in the market is the result of the confluence of supply and demand in the sector. Because of this, it is impossible for businesses to generate a profit in the long term due to the fact that the price on the market will eventually tend to match the average overall cost. In such a situation, it would be impossible for your hairdresser to make a profit and retire within the next five years. This is because the intense rivalry in the market would make it tough to produce any profit that is in addition to the standard return on the investment.
