There is a low probability that a hairdresser operating in a market that is monopolistically competitive would be able to keep a profit and retire within the next five years. Monopolistic competition is a structure of the market that is defined by several businesses selling items that are just minimally distinguishable from one another. This indicates that there is a substantial degree of rivalry among the enterprises. The hairdresser will be subject to competition from other hairdressers in the market who provide services that are comparable to their own and who could be prepared to cut their pricing in order to attract more consumers. Because of the way this market is structured, businesses have a greater propensity to achieve merely average earnings throughout the course of their whole existence. The normal profit is the minimal amount of profit necessary for a company to remain operational, and it is the only profit that takes into account the opportunity cost of the resources that have been put in the company. Therefore, even if the hairdresser is making a profit, it may not be enough for them to retire in five years, as the profit may just be enough to cover the opportunity cost of the resources that were invested in the business, but it may not be enough to allow the hairdresser to retire. This is because the profit may just be enough to cover the opportunity cost of the resources that were invested in the business. If there was more competition in the hairdressing business, the current state of affairs would be quite different. Firms are price takers and have no influence on the market price in an environment where there is complete and total competition. They are unable to distinguish their product from others on the market, thus they can only expect to generate average earnings in the long term. Because of this, it would be even more difficult for a hairdresser operating in a market that is perfectly competitive to maintain a profit and retire in five years, as they would be required to charge prices that are the same as those of their competitors and would not have the ability to earn a higher profit by charging more.
