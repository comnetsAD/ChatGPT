If you want to decide whether or not you should keep operating the bike store, you should compare the profits you would earn from the bike store to the profits you would earn if you became an accountant and rented out the store. This will help you decide whether or not you should continue to operate the bike store. You make a total profit of $80,000 per year from the bike shop, which is comprised of the following: a revenue of $200,000 per year from the business, with expenditures of $100,000 for the bikes and $20,000 for energy, taxes, and other expenses combined. You would make a total profit of $90,000 per year if you became an accountant and leased out the business. Your pay as an accountant would be $40,000 per year, and the rental income from the store would be $50,000 per year, giving you a total profit of $90,000. Therefore, because becoming an accountant would result in a greater profit of $90,000 per year compared to $80,000 per year from owning the bike business, you should consider renting out the store instead of pursuing a career in accounting.
