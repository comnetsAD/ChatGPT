If running the bike shop is less profitable than becoming an accountant and renting the store to a clothes retail chain, then the choice should be made to run the bike shop rather than becoming an accountant and rent the business to the clothing retail chain. We can determine how profitable the bike shop is by computing its net profit, which is the income subtracted from the expenses of running the business. The annual gross revenue of the bike shop is 200,000 minus 100,000 minus 20,000 for a net profit of 80,000. If you work as an accountant, your annual compensation will be $40,000, and you won't have to worry about covering the costs of running the shop yourself. If you were to rent the store to the clothes retail chain, you would get a rent payment of $50,000 per year. This amount is more than the net profit that the bike shop generated for you. If you want to maximize your income, it would be more beneficial for you to rent the shop to the retail chain since doing so would offer you a revenue of $50,000 per year. Consequently, if you want to maximize your revenue, you should do this. In order to arrive at a wise choice, it is essential to do a thorough analysis of all of the potential outcomes, as well as the associated costs and revenues.
