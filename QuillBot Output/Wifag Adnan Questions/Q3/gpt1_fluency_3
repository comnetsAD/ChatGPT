The relative profitability of the two possibilities influences the decision to continue running the bike shop or to become an accountant and rent the business to the clothes retail chain. To assess the bike shop's profitability, we may compute the net profit, which is the sales less the expenses. The bike shop's net profit is 200,000 - 100,000 - 20,000 = $80,000 each year. If you become an accountant, your annual compensation is $40,000, and you do not have to pay shop charges. Renting the shop to a clothes retail chain would yield you $50,000 per year, which is more than the net profit of the bike business. Since a result, if you want to optimize your earnings, renting the shop to a retail chain would be more beneficial, as it would generate $50,000 per year. To make a solid choice, it's vital to weigh all of the possibilities, expenses, and income.
