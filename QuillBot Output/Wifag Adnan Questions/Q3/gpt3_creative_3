You may decide whether you should keep running the bike shop by weighing the potential earnings from doing so against the potential profits from switching careers to accounting and renting out the space. You make $80,000 a year after paying for rent, utilities, taxes, and inventory at your bike shop, on yearly sales of $200,000, before any profit is taken out. You might make a yearly profit of $90,000 if you became an accountant and leased out the business, since you would earn $40,000 in salary and $50,000 in rental revenue. For this reason, rather of running a bike shop and making just $80,000 a year, you could consider becoming an accountant and renting out the business.
