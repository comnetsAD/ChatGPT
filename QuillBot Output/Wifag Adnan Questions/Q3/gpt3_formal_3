To evaluate whether you should continue operating the bike business, you should compare the earnings you would get from the bike store to the profits you would earn if you became an accountant and leased out the store. You generate a profit of $80,000 per year from the bike business, given its annual sales of $200,000 and expenditures of $100,000 for the bikes and $20,000 for energy, taxes, and other expenses. If you become a certified public accountant and leased out the business, you would make a salary of $40,000 per year and rental income of $50,000 per year, for a total annual profit of $90,000. Therefore, you should lease the business and become a certified public accountant, since doing so would result in a larger annual profit of $90,000 compared to $80,000 from managing the bike store.
