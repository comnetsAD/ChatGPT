To decide whether you should keep running the bike business, compare its revenues to those of becoming an accountant and renting out the store. The bike shop makes $80,000 per year after expenditures of $100,000 for bikes and $20,000 for power, taxes, and other charges. If you became an accountant and leased out the business, you would make $40,000 in salary and $50,000 in rental income, making $90,000. Thus, renting out the shop and becoming an accountant would yield $90,000 a year, compared to $80,000 from running the bike store.
