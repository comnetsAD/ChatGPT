You should compare the projected earnings from operating the bike shop against the expected pay of an accountant and the rental revenue from renting the business in order to decide whether or not you should continue to operate the bike store. The following are some of the anticipated benefits of operating the bike shop: $200,000 in annual revenue minus $100,000 in annual expenses equals $80,000 annually. The annual compensation that one may anticipate receiving as an accountant is $40,000. The rental revenue that is anticipated to be generated from the shop is $50,000 per year. It would seem, in light of the evidence shown here, that running one's own bike shop would result in more financial success than either becoming an accountant or renting one's own shop. The anticipated annual profit of $80,000 from operating the bike business is far more than the anticipated annual pay of an accountant or the revenue from rental property. Therefore, continuing to run the bike business would be more advantageous for you to do in the long run.
