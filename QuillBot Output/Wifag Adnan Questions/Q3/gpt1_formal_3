The choice of whether to continue running the bike shop or become a certified public accountant and rent the business to a clothes retail chain hinges on the relative profitability of the two possibilities. To determine the bike shop's profitability, we may compute the net profit, which is the sales less the expenses. The annual net profit of the bicycle shop is $80,000, or $200,000 minus 100,000 minus 20,000. If you become a certified public accountant, your annual compensation will be $40,000 and you will not have to pay for the store's expenditures. If you rented the business to the clothes retail chain, you would earn annual rent of $50,000, which is more than the bike shop's net income. Therefore, if you want to optimize your income, it would be more lucrative to rent the shop to the retail chain, which would provide an annual income of $50,000. To make a smart choice, it is vital to analyze all available alternatives, expenses, and revenues.
