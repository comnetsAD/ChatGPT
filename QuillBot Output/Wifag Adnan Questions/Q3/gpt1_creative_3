Whether or not to become an accountant and rent the shop to the clothes retail chain is a choice that must be made in light of the two alternatives' respective profitability. Net profit, or revenue minus expenses, may be used as a measure of the bike shop's financial health. Based on annual sales of $200,000, after deducting $100,000, $20,000 in expenses, and taxes, the bike shop sees an annual net profit of $80,000. You may avoid the overhead of running a business and earn $40k annually by pursuing a career in accounting. The apparel retail chain's annual rent of $50,000 would exceed the bike shop's annual net profit of $24,000. Renting the business out to the retail chain would provide an additional $50,000 in annual income, making it the most financially advantageous option. In order to make a wise choice, it is vital to weigh all of the potential outcomes with the associated costs and potential returns.
