When deciding whether or not to keep the bike shop open, it's important to weigh the projected earnings against the cost of hiring an accountant and losing the rent money. This bike shop anticipates the following returns on investment: yearly profit = $80,000 (revenue less expenses of $200,000 minus $100,000 minus $20,000). The average annual wage for an accountant is $40,000. Retail leases often bring in about $50,000 annually. This data suggests that running the bike shop rather than switching careers or leasing the space would provide the most returns. Compared to hiring an accountant or collecting rent, the estimated yearly earnings from the bike shop is $80,000 greater. Therefore, it is in your best interest to keep the bike shop open.
