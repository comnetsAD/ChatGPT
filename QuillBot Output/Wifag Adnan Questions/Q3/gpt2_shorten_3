Against decide whether you should keep operating the bike business, compare the predicted profits to the expected accountant pay and the rental revenue. The bike retailer should make: Revenue minus costs = $80,000 per year. Accountants earn $40,000. The shop rents for $50,000 per year. This suggests that running a bike shop is more lucrative than becoming an accountant or renting the business. The bike store's $80,000 annual profit exceeds the accountant's pay and rental revenue. Thus, running the bike shop is better for you.
