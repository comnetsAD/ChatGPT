Compare the earnings you would make from the bike shop to the profits you would make if you become an accountant and leased out the store to decide if you should keep running the business. You make $200,000 a year from the bike shop, but your expenditures are $100,000 for the bikes and $20,000 for power, taxes, and other charges, leaving you with an annual profit of $80,000. If you decided to work as an accountant and leased out the business, you might make $90,000 year by earning a salary of $40,000 and collecting $50,000 in rental revenue. Due to the larger profit of $90,000 per year compared to $80,000 per year from owning the bike business, you should rent out the store and become an accountant.
