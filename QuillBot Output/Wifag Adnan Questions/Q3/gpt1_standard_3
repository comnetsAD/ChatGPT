The relative profitability of the two possibilities will determine whether to continue running the bike shop or to train as an accountant and lease the location to a chain of apparel retailers. We may compute the net profit, which is the income less the expenses, to assess the bike shop's profitability. The bike shop's net profit for the year is $200,000 - 100,000 - 20,000, or $80,000. If you work as an accountant, your compensation is $40,000 per year, and you are exempt from paying shop charges. Rent from renting the shop to the apparel chain would be $50,000 year, which is more than the bike business's net profit. Therefore, renting the business to the retail chain would be more advantageous if you wanted to optimize your earnings since you would get a yearly income of $50,000 by doing so. In order to make a wise choice, it's crucial to weigh all the available possibilities, expenses, and income.
