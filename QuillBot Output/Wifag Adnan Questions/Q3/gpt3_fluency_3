To decide if you should keep running the bike shop, compare the earnings you would make from it to the profits you would make if you became an accountant and leased out the business. You make $200,000 per year from the bike business, with expenditures of $100,000 for the bikes and $20,000 for power, taxes, and other charges, for a total profit of $80,000 each year. If you became an accountant and leased out the business, you would make $40,000 per year in salary and $50,000 in rental revenue, for a total profit of $90,000 per year. As a result, you should rent out the business and become an accountant, which would result in a $90,000 profit per year as opposed to $80,000 profit per year from managing the bike store.
