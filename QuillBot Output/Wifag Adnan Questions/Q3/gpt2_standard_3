Compare the predicted revenues from operating the bike shop against the anticipated pay of an accountant and the rental income from renting the store to decide if you should keep running the business. The bike shop's anticipated earnings are as follows: Revenue minus costs equals $200,000, $100,000, $20,000, or $80,000 annually. A certified public accountant should earn $40,000 annually. An annual rental revenue of $50,000 is anticipated from renting the business. This data suggests that running the bike shop would be more lucrative than working as an accountant or renting the business. In comparison to the anticipated pay of an accountant or the rental revenue, the predicted profit of $80,000 per year from operating the bike shop is larger. As a result, it would be better for you to keep running the bike shop.
