The bike shop or becoming an accountant and renting the business to the apparel retail chain relies on profitability. Net profit—revenue minus costs—can be used to assess the bike store's profitability. The bike shop makes $80,000 every year. Accountants earn $40,000 a year and don't pay shop costs. The bike store's net profit is less than the apparel shop chain's $50,000 annual rent. Thus, renting the business to the retail chain would optimize your earnings at $50,000 per year. To make a wise selection, consider all possibilities, expenses, and income.
