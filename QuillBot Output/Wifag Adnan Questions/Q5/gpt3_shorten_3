Students and instructors will purchase $5 movie tickets. Students are ready to pay $5 for a ticket, while teachers are prepared to spend $10. The movie theater will sell 900 student tickets and 100 professor seats since it cannot price discriminate. Marginal cost minus revenue yields the movie theater's profit. The movie theater will sell 1000 $5 tickets at $3 apiece, making $2000. Consumer surplus is the gap between a consumer's maximal price and their actual price. Students have a consumer surplus of $0, whereas professors have $500. Thus, the movie theater sells 1000 tickets, makes $2000, and students have $0 consumer surplus and instructors $500.
