Everyone, from students to professors, will shell out the recommended $5 for a ticket to see the latest blockbuster. The price is more than the sum of the students' and teachers' willingness to pay, which is $5 for each student and $10 for each teacher. There will be a total of 1000 tickets sold, with 900 pupils and 100 teachers purchasing a total of 1 ticket apiece. After deducting operating expenses, the net revenue of a movie theater may be determined. The profit from selling 1000 tickets at $5 apiece is $5000. The entire cost is $3000, or the marginal cost per ticket of $3. The theater's net income is $2,000 ($5,000 minus $3,000). A consumer's surplus is the amount by which the real price of an item exceeds the maximum amount a customer is prepared to pay for that thing. The professors have a $500 consumer surplus, but the students have nothing ((9005) - (9005) = $0).
