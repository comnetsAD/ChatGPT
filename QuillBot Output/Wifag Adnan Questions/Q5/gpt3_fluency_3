Both students and teachers will purchase a ticket if the movie theater costs $5 per ticket. The willingness to pay of the students is $5, and the willingness to pay of the professors is $10, thus both groups are willing to spend $5 for a ticket. The movie theater will sell 900 tickets to students and 100 seats to professors since it cannot price discriminate and charge different rates to different groups. The profit of a movie theater may be estimated by deducting the marginal cost from the revenue. The marginal cost of a ticket is $3, and if the movie theater sells 1000 tickets at $5 each, the profit is (1000)($5 - $3) = $2000. The difference between the highest amount a customer is prepared to pay for an item and the actual price they pay is known as consumer surplus. The consumer surplus for students is (900)($5 - $5) = $0, whereas the consumer surplus for professors is (100)($10 - $5) = $500. As a result, the movie theater will sell 1000 tickets, earn $2000 in profit, and have a consumer surplus of $0 for students and $500 for professors.
