If the price of a movie ticket is $5, both students and instructors will purchase one. Both parties are willing to pay $5 for a ticket, since the students' willingness to pay is $5 and the professors' desire to pay is $10. Since the movie theater is unable to charge various rates to different groups, it will offer 900 student tickets and 100 professor tickets. The profit of the movie theater may be determined by deducting the marginal cost from the revenue. The marginal cost per ticket is $3, and the theater will sell 1,000 tickets at $5 each, resulting in a profit of (1,000)($5 - $3) = $2,000. Customer surplus is the gap between the highest amount a consumer would be prepared to pay for an item and the price they actually pay. The consumer surplus for students is (900)($5 - $5) = $0, whereas the consumer surplus for professors is (100)($10 - $5) = $500. Therefore, the movie theater will sell 1,000 tickets, generate a profit of $2,000, and the consumer surplus for students will be $0, while the surplus for professors will be $500.
