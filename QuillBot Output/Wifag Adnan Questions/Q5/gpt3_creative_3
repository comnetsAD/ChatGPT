Professors and students alike are willing to pay $5 for a movie ticket. Two groups are ready to pay the same amount for a ticket, with students willing to pay $5 and academics willing to pay $10. The theater can't charge various rates for different groups of people, so it'll sell 900 seats to students and 100 tickets to professors. The profit of the cinema may be estimated by taking the revenue and deducting the marginal cost. Assuming the theater can sell 1,000 tickets at $5 apiece, its net profit would be $2,000 (1,000 * ($5 * $3)). A consumer's surplus is the amount by which the price of an item or service exceeds the consumer's greatest willingness to pay for it. The consumer surplus is $0 for the students and $500 for the professors after accounting for price differences of $10 and $5. So, if the theater can sell a thousand tickets at $10 each, it will earn $2,000, with no consumer surplus from students and a surplus of $500 from teachers.
