The movie theater cannot charge professors and students different rates for movie tickets, thus it must charge both groups the same amount. If a movie theater costs $5 a ticket, both students and faculty members are willing to pay more than the ticket price. Therefore, both students and faculty will purchase tickets. There are 900 students and 100 professors in town, and everyone will purchase one ticket, thus the movie theater will sell a total of 900 + 100 = 1000 tickets. The profit of the movie theater will equal the revenue less the expenditures. The profit will be $5000 minus $3000, or $2000, since the income will be $5,000 and the expenses will be $3,000. Consumer surplus is the gap between the consumer's voluntary and actual payment. The consumer surplus for the students will be $5 - $5 = $0, whereas for the professors it will be $10 - $5 = $5. The aggregate consumer surplus will be $5 ($0 plus $5).
