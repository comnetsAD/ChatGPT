The movie theater must charge the same amount for a movie ticket to both students and academics since it is against the law to price discriminate. Students are ready to pay more than the ticket price, and professors are also prepared to pay more than the ticket price if the movie theater costs $5 each ticket. As a result, both teachers and students will purchase tickets. Since there are 900 students and 100 professors in town, the movie theater will sell 900 + 100 = 1000 tickets since each individual will only purchase one. The income less the expenses equals the movie theater's profit. The profit will be $5000 - $3000 = $2000 because the income will be $5 x 1000 = $5000 and the expenses will be $3 x 1000 = $3000. The gap between the price a customer is prepared to pay and the price they ultimately pay is known as the consumer surplus. Consumer surplus for the professors will be $10 - $5 = $5, while it will be $0 for the students. Consumer surplus will equal $0 plus $5 for a total of $5.
