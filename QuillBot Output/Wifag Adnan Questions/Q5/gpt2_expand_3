Because the movie theater is not permitted to engage in price discrimination by charging students and professors different rates for tickets to the same film, it will be required to charge the same price for a movie ticket to both groups. If a ticket at the movie theater costs five dollars, then both students and teachers are willing to spend more than the ticket price to see the film. Therefore, both students and instructors will be purchasing tickets for the event. Since there are 900 students and 100 professors in town, the movie theater will sell 900 plus 100, which is a total of 1000 tickets due to the fact that each individual will only purchase one ticket. The difference between the income and the expenditures will be the movie theater's profit. Given that the expenditures will amount to $3 x 1000, or $3000, and the income will amount to $5 x 1000, or $5000, the profit will be $5000 minus $3000, or $2000. The term "consumer surplus" refers to the gap between the amount that consumers are prepared to pay and the amount that they actually pay for goods and services. The consumer surplus for the students will equal $0 (five dollars subtracted from five dollars), whereas the consumer surplus for the professors will equal $5 (ten dollars subtracted from five dollars). The overall consumer surplus will equal $5, which is the same as 0 plus $5.
