Students and teachers will both purchase tickets if the movie theater costs $5 per ticket. The desire to pay is more than the price of $5, with each student wanting to pay $5 and each professor willing to pay $10. Since each buyer will only purchase one ticket, a total of 1000 tickets will be sold thanks to the purchases of 900 students and 100 teachers. By collecting the money from ticket sales and deducting the expenditures, the theater's profit may be determined. 1000 tickets at $5 each generate $5000 in income. The total cost is $3000 since each ticket has a marginal cost of $3. As a result, the movie theater made a profit of $2000 ($5000 â€“ $3,000). Consumer surplus is the discrepancy between the utmost price consumers would be prepared to pay and the amount they actually pay. In this instance, the consumer surplus for the professors is (10010) - (1005) = $500 while the consumer surplus for the students is (9005) - (9005) = $0.
