A movie theater can't charge different pricing to professors and students, therefore it must set its ticket prices at the same level for everyone. If a movie costs $5, both students and teachers would be ready to spend extra. Professors and students alike will thus purchase tickets. Assuming that each of the 900 students and 100 professors in town only buys one ticket, the theater will make a profit of $1,000. The profit for the cinema may be calculated by subtracting the income from the expenditures. Five dollars multiplied by a thousand dollars is $5,000. If expenses are three dollars multiplied by a thousand dollars, then the profit is $2,000. The term "consumer surplus" refers to the amount of money left over after all costs have been covered. The pupils' consumer surplus will be zero dollars ($5 minus $5), whereas the teachers' surplus will be five dollars ($10 minus $5). A amount of $5 will be in the hands of consumers as a surplus, as opposed to nothing.
