If the price of a movie ticket is $5, both students and instructors will purchase tickets. The price is larger than $5 because each student's desire to pay is $5 and each professor's willingness to pay is $10. Since each individual will purchase just one ticket, 900 students and 100 professors will purchase a total of 1000 tickets. The profit of the movie theater may be estimated by subtracting ticket sales income from operating expenses. The income generated by selling 1000 tickets at $5 apiece is $5000. The total cost is $3000 since the marginal cost each ticket is $3. Therefore, the profit for the movie theater is $5000 - $3000 = $2000. Consumer surplus is the difference between the utmost price consumers are prepared to pay for an item and the amount they actually pay for it. In this instance, the students' consumer surplus is equal to zero dollars, whereas the professors' consumer surplus is equal to five hundred dollars.
