Both students and instructors will purchase a ticket if the movie theater costs $5 per ticket. Both parties are willing to pay $5 for a ticket, with the students ready to pay $5 and the academics willing to pay $10. The movie theater will offer 900 tickets to students and 100 seats to professors since it is against the law for it to charge different rates to different groups. The margin cost must be subtracted from the revenue to determine the theater's profit. The movie theater will make a profit of $2000 if it sells 1000 tickets at $5 each while having a marginal cost per ticket of $3. The difference between the utmost price a customer is prepared to pay and the final price they pay is known as the consumer surplus. The consumer surplus for students is (900)($5 - $5) = $0, whereas the consumer surplus for professors is (100)($10 - $5) = $500. Therefore, the movie theater will sell 1000 tickets, turn a $2000 profit, and the consumer surplus for students and professors will be $0 and $500, respectively.
