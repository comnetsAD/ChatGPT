Students and professors must pay the same movie ticket price since the theater can't price discriminate. Students and teachers are prepared to spend more than $5 per movie ticket. Students and lecturers will purchase tickets. Since 900 students and 100 professors will each buy one ticket, the movie theater will sell 1000 tickets. Revenue minus expenditures equals movie theater profit. $5 x 1000 = $5000, $3 x 1000 = $3000, hence the profit will be $2000. Customer surplus is the gap between consumer willingness and actual payment. Consumer surplus will be $5 - $5 = $0 for students and $10 - $5 = $5 for professors. $0 + $5 Equals $5 consumer surplus.
