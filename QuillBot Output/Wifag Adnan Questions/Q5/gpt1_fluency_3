Students and teachers will both purchase tickets if the movie theater costs $5 per ticket. Each student is willing to pay $5, whereas each professor is willing to pay $10, which is more than the price of $5. Because each individual will only purchase one ticket, 900 students and 100 professors will purchase tickets, resulting in a total of 1000 tickets sold. The profit of a movie theater may be estimated by subtracting the income from ticket sales from the expenses. The total income from 1000 $5 tickets sold is $5000. The total cost is $3000 since the marginal cost each ticket is $3. As a result, the profit of the movie theater is $5000 - $3000 = $2000. The difference between the utmost price customers are prepared to pay for an item and the actual amount they pay is known as consumer surplus. The students' consumer surplus in this scenario is (9005) - (9005) = $0, whereas the professors' consumer surplus is (10010) - (1005) = $500.
