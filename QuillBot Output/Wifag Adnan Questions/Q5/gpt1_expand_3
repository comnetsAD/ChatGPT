Both students and teachers are likely to pay the $5 per ticket that the movie theater requires in order to enter. The amount of money that each student is willing to pay is $5, but the amount of money that each professor is willing to spend is $10, which is more than the price of $5. Because just one ticket will be purchased by each individual, there will be a total of one thousand tickets sold, with 900 pupils and 100 teachers purchasing them. To determine how much of a profit the movie theater made, start by calculating the income from ticket sales and deducting the expenses from that total. The total amount of money made from the sale of 1000 tickets at $5 each is $5000. The total cost is $3,000, which is derived from the fact that the marginal cost of each ticket is $3. As a result, the movie theater made a profit of $5,000 after subtracting $3,000 from its total revenue. The difference between the most expensive price that customers are prepared to pay for a product and the price that they actually pay for that product is known as the consumer surplus. In this particular scenario, the consumer surplus of the professors is equal to (10010) minus (1005) = $500, whereas the consumer surplus of the students is equal to (9005) minus (9005) = $0.
