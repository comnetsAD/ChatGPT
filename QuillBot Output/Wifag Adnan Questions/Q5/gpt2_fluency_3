The movie theater cannot price discriminate and offer different pricing to students and professors, thus both groups must pay the same amount for a movie ticket. If the movie theater costs $5 per ticket, the students and professors are both prepared to pay more than the ticket price. As a result, both students and instructors will purchase tickets. Because there are 900 students and 100 professors in town, the movie theater will sell 900 + 100 = 1000 tickets because each individual will only purchase one ticket. The profit of the movie theater will be the revenue less the expenditures. Because the income is $5 x 1000 = $5000 and the expenditures are $3 x 1000 = $3000, the profit is $5000 - $3000 = $2000. The gap between what a customer is prepared to pay and what they actually pay is known as consumer surplus. Consumer surplus for students will be $5 - $5 = $0, whereas consumer surplus for professors will be $10 - $5 = $5. The overall consumer surplus will be equal to $0 + $5 = $5.
