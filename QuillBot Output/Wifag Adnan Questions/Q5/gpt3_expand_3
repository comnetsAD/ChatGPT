Both students and professors are likely to purchase a ticket to the movie even if it costs $5 a seat at the theater. Both the students and the professors are willing to pay $5 for a ticket, since the students' willingness to pay is $5 and the professors' readiness to pay is $10, respectively. The movie theater will sell 900 tickets to students and 100 seats to professors since it is not allowed to engage in price discrimination and cannot charge different rates to different groups. The profit made by the movie theater may be determined by taking the revenue and deducting the marginal cost from that number. Since the movie theater will sell 1000 tickets at a price of $5 each, and the marginal cost of each ticket is $3, the profit will be equal to (1000)($5 - $3), which is $2000. The term "consumer surplus" refers to the gap between the most money a customer is willing to spend on an item and the amount of money the consumer actually spends for that good. The consumer surplus for the students is calculated as (900)($5 - $5), which equals $0, whereas the consumer surplus for the professors is calculated as (100)($10 - $5), which equals $500. As a result, the movie theater will sell a thousand tickets, resulting in a profit of $2,000; however, the consumer surplus for students will be zero dollars, while it will be five hundred dollars for professors.
