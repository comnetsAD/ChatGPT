A price ceiling is the utmost amount that may be charged legally for an item or service. The price cap in this instance is set at $2. The gap between the utmost price customers are prepared to pay and the price they actually pay for a commodity is known as the consumer surplus. The quantity required at various prices may be calculated using the demand equation. The quantity requested at a price of $2 would be QD = 10 - 2(2) = 6. Quantity demanded would be QD = 10 - 2(0) = 10 if the price was $0. The region between the demand curve and the price ceiling may be used to determine the consumer surplus. A triangle with a base of 4 (10-6) and a height of 2 may be used to represent this region, yielding a consumer surplus of 4. The loss of economic efficiency brought on by a market distortion, such as a price cap, is known as the deadweight loss. The difference between the amount delivered and the quantity sought at the price ceiling may be used to compute the deadweight loss. The amount specified in this instance is QS = 2P = 2(2) = 4. QD = 6 and QS = 4, hence the deadweight loss is 2 since 6-4. In conclusion, the deadweight loss is equal to 2, and the consumer surplus equals 4.
