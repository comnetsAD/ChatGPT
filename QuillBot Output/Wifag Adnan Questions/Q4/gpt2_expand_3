A price ceiling is a pricing limit established by the government that establishes a legal maximum price for an item or service. When a price ceiling of $2 is established, the amount sought will exceed the quantity offered at that price. Demand: QD = 10 - 2P Quantity: QS = 2P The $2 price cap results in a price of $2. By plugging this price into the demand equation, we can get the desired quantity: QD = 10 - 2P = 10 - 2(2) = 6 Entering a $2 price into the supply equation yields the amount supplied: QS = 2P = 2(2) = 4 The consumer surplus is the gap between the highest amount customers are prepared to pay and the price they actually pay for a commodity or service. Consumers are ready to pay $8 for an item or service priced at $2, hence the consumer surplus is (8-2) * (6-4) = 24. The deadweight loss is the difference between the overall surplus that the market would have created and the total surplus after the price ceiling. The deadweight loss is the loss of consumer and producer surplus, and it may be computed as the area of the triangle formed by the market price, the price ceiling, and the amount provided. The deadweight loss is equal to 0 (1/2) * (6-4) * (2-2). In conclusion, the consumer surplus is 24 and there is no deadweight loss.
