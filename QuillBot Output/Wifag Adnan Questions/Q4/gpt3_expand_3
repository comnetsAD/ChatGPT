Students and teachers will both purchase tickets if the movie theater costs $5 per ticket. Each student is willing to pay $5, whereas each professor is willing to pay $10, which is more than the price of $5. Because each individual will only purchase one ticket, 900 students and 100 professors will purchase tickets, resulting in a total of 1000 tickets sold. The profit of a movie theater may be estimated by subtracting the income from ticket sales from the expenses. The total income from 1000 $5 tickets sold is $5000. The total cost is $3000 since the marginal cost each ticket is $3. As a result, the profit of the movie theater is $5000 - $3000 = $2000. The difference between the utmost price customers are prepared to pay for an item and the actual amount they pay is known as consumer surplus. The students' consumer surplus in this scenario is (9005) - (9005) = $0, whereas the professors' consumer surplus is (10010) - (1005) = $500. GTP2 The movie theater cannot price discriminate and offer different pricing to students and professors, thus both groups must pay the same amount for a movie ticket. If the movie theater costs $5 per ticket, the students and professors are both prepared to pay more than the ticket price. As a result, both students and instructors will purchase tickets. Because there are 900 students and 100 professors in town, the movie theater will sell 900 + 100 = 1000 tickets because each individual will only purchase one ticket. The profit of the movie theater will be the revenue less the expenditures. Because the income is $5 x 1000 = $5000 and the expenditures are $3 x 1000 = $3000, the profit is $5000 - $3000 = $2000. The gap between what a customer is prepared to pay and what they actually pay is known as consumer surplus. Consumer surplus for students will be $5 - $5 = $0, whereas consumer surplus for professors will be $10 - $5 = $5. The overall consumer surplus will be equal to $0 + $5 = $5.
