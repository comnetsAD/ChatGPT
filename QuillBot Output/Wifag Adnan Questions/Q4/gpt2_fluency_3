A price ceiling is a pricing limit established by the government that establishes a legal maximum price for an item or service. When a price ceiling of $2 is imposed, the quantity sought exceeds the amount provided at that price. QD = 10 - 2P = Demand QS Equals 2P in terms of supply. A price of $2 arises from a price ceiling of $2. We can calculate the amount requested by plugging this price into the demand equation: QD = 10 - 2P = 10 - 2(2) = 6 We can calculate the amount delivered by plugging the price of $2 into the supply equation: QS = 2P = 2(2) = 4 The consumer surplus is the gap between the highest amount customers are prepared to pay and the price they actually pay for a commodity or service. Consumers are ready to pay $8 for the item and service at a price of $2, hence the consumer surplus is (8-2) * (6-4) = 24. The deadweight loss is the difference between the market's overall surplus and the total surplus after the price ceiling. The deadweight loss is the loss of both consumer and producer surplus and is measured as the area of the triangle formed by the market price, the price ceiling, and the amount provided. (1/2) * (6-4) * (2-2) = 0 deadweight loss In conclusion, the consumer surplus is 24 and the deadweight loss is zero.
