A legal price cap limits the price of a product or service. This price limit is $2. Consumer surplus is the gap between consumers' maximum price for an item and their actual price. The demand equation calculates quantity requested at various prices. QD is 10 - 2(2) = 6 at $2. QD = 10 - 2(0) = 10 at $0 pricing. Between the demand curve and the price ceiling is the consumer surplus. A triangle with a base of 4 (10-6) and a height of 2 yields a consumer surplus of 4. Market distortions like price ceilings cause deadweight loss, which reduces economic efficiency. The deadweight loss is the discrepancy between supply and demand at the price ceiling. QS = 2P = 2(2) = 4. Deadweight loss is 2 because QD = 6 and QS = 4. Consumer surplus is 4 and deadweight loss is 2.
