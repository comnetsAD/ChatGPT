A price ceiling is the highest allowed selling price for a product or service under law. Here, we cap the price at $2. A consumer's surplus is the amount by which the price they actually pay for a commodity exceeds their greatest willingness to pay for it. The demand equation allows us to determine the quantity requested at various price points. QD = 10 - 2(2) = 6 at a $2 pricing point. QD = 10 - 2(0) = 10 is the quantity demanded at a price of $0. As the distance from the demand curve to the ceiling price, the consumer surplus may be determined. The consumer surplus in this region is equal to four times the area, which may be represented by a triangle with a base of four (10-6) and a height of two (2). When a market distortion, such as a price ceiling, occurs, it causes a loss of economic efficiency known as deadweight loss. Difference between supply and demand at the equilibrium price is the deadweight loss. Quantity specified here is QS = 2P = 2(2) = 4, which is the default value. QD = 6, QS = 4, hence the deadweight loss is 6-4 = 2. To sum up, we have a deadweight loss of 2 and a consumer surplus of 4.
