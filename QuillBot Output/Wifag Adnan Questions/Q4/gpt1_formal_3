A price ceiling is the legal maximum that may be charged for a product or service. In this instance, the maximum price is $2. Consumer surplus is the difference between the utmost price consumers are prepared to pay for an item and the price they actually pay. Using the demand equation, the amount requested at various prices may be calculated. Quantity demanded would be QD = 10 - 2(2) = 6 at a price of $2. If the price were $0, the demand would be QD = 10 - 2(0) = 10 The consumer surplus is the region between the demand curve and the price ceiling. This region approximates a triangle with a base of four (10-6) and a height of two (2), yielding a consumer surplus of four. The deadweight loss is the reduction in economic efficiency caused by market distortions, such as price ceilings. Calculate the deadweight loss by subtracting the amount delivered from the quantity sought at the price ceiling. QS = 2P = 2(2) = 4 is the amount delivered in this instance. QD = 6 and QS = 4, therefore 6-4 = 2 is the deadweight loss. In conclusion, the consumer surplus is four dollars and the deadweight loss is two.
