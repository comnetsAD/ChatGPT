A price ceiling is a legal limit on how much an item or service may be sold for. The price limit in this scenario is set at $2. The consumer surplus is the gap between the highest price consumers are prepared to pay for an item and the actual price they pay. We can compute the amount required at various prices using the demand equation. The quantity demanded for a price of $2 is QD = 10 - 2(2) = 6. If the price is 0 dollars, the quantity requested is QD = 10 - 2(0) = 10. The area between the demand curve and the price ceiling may be used to determine the consumer surplus. This region is roughly represented by a triangle with a base of 4 (10-6) and a height of 2, yielding a consumer surplus of 4. The deadweight loss is the reduction in economic efficiency caused by a market distortion, such as a price ceiling. The difference between the amount delivered and the quantity sought at the price ceiling is the deadweight loss. In this situation, the provided amount is QS = 2P = 2(2) = 4. The deadweight loss is 6-4 = 2 since QD = 6 and QS = 4. In conclusion, the consumer surplus is four and the deadweight loss is two.
