A price cap is a price restriction imposed by the government that establishes a product or service's maximum permitted cost. The amount required will exceed the quantity provided when the price ceiling is set at $2. Demand: 10 - 2P = QD Provider: QS = 2P The $2 pricing is the outcome of the $2 price cap. We may calculate the amount requested by entering this price into the demand equation: QD = 10 - 2P = 10 - 2(2) = 6 When we enter a $2 price into the supply equation, we can calculate the amount delivered as follows: QS = 2P = 2(2) = 4 Consumer surplus is the gap between the utmost price consumers are prepared to pay and the price they actually pay for an item or service. Consumers are ready to pay $8 for the item and service at the price of $2, hence the consumer surplus is equal to (8-2) * (6-4) = 24. The difference between the entire surplus produced by the market and the total surplus after the price ceiling is known as the deadweight loss. The area of the triangle formed by the market price, the price ceiling, and the amount provided may be used to compute the deadweight loss, which is the loss of both consumer surplus and producer surplus. Deadweight loss equals (1/2) * (6-4) * (2-2), which equals zero. In conclusion, the deadweight loss is zero and the consumer surplus is 24.
