A price ceiling is the statutory limit placed by law on the highest possible selling price of a product or service. In this scenario, the highest possible price is capped at $2. The consumer surplus may be defined as the gap between the most that customers are prepared to pay for a product and the amount that those customers actually pay for that product. We are able to compute the amount of anything that is requested at a variety of prices by using the demand equation. If the product were sold for $2, the quantity that customers would want to buy would be QD = 10 - 2(2) = 6. If the price were zero, the quantity requested would be QD = 10 - 2(0) = 10, which is the same as the current price. It is possible to compute the consumer surplus by finding the region that is between the demand curve and the price ceiling. This region may be represented by an approximation of a triangle with a base of four (10-6) and a height of two, which results in a consumer surplus of four. A price ceiling is an example of a market distortion that may lead to deadweight loss, which refers to the loss of economic efficiency that can occur as a consequence of the distortion. The difference between the amount that is delivered and the quantity that is required at the price ceiling is the difference that may be used to determine the deadweight loss. In this particular scenario, the amount delivered is denoted by the equation QS = 2P = 2(2) = 4. Given that QD is equal to 6 and QS to 4, the deadweight loss is calculated to be 6-4 = 2. In a nutshell, the consumer surplus comes in at 4 whereas the deadweight loss comes in at 2.
