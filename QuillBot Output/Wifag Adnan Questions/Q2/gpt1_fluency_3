False. The assertion is erroneous because it only examines the marginal value of each item rather than the overall utility and the professor's financial constraints. The optimum consumption bundle can only be established by taking into consideration the budget restriction and the marginal utility of the items, as well as the law of declining marginal utility, which says that as more units of a commodity are consumed, its marginal value decreases.
