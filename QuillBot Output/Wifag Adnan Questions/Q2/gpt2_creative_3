The fact that the professor's marginal utility for 10 economics books and 50 cups of coffee per week is 75 and 3, respectively, does not prove that this is the optimum consumption bundle for the professor. The marginal utility is just one factor to consider when deciding on the best package to meet a consumer's demands and preferences.
