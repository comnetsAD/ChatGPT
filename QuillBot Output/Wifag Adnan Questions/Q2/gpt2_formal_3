False. The fact that MU(E) = 75 and MU(C) = 3 for the consumption bundle of 10 economics books and 50 cups of coffee per week does not mean that this bundle maximizes the professor's utility and is his optimum consumption bundle. The marginal utility alone is insufficient to identify the optimum bundle; the budget restriction and the consumer's preferences must also be considered.
