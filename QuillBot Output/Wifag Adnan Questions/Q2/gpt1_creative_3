False. The statement is incorrect because it focuses only on the marginal usefulness of each item, rather than the professor's overall utility and financial constraints. The law of declining marginal utility asserts that when more units of an item are used, the marginal usefulness of that good will decline, hence balancing the budget constraint with the marginal utility of the goods is necessary to establish the optimum consumption bundle.
