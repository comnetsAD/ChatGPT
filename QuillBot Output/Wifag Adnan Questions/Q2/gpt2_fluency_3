False. The fact that the marginal utility of each product is such that MU(E) = 75 and MU(C) = 3 at the consumption bundle of 10 economics books and 50 cups of coffee per week does not suggest that this is the professor's optimum consumption bundle. The marginal utility alone is insufficient to establish the best bundle; one must additionally consider the budget limitation and the consumer's preferences.
