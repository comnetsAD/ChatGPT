False. The assertion is not accurate since it takes into account just the marginal usefulness of each item rather than the overall utility of the professor as well as the constraints of their budget. It is only possible to determine the optimal consumption bundle by taking into account the budget constraint, the marginal utility of the goods, and the law of diminishing marginal utility. This law states that the marginal utility of a good will decrease as more units of that good are consumed. In order to determine the optimal consumption bundle, it is necessary to take into account all of these factors.
