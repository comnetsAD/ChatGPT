False. The fact that the marginal utility associated with each good is such that MU(E) = 75 and MU(C) = 3 at the consumption bundle of 10 economics books and 50 cups of coffee per week does not imply that this bundle maximizes the professor's utility and is his optimal consumption bundle. Instead, it merely indicates that this bundle contains the two goods that provide him with the highest marginal utility. It is not sufficient to identify the best bundle based just on the marginal utility; in addition, one must take into consideration the consumer's preferences as well as any financial constraints that may exist.
