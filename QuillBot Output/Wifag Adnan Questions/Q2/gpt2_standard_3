False. The fact that the marginal utility for each good at the consumption bundle of 10 economics books and 50 cups of coffee per week is such that MU(E) = 75 and MU(C) = 3 does not indicate that this bundle optimizes the professor's value or that it is his ideal consumption bundle. The budgetary restrictions and the preferences of the customer must be taken into consideration in addition to the marginal utility when determining the best package.
