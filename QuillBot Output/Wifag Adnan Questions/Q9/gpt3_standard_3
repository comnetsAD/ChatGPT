Cost of Perrier as a whole: TC P = 2q P + 1. Evian's total price is TC E = 2q E + 1. What is the game's Nash equilibrium? Can the cooperative solution be reached if the businesses only engage once? Describe your response. In this game's Nash equilibrium, each business is producing the amount of water that optimizes their profit in light of the other firm's production strategy. Since this is the combination of quantities that maximizes the profit of both organizations, the Nash equilibrium in this situation is for both businesses to create 2.5 million bottles of water. When each company produces 2.5 million water bottles, the market price is P = 10 - (2.5 + 2.5) = 5, and each company's total revenue is TR = P * q = 5 * 2.5 = 13.75. Each business would have a total cost of TC = 2q + 1 = 2 * 2.5 + 1 = 6.25 and a profit of TR - TC = 13.75 - 6.25 = 7.5. The cooperative solution cannot be reached if the enterprises only communicate once. Because there is no way to enforce the cartel agreement and no way to penalize cheating in a one-shot game, each company is motivated to create more than 2 million water bottles in order to boost its profit. As both businesses have no motivation to adjust their production volumes after they have established the equilibrium, the Nash Equilibrium solution is the only stable result.
