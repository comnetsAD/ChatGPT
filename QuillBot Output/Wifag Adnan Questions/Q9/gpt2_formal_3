The Nash equilibrium of this game is a condition in which neither company has an incentive to modify its strategy in light of the strategy of the other business. In this situation, the Nash equilibrium occurs when both businesses create 2 million bottles of water, as neither company has an incentive to produce more than 2 million bottles. This is because if one company produces 2.5 million bottles while the other company produces 2 million bottles, the company producing 2.5 million bottles will experience a loss in profit while the other company would experience a gain in profit. At the Nash Equilibrium, each firm's profit is $6 million (total revenue of 12 million minus total cost of 6 million). In this situation, the cooperative solution cannot be reached if the enterprises communicate just once. This is due to the fact that the companies will not be able to maintain the partnership for an extended length of time. In other words, if the businesses only engage once, they cannot guarantee that the other company would honor the collaboration agreement in the future. Consequently, each company will have an incentive to violate the agreement and create 2.5 million bottles of water in order to maximize its own profit.
