This game's Nash Equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each business, in which neither firm can increase its payout by altering its strategy while the other firm's approach stays unchanged. Because both enterprises would prefer to create 2 million bottles of water, the Nash Equilibrium is (q P = 2, q E = 2). At this point, neither business can raise its profit by altering its strategy while the strategy of the other firm stays constant. If Perrier increased its output to 2.5 million bottles, its profit would fall from 7 to 6.25, but Evian's profit would stay same. Similarly, if Evian increased its output to 2.5 million bottles, its profit would fall from 7.25 to 6.25, but Perrier's profit would stay constant. The cooperative solution (q P = 2.5, q E = 2.5) cannot be reached if the businesses only interact once. In the collaborative arrangement, both companies would manufacture 2.5 million bottles of water, maximizing their shared profit to 7.5 million. However, since corporations cannot coordinate their actions, the only way for them to reach a cooperative solution is if they commit to the plan, which they do not. Because companies are rational, they will select the approach that maximizes their own profit, thus the Nash Equilibrium in this instance is (q P = 2, q E = 2), which differs from the cooperative solution.
