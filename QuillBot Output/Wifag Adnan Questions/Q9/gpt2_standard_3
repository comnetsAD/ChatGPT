In the Nash equilibrium of this game, neither company is motivated to alter its strategy in light of the other business's approach. Given that neither company has an incentive to create more than 2 million bottles of water, the Nash equilibrium in this situation occurs when both companies produce 2 million bottles of water. This is due to the fact that the business producing 2.5 million bottles will experience a loss in profit while the firm generating 2 million bottles will experience an increase in profit. In the Nash equilibrium, each company makes six million dollars (total revenue of 12 million minus total cost of 6 million). If the businesses only interact once, the cooperative solution in this situation cannot be realized. This is due to the businesses' inability to maintain their collaboration over an extended period of time. In other words, if the companies only work together once, there is no way for one company to guarantee that the other would uphold the terms of the collaboration agreement going forward. As a result, each company will be motivated to break the terms of the deal and make 2.5 million bottles of water apiece in order to increase its own profit.
