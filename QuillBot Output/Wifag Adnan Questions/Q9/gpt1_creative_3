For this game to reach its Nash Equilibrium, both firms must adopt strategies that prevent one from increasing its payout by switching tactics while the other maintains its current one. Since both companies would rather create 2 million bottles of water, the Nash Equilibrium is (q P = 2, q E = 2). Neither company can improve its profit by modifying its strategy while the other company's approach stays unchanged after the two reach equilibrium. If Perrier doubled its output to 2.5 million bottles, its profit would drop from $7 to $6.25 but Evian's would stay the same. Evian's profit drops from $7 to $6.25 per bottle if output increases to 2.5 million, whereas Perrier's profit stays the same at $7.5 per bottle. Cooperation (q P = 2.5, q E = 2.5) is not possible if companies solely communicate with one another. To maximize their combined profit of $7.5 million, the two companies would work together to generate 2.5 million bottles of water. Firms can't reach the cooperative solution since they can't agree on a unified approach, which they can't do because of the lack of coordination. Due to the businesses' innate self-interest, the Nash Equilibrium in this scenario is (q P = 2, q E = 2), which is not the same as the cooperative solution.
