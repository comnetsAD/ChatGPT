Total Perrier cost: TC P = 2q P + 1 Evian's total cost is TC E = 2q E + 1. What is the game's Nash Equilibrium? Can the cooperative solution be accomplished if the businesses only interact once? Explain your response. This game's Nash Equilibrium is a condition in which one business produces the amount of water that maximizes their profit given the other firm's choice of production. In this situation, the Nash Equilibrium is for both enterprises to manufacture 2.5 million bottles of water since this is the quantity combination that maximizes both firms' profits. When both businesses produce 2.5 million bottles of water, the market price is P = 10 - (2.5 + 2.5) = 5, and each firm's total revenue is TR = P * q = 5 * 2.5 = 13.75. Each firm's total cost would be TC = 2q + 1 = 2 * 2.5 + 1 = 6.25, and its profit would be TR - TC = 13.75 - 6.25 = 7.5. The cooperative solution cannot be reached if the businesses only interact once. Because there is no mechanism for enforcing the cartel agreement and no prospect of penalty for cheating in a one-shot game, each business has an incentive to manufacture more than 2 million bottles of water in order to raise its profit. Because both businesses have no incentive to adjust their output volumes after they have found the Nash Equilibrium solution, it is the only stable conclusion.
