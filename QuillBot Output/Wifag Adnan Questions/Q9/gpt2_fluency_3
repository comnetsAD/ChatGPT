Given the opposing business's approach, the Nash Equilibrium of this game is a condition in which neither firm has an incentive to modify its strategy. The Nash Equilibrium in this scenario occurs when both businesses create 2 million bottles of water each, since neither company has an incentive to produce more than 2 million bottles. This is because if one corporation produces 2.5 million bottles and another produces 2 million bottles, the firm producing 2.5 million bottles will lose money while the other firm would gain money. Each firm's profit at the Nash Equilibrium is $6 million (total revenue of 12 million minus total cost of 6 million). The cooperative solution cannot be obtained in this scenario if the businesses only interact once. This is due to the businesses' inability to continue the collaboration for an extended length of time. In other words, if the businesses only meet once, there is no way for the firms to ensure that the other company would follow through on the cooperation arrangement in the future. As a result, each company will have an incentive to break the agreement and create 2.5 million bottles of water in order to maximize its own profit.
