Perrier cost: TC P = 2q P + 1. Evian cost: TC E = 2q E + 1. This game's Nash Equilibrium? Can corporations cooperate if they only interact once? Answer. This game's Nash Equilibrium occurs when one business produces the amount of water that optimizes their profit given the other firm's output. This Nash Equilibrium optimizes profits for both enterprises by producing 2.5 million bottles of water. When both businesses produce 2.5 million bottles of water, the market price is P = 10 - (2.5 + 2.5) = 5, and the total revenue of each company is TR = P * q = 5 * 2.5 = 13.75. TC = 2q + 1 = 2 * 2.5 + 1 = 6.25, and TR - TC = 13.75 - 6.25 = 7.5 is each firm's profit. Cooperative solutions are impossible if enterprises only interact once. In a one-shot game, there is no cartel agreement or penalty for cheating, so each corporation has an incentive to create more than 2 million bottles of water to boost its profit. Both businesses have no motivation to adjust production volumes after they achieve the Nash Equilibrium, making it the only stable conclusion.
