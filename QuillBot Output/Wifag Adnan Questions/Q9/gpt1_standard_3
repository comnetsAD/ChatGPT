This game's Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each business, where neither firm can increase its payout by altering its strategy while the other firm's approach stays constant. The Nash equilibrium in this situation is (q P = 2, q E = 2) because both businesses would decide to make 2 million water bottles. Since the other business's strategy is set, neither firm at this equilibrium may boost its profit by altering its approach. For instance, Perrier's profit would drop from 7 to 6.25 if its output were increased to 2.5 million bottles, whereas Evian's profit would not change. Evian's profit would drop from 7 to 6.25 if its output were increased to 2.5 million bottles, whereas Perrier's profit would not change. The cooperative solution (q P = 2.5, q E = 2.5) cannot be reached if the businesses only interact once. In the collaborative approach, both businesses would manufacture 2.5 million water bottles, maximizing their combined profit at 7.5 million. Firms can only reach the cooperative solution if they can commit to the approach, which they are unable to do since they cannot coordinate the activity. Since businesses are rational, they will decide on a strategy that maximizes their own profits. In this situation, as opposed to the cooperative solution, the Nash equilibrium is (q P = 2, q E = 2).
