The condition in which neither company has an incentive to modify its strategy as a result of the other company's plan is referred to as the Nash equilibrium for this game. In this scenario, the Nash equilibrium is reached when both companies create 2 million bottles of water each. This is because neither company has an incentive to produce more than 2 million bottles of water, hence the equilibrium is reached when both companies produce 2 million bottles of water. Because of this, if one company produces 2.5 million bottles while another company produces 2 million bottles, the company that produces 2.5 million bottles will see a decrease in profit while the other company will see an increase in profit. This is due to the fact that the firm that produces 2.5 million bottles will sell fewer bottles. When everything is in equilibrium, the profit for each company is six million dollars (total revenue of 12 million minus total cost of 6 million). If the companies only meet with one another once, it will not be possible to arrive at a joint solution to this problem. This is due to the fact that the companies will be unable to maintain their collaboration for an extended length of time. To put it another way, if the companies only deal with one another once, they won't have any means of knowing whether or not the other company would honor the terms of the collaboration agreement in the future. As a consequence of this, each company will have an incentive to violate the terms of the agreement by producing an additional 500,000 bottles of water in order to increase the amount of money it makes for itself.
