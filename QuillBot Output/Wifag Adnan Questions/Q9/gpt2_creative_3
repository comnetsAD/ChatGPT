In the Nash Equilibrium, both firms are content with their current strategies and have no need to shift gears in response to the actions of the other. Since neither company would benefit from producing more than 2 million bottles of water, the Nash Equilibrium occurs when both companies make that many. Reason being, if one company makes 2.5 million bottles and the other makes 2 million bottles, the first company's earnings will go down while the second company's would go up. Each company's profit is $6,000,000 in the Nash Equilibrium (total revenue of 12 million minus total cost of 6 million). When this occurs, a single interaction between the companies is insufficient to realize the cooperative solution. This is because long-term collaboration between the businesses is unrealistic. That is to say, if the companies only deal with one another once, they will have no means of knowing whether or not the other company would honor the future collaboration arrangement. Therefore, in order to maximize their profits, both companies will have an incentive to break the agreement and create more than 2.5 million bottles of water.
