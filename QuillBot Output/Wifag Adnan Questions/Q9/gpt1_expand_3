The Nash Equilibrium of this game is a set of strategies, one for each business, which are chosen in such a way that neither firm can increase its payout by altering its strategy while the other firm's approach is held constant. Since both companies would prefer to create 2 million bottles of water, the Nash Equilibrium is (q P = 2, q E = 2) in this scenario. At this point in time, neither company will be able to raise its profit by altering its business plan while the strategy of the other company stays unchanged. For instance, if Perrier were to raise its output to 2.5 million bottles, the company's profit would fall from seven to six and a quarter, whilst Evian's profit would stay the same. In a similar vein, if Evian were to raise its output to 2.5 million bottles, the company's profit would drop from seven to six and a quarter, whilst Perrier's profit would stay the same. If the businesses only engage with one another once, it will not be possible to reach the cooperative solution (q P = 2.5, q E = 2.5). In the scenario when the two companies work together, they will manufacture 2.5 million bottles of water, which would result in a maximum of 7.5 million dollars in combined profits. However, since businesses are unable to coordinate their actions, the only way for them to accomplish the cooperative solution is for them to be able to commit to the plan, which they cannot do. Due to the fact that the companies are rational, they will choose for the tactic that allows them to make the most money for themselves. In this scenario, the Nash Equilibrium is (q P = 2, q E = 2), which is distinct from the cooperative solution.
