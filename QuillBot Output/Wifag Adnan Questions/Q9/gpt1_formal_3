This game's Nash equilibrium is a set of strategies, one for each business, such that neither firm can increase its payout by altering its strategy while the other firm's approach stays unchanged. In this situation, the Nash Equilibrium is (q P = 2, q E = 2), since both enterprises chose to create 2 million water bottles. At this point, neither business can boost its profit by altering its strategy while the other firm's plan stays unchanged. For instance, if Perrier increased its output to 2.5 million bottles, its profit would reduce from seven to six and a quarter, but Evian's profit would stay same. Similarly, if Evian increased output to 2.5 million bottles, its profit would decline from $7 to $6.25, although Perrier's profit would stay the same. The cooperative solution (q P = 2.5, q E = 2.5) cannot be reached if companies only interact once. In the cooperative approach, both companies would generate 2.5 million bottles of water, yielding a combined profit of $7,500,000. Since enterprises cannot coordinate their actions, the only way they can accomplish the cooperative solution is by committing to the plan, which they cannot do. Since the businesses are rational, they will adopt the approach that maximizes their own profit, which differs from the cooperative solution (q P = 2, q E = 2).
