This game's Nash Equilibrium occurs when neither business has an incentive to modify its strategy given the other's. Since neither business has an incentive to manufacture more than 2 million bottles of water, the Nash Equilibrium equals 2 million bottles each. If one business produces 2.5 million bottles while the other produces 2 million, the firm producing 2.5 million bottles will lose profit while the other firm would gain profit. Each business makes 6 million at Nash Equilibrium (total revenue of 12 million minus total cost of 6 million). If businesses only engage once, the cooperative solution is impossible. Because the businesses cannot cooperate for long. Thus, if the businesses only interact once, they cannot guarantee that the other company will honor the collaboration agreement. Thus, each enterprise will have an incentive to break the agreement and make 2.5 million bottles of water to maximize profit.
