Cost for bottled water (per bottle), Number of bottles of water required (millions), Total Revenue, Marginal Revenue 10, 0, , \s9, 1, , \s8, 2, , \s7, 3, , \s6, 4, , \s5, 5, , \s4, 6, , \s3, 7, , \s2, 8, , \s1, 9, , As monopolists, the companies will choose their price and quantity according to the market demand timetable. To determine marginal revenue, we may deduct the revenue from each subsequent unit sold from the total revenue generated by the number already sold. Cost for bottled water (per bottle), Number of bottles of water required (millions), Total Revenue, Marginal Revenue 10, 0, 0, -\s9, 1, 9, 9\s8, 2, 16, 7\s7, 3, 21, 5\s6, 4, 24, 3\s5, 5, 25, 1\s4, 6, 24, -1\s3, 7, 21, -3\s2, 8, 16, -5\s1, 9, 9, -7 Given this demand curve, the monopoly price for water would be $10 per bottle, since this is the greatest price at which the businesses could still sell any amount. As this is the maximum number that enterprises may sell at the monopoly price, the monopoly production would be 1 million bottles. Each business would manufacture 0.5 million bottles of water at a profit of (0.5 million * $10) - $1 million = $4.5 million.
