Marginal revenue may be calculated by deducting the total revenue from the prior amount sold from the revenue generated by each new unit sold. Cost of water bottles (per bottle), Water bottle sales volume (millions), The Full Amount of Money Made, Profit Margins 10, 0, 0, -\s9, 1, 9, 9\s8, 2, 16, 7\s7, 3, 21, 5\s6, 4, 24, 3\s5, 5, 25, 1\s4, 6, 24, -1\s3, 7, 21, -3\s2, 8, 16, -5\s1, 9, 9, -7 Since this is the greatest price at which the businesses would still be able to sell any amount of water, we may conclude that $10 per bottle is the monopoly price given this demand schedule. Since one million bottles is the most that can be produced and sold at the monopoly price, it is the monopoly production. Each company would produce 0.5 million bottles of water and earn a profit of (0.5 million * $10) - ($1 million) = $4.5 million if all production were divided equally between the companies.
