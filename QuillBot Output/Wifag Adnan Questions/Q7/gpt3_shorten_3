We may deduct the income from each subsequent unit sold from the prior amount sold to determine marginal revenue. Bottled water cost (per bottle), Bottled water demand (millions), Sales, Revenue Margin 10, 0, 0, -\s9, 1, 9, 9\s8, 2, 16, 7\s7, 3, 21, 5\s6, 4, 24, 3\s5, 5, 25, 1\s4, 6, 24, -1\s3, 7, 21, -3\s2, 8, 16, -5\s1, 9, 9, -7 Given this demand schedule, the monopoly price would be $10 per bottle, the greatest price at which enterprises could sell any water. Since enterprises may sell 1 million bottles at the monopoly price, this is the monopoly production. Each business would create 0.5 million bottles of water and make $4.5 million by dividing the overall production equally.
