The following is the market demand timetable for bottled water in France: Bottled water costs how much? (per bottle), Bottle water quantity required (millions), Revenue as a whole, Revenue from Marginal Sources 10, 0, 0, -\s9, 1, 9, 9\s8, 2, 16, 7\s7, 3, 21, 5\s6, 4, 24, 3\s5, 5, 25, 1\s4, 6, 24, -1\s3, 7, 21, -3\s2, 8, 16, -5\s1, 9, 9, -7 The overall production generated is 45 million bottles, which is the sum of the amount of bottled water needed at each price level. Because the two companies share their entire production equally, each company will generate 22.5 million bottles. To determine the monopoly price, we must first determine the price level at which the amount demanded equals the total output generated by the enterprises. In this situation, the pricing level would be 5 Euros per bottle. To determine the monopoly production, we must first determine the amount requested at the monopoly price. That would be 5 million bottles in this scenario. To calculate each firm's profit, add the entire revenue at the monopoly price and deduct the total cost of production. The total manufacturing cost is the sum of the marginal and fixed costs, which is €2 per bottle + €1 million = €2 million.
