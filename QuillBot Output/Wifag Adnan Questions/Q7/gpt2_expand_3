The amount that would be requested at that price would equal the monopoly's production, which would be zero million bottles. Because of this pricing and production level, the companies would not be able to create any bottles, and they would not generate any profits as a result. To determine how much profit each company will make, the companies split the entire production created among themselves in an equal manner; however, because the companies do not manufacture any bottles, their profit will be zero.
