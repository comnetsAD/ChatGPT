To get the marginal revenue, deduct the revenue from each subsequent unit sold from the total revenue from the prior amount sold. Bottled water costs how much?

The monopoly production would be one million bottles, since this is the maximum number of bottles that the enterprises can sell at the monopoly price. Because the businesses equally share the entire output created, each company would produce 0.5 million bottles of water and earn (0.5 million * $10) - $1 million = $4.5 million.
