The timeline for bottled water market demand in France is as follows: What bottled water costs (per bottle), Demand for bottles of water (millions), overall revenue Marginal Sales 10, 0, 0, -\s9, 1, 9, 9\s8, 2, 16, 7\s7, 3, 21, 5\s6, 4, 24, 3\s5, 5, 25, 1\s4, 6, 24, -1\s3, 7, 21, -3\s2, 8, 16, -5\s1, 9, 9, -7 The overall production is calculated as the sum of the 45 million bottles of bottled water that were purchased at each price point. Each company will create 22.5 million bottles since the entire production generated by the two enterprises is divided equally. Finding the price at which the amount required equals the total output generated by the enterprises is necessary to determine the monopoly price. That would be the level of 5 euros per bottle in this instance. We must ascertain the amount requested at the monopoly price in order to determine the monopoly production. That would be 5 million bottles in this instance. Finding the entire revenue at the monopoly price and deducting the total cost of production will provide the profit for each business. The marginal cost plus the fixed cost, which is €2 per bottle plus €1 million, equals the total cost of manufacturing, or €2 million.
