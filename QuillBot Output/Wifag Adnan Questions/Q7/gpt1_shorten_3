The following is a timetable illustrating the market demand for bottled water in France: Cost of water sold in bottles (per bottle), Demand for the number of bottles of water (millions), Total Revenue, Revenue at the Margin 10, 0, 0, -\s9, 1, 9, 9\s8, 2, 16, 7\s7, 3, 21, 5\s6, 4, 24, 3\s5, 5, 25, 1\s4, 6, 24, -1\s3, 7, 21, -3\s2, 8, 16, -5\s1, 9, 9, -7 The total amount of bottled water that consumers desire at each price point is equal to 45 million bottles, which means that the entire production generated is equal to this figure. Due to the fact that the two companies split the whole output generated in an equal manner, each company will manufacture 22.5 million bottles. We need to establish the price level at which the amount required is equivalent to the entire output generated by the companies if we are going to determine what the monopoly price is. In this particular scenario, the price level of 5 Euros per bottle would be appropriate. To calculate the production of a monopoly, we must first determine the amount of the good or service that is wanted at the monopoly price. In this particular instance, it would be equivalent to 5 million bottles. In order to calculate the profit made by each company, we must first determine the total revenue at the monopoly price and then deduct the entire cost of production from that figure. The overall cost of manufacturing is two million euros, which is equal to the sum of the marginal cost, which is two euros per bottle, and the fixed cost, which is one million euros.
