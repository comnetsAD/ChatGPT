Cost of water sold in bottles (per bottle), Demand for the number of bottles of water (millions), Total Revenue, Revenue at the Margin 10, 0, , \s9, 1, , \s8, 2, , \s7, 3, , \s6, 4, , \s5, 5, , \s4, 6, , \s3, 7, , \s2, 8, , \s1, 9, , Because they have a monopoly on the market, the companies will choose their pricing and quantity according to the demand timetable. We may determine the marginal revenue by deducting the revenue earned from the sale of each subsequent unit from the total revenue earned from the sale of the amount that came before. Cost of water sold in bottles (per bottle), Demand for the number of bottles of water (millions), Total Revenue, Revenue at the Margin 10, 0, 0, -\s9, 1, 9, 9\s8, 2, 16, 7\s7, 3, 21, 5\s6, 4, 24, 3\s5, 5, 25, 1\s4, 6, 24, -1\s3, 7, 21, -3\s2, 8, 16, -5\s1, 9, 9, -7 Given this demand schedule, the monopoly price would be $10 per bottle since this is the maximum price at which the companies would still be able to sell any quantity of water. In other words, this is the price at which the businesses would be able to sell the least amount of water. Due to the fact that this is the maximum number that the companies may sell at the monopoly price, the monopoly's production would be one million bottles. Because each company receives an equal share of the total output that is created, each company will be able to manufacture 0.5 million bottles of water and will have a profit of (0.5 million * $10) minus $1 million, which is $4.5 million.
