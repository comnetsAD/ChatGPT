It would be difficult to build a machine translation system from Arabic to Finnish in two weeks with a $1000 budget and no parallel data. However, I would tackle this situation as follows: I would gather data using the Europarl and UN corpora, which are both publicly accessible and include a substantial quantity of text in both Arabic and Finnish. I would also incorporate any extra monolingual data I could uncover in both languages to increase the translation's quality. Data preprocessing: I would clean and preprocess the data to eliminate any extraneous information and verify that the data is in a training-ready condition. I would train using the Moses MT system, which is a popular open-source machine translation technology. Using the obtained data, I would train the algorithm and fine-tune the parameters to increase the translation quality. Assessment: To examine the performance of the translation system, I would utilize both automated and manual evaluation techniques. To compare the system's output to a reference translation, automatic assessment techniques like as BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE scores may be utilized. I would also utilize manual assessment, in which human evaluators examine the translation's quality and give comments. Budget utilization: I would utilize the $1000 budget to purchase hardware resources such as GPU and TPU to expedite the training process, as well as to cover the price of cloud services if necessary. It is crucial to highlight that developing a high-quality machine translation system is a tough endeavor that often requires far more resources and time than is available in this circumstance. The preceding strategy is just a proposal for how to proceed given the limited resources and time available, and the outcomes may not be as accurate as one may wish.
