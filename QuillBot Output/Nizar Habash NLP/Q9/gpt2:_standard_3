It would be difficult to build a machine translation system from Arabic to Finnish in two weeks with a budget of $1,000 and no parallel data. I would, however, tackle this issue in the following manner: Data gathering: Since the Europarl and UN corpora are open-access and include a significant quantity of Arabic and Finnish material, I would utilize them. To enhance the accuracy of the translation, I would also incorporate any extra monolingual information I could locate in both languages. Data cleaning and preprocessing: I would make sure the data is in a format that can be utilized for training and eliminate any extraneous information. Training: I would use the Moses MT system, an open-source machine translation tool that is widely utilized. To enhance the translation quality, I would train the system using the data gathered and adjust the settings. Assessment: To gauge the effectiveness of the translation system, I would use both automated and manual evaluation techniques. The output of the system may be compared to a reference translation using automatic assessment techniques including BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE scores. Additionally, I would use manual assessment, asking human reviewers to rate the accuracy of the translation and provide comments. Utilization of money: I would spend the $1000 budget on hardware resources like GPU and TPU to speed up the training process and, if necessary, to cover the price of cloud services. It is crucial to keep in mind that developing a high-quality machine translation system is a challenging endeavor that often calls for far more time and resources than what is available in this situation. The aforementioned strategy is only a recommendation for how to proceed given the limited time and resources available, and the outcomes may not be as precise as one would wish.
