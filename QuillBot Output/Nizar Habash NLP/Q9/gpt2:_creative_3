It would be difficult to create an Arabic-to-Finnish machine translation system in only two weeks, for $1,000, with no parallel data. The way I would tackle this issue, though, is as follows: When gathering information, I'd make use of the Europarl and UN corpus since they're publicly accessible and include a substantial volume of content in both Arabic and Finnish. To further enhance the quality of the translation, I would also incorporate any extra monolingual data I could locate in both languages. To prepare the data for training, I would first clean and preprocess it by removing duplicate records and any unnecessary information. In order to train, I would use the popular open-source MT system Moses. Using the data I gathered, I'd "train" the system to produce a more accurate translation and then adjust various parameters to achieve this goal. To evaluate the translation system's efficacy, I would use both automated and human assessment techniques. System output may be compared to a reference translation automatically using BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE scores, among others. Having human evaluators evaluate the translation and offer input is another method I'd utilize for manual assessment. Use of funds: If given a budget of $1,000, I would use it to acquire hardware resources like a graphics processing unit (GPU) or a tensor processing unit (TPU) to speed up the training process, as well as cover the price of any necessary cloud services. It's worth noting that developing a reliable machine translation system is a challenging endeavor that often needs more time and resources than are currently accessible. The preceding strategy is only a recommendation for moving forward within the constraints of the time and materials at hand, and the resulting accuracy may fall short of expectations.
