Building an Arabic-to-Finnish machine translation system in two weeks with a $1000 budget and no parallel data is difficult. I would address this issue as follows: Data collection: The Europarl and UN corpora are publicly accessible and include a lot of Arabic and Finnish material. I would also utilize whatever monolingual data I could discover in both languages to enhance the translation. Data preprocessing: I would delete unnecessary data and prepare the data for training. Training: I would utilize Moses MT, a popular open-source machine translation solution. To increase translation quality, I would train the system using acquired data and fine-tune settings. Evaluation: I would evaluate the translation system manually and automatically. BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE scores may compare system output to a reference translation. Human assessors would also evaluate the translation and give comments. Budget usage: I would utilize the $1000 budget to acquire GPUs and TPUs to expedite training and pay for cloud services if required. Building a high-quality machine translation system is tough and takes more resources and time than this case allows. The following strategy is a recommendation based on limited resources and time, and the outcomes may not be correct.
