Building an Arabic-to-Finnish machine translation system in two weeks with a $1000 budget and no parallel data would be difficult. Nonetheless, I would address this issue as follows: I would gather data using the Europarl and UN corpora since they are publicly accessible and include a substantial quantity of Arabic and Finnish language. I would also incorporate any extra monolingual data I could uncover in both languages to enhance the translation's quality. I would clean and preprocess the data to eliminate any extraneous information and verify that it is in a state that can be used for training. Training: I would use the widely-used open-source machine translation technology Moses MT. Using the obtained data, I would train the system and fine-tune the parameters to increase the quality of the translation. I would utilize both automated and human assessment approaches to measure the translation system's performance. BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE scores may be used to compare the output of the system to a reference translation. I would also use manual review by having human evaluators analyze and offer input on the quality of the translation. I would utilize the $1000 budget to purchase hardware resources like as GPUs and TPUs to expedite the training process and, if necessary, to pay for cloud service charges. It is essential to highlight that developing a high-quality machine translation system is a challenging endeavor that often demands far more resources and time than are available in this circumstance. The aforementioned strategy is only a proposal for how to continue with the limited resources and time available, and the outcomes may not be as precise as desired.
