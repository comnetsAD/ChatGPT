With little parallel data and little time, I would probably choose a transfer learning method to developing a machine translation system that can translate from Arabic to Finnish. One method to do this would be to use a little amount of parallel data that I can receive from the Europarl and UN corpus to fine-tune a pre-trained model such as the Moses MT system or one of the transformer models (e.g. T5, BERT). I would begin by cleaning and preparing the data, and then I would utilize the parallel data to adjust the already trained model. After that, I would utilize the money I had left to collect more parallel data from other sources, such online discussion boards or social media sites, in order to enhance the model's performance. I would use a range of metrics, including BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE to gauge the accuracy of the translations, to assess the model's performance. I would also carry out a human review by having translators who are native speakers of the two languages do so. In order to ensure that the translations are not only grammatically accurate but also make sense, I would also use the model to translate a collection of phrases and assess the model's capacity to maintain the meaning of the sentences. It's critical to remember that getting excellent performance with such constrained resources and a short time period will be difficult. However, in this situation, developing a machine translation system employing transfer learning and fine-tuning using learned models may still be successful.
