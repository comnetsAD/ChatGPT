It would be a difficult effort to construct a machine translation system from Arabic to Finnish in the time span of two weeks, with a budget of one thousand dollars, and with no parallel data. On the other hand, I would tackle this issue in the following manner: For the collecting of data, I recommend using Europarl and the UN corpus since they are both publicly accessible and include a significant volume of content written in Arabic and Finnish respectively. To further enhance the quality of the translation, I would make use of any extra monolingual data that I could locate in either of the target languages. I would clean and preprocess the data to get rid of any unnecessary information and to make sure that the data are in a state that can be utilized for training purposes. In terms of training, I would make use of the Moses MT system, which is an open-source machine translation system that is extensively used. I would train the system by feeding it the acquired data and then fine-tune the settings in order to get a higher level of accuracy in the translation. Assessment: If I were to evaluate the performance of the translation system, I would utilize a combination of automated and manual evaluation approaches. When comparing the output of the system to a reference translation, one may utilize automatic assessment techniques like BLEU, METEOR, and ROUGE scores, for example. In addition to this, I would employ manual assessment, which involves having human evaluators examine the level of quality of the translation and offer comments on their findings. Utilization of the Budget: If I had a budget of $1000, I would spend it on purchasing hardware resources like GPUs and TPUs to speed up the training process, as well as paying for the fees of cloud services if they were required. It is essential to keep in mind that developing a high-quality machine translation system is a challenging endeavor that often calls for a great deal more time and resources than are now at one's disposal in the presented circumstance. The preceding strategy is only a recommendation on how to continue with the limited resources and time that are now available, and the outcomes may not be as accurate as one may want for them to be.
