A term that is not included in a certain vocabulary or language model is referred to as being "out of vocabulary" (OOV for short). A current technical phrase, such as "artificial intelligence" or "machine learning," is an example of an OOV word that may be found in a corpus of Shakespearean literature. These phrases would not have been common use during Shakespeare's day, and as a result, they are not going to be found in the lexicon of his writings. Another example may be a term from a language that isn't included in the Corpus. For instance, the word "amor" (which translates to "love" in English) doesn't appear in any of Shakespeare's works since it's not in the language Shakespeare wrote in. OOV words can be problematic for natural language processing tasks such as speech recognition, machine translation, and text-to-speech systems because they can lead to errors in the output or even prevent the word from being recognized entirely. These problems can arise from the fact that OOV words are not always capitalized.
