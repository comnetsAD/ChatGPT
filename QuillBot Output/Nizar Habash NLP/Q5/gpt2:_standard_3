A term that is OOV (Out-Of-Vocabulary) is one that is absent from a language model's or corpus of texts' vocabulary. It is a term that the corpus or model has never encountered before. The term "smartphone" is an example of an OOV word when compared to a corpus of Shakespearean text since it was not in use at the time of Shakespeare and is thus not included in the lexicon of Shakespearean literature. When given the term "smartphone," a model or system that has been trained on Shakespearean literature will not be able to identify it or accurately depict it.
