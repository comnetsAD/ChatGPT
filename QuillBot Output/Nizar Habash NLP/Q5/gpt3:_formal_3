An Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) term is one that does not appear in a certain vocabulary or language model. A current technical phrase, such as "artificial intelligence" or "machine learning," would be an example of an OOV word versus a corpus of Shakespearean literature. These words would not have been in use during Shakespeare's time, and hence would not have been in his text's lexicon. Another example would be a term from a foreign language that isn't in the Corpus, such as "amor" (love in English) in Spanish that isn't in the Shakespearean text. OOV words may create problems in natural language processing activities such as voice recognition, machine translation, and text-to-speech systems by causing output mistakes or failing to identify the word entirely.
