An OOV (Out-Of-Vocabulary) term is one that does not appear in the vocabulary of a language model or text corpus. It is a term that the model or corpus has never heard or seen before. An example of an OOV term against a corpus of Shakespearean text would be "smartphone," which did not exist during Shakespeare's time and hence is not included in Shakespearean text's lexicon. If a model or system is trained on Shakespearean literature and then supplied with the term "smartphone," it will be unable to identify or accurately represent it.
