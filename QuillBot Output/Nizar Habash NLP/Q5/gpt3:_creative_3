A term that is not included in a certain dictionary or language model is said to be "out of vocabulary" (OOV). Words like "artificial intelligence" and "machine learning" are examples of contemporary technological terms that would be OOV in a Shakespearean text corpus. Shakespeare would not have used these phrases since they were not used during his day. Another possibility is a foreign word that isn't included in the Corpus, such as the Spanish term "amor" (love in English), which isn't included in Shakespeare's original text. Problems arise when OOV words are used in natural language processing activities like voice recognition, machine translation, and text-to-speech systems, where they may lead to inaccurate results or even the failure to identify the word entirely.
