Out-of-Vocabulary (OOV) words are words that are not included in the vocabulary of a language model or corpus of text. It is a term that neither the model nor the corpus recognizes or has ever encountered. The term "smartphone" is an example of an OOV word against a corpus of Shakespearean literature, since it did not exist during Shakespeare's time and is hence absent from the lexicon of Shakespearean writing. If a model or system were trained on Shakespearean literature and then supplied with the term "smartphone," it would be unable to identify or accurately represent the word.
