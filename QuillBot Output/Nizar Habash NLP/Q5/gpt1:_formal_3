OOV refers to terms that are not contained in the established vocabulary of a language model or corpus. These words are not recognized or comprehended by the model; they are also known as uncommon, unseen, or unknown words. Modern words or proper nouns that were not in use during Shakespeare's time, such as "smartphone" or "Google," are examples of OOV words in a corpus of Shakespearean texts. These terms would not be found in the corpus of Shakespearean texts, and the model would deem them OOV words.
