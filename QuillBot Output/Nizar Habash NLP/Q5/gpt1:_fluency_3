OOV stands for "Out Of Vocabulary," and it refers to terms that are not in a language model's or corpus's preset vocabulary. These words are classified as unusual words, invisible words, or unknown words since the model does not recognize or understand them. A contemporary term or proper noun that was not in use during Shakespeare's time, such as "smartphone" or "Google," would be an example of an OOV word against a corpus of Shakespearean literature. These terms would not be found in the Shakespearean text corpus' lexicon and would be classified as OOV by the model.
