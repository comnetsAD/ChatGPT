OOV, which stands for "Out of Vocabulary," refers to terms that are absent from a language model's or corpus's established vocabulary. These words, which are also known as uncommon, unseen, or unknown words, are not recognized or comprehended by the model. A contemporary term or proper noun that was not in use during Shakespeare's time, such as "smartphone" or "Google," would serve as an example of an OOV word when compared to a corpus of Shakespearean literature. These words would be regarded as OOV terms by the model since they are absent from the lexicon of the Shakespearean text corpus.
