A term that is not included in a specific vocabulary or linguistic model is referred to as an out-of-vocabulary (OOV) word. An OOV word would be a contemporary technical phrase like "artificial intelligence" or "machine learning" when compared to a corpus of Shakespearean literature. Shakespeare's period would not have seen the usage of these words, hence they would not be found in his text's lexicon. Another example would be a term from a foreign language that is absent from the Corpus, such as the Spanish word "amor," which is equivalent to the English word "love" in the Shakespearean text. OOV words may be problematic for NLP tasks like voice recognition, machine translation, and text-to-speech systems since they can result in output mistakes or result in the word not being recognized at all.
