Words not included in a language model's or a corpus of text's vocabulary are considered OOV (Out-Of-Vocabulary). It's a new term that neither the model nor the corpus have ever encountered before. Since "smartphone" did not exist during Shakespeare's time, it does not appear in the lexicon of Shakespearean text and is thus an example of an OOV term against a corpus of Shakespearean literature. The term "smartphone" would not be recognized or represented accurately by a model or system that had been trained on Shakespearean literature.
