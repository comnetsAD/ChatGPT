Out-Of-Vocabulary words are words that are not included in the vocabulary of a language model or a corpus of text. This kind of term is referred to as an OOV word. It is a term that neither the model nor the corpus are familiar with, since they have never encountered it before. The term "smartphone" is an example of an out-of-context word that may be found in a corpus of Shakespearean literature. Since this word did not exist during Shakespeare's time, it is not included in the lexicon of Shakespearean text. When given with the term "smartphone," a model or system that has been trained on Shakespearean literature would not be able to identify it or offer an appropriate depiction of it.
