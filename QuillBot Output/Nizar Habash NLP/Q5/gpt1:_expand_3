OOV is an abbreviation that stands for "Out Of Vocabulary," and it is used to refer to terms that are not included in the established vocabulary of a language model, also known as a corpus. These words are referred to as unusual words, unseen words, or unknown words since the model does not recognize or understand them. Other names for these words are unknown words and unseen words. A current term or a proper noun that was not in use during Shakespeare's time would be an example of an out-of-context word that may be found in a corpus of Shakespearean texts. Some examples of such words are "smartphone" and "Google." These terms would not be included in the vocabulary of the Shakespearean text corpus, hence the model would classify them as OOV words (Out of Vocabulary Words).
