Out-of-vocabulary (OOV) terms are those that cannot be found in a language model's (or a corpus's) established lexicon. Often referred to as "rare words," "unseen words," or "unknown words," these words are not included in the model's vocabulary. An OOV term against a Shakespearean text corpus would be a proper noun or a contemporary word that was not in common usage during Shakespeare's lifetime. The model would deem them to be OOV terms since they are not found in the Shakespearean text corpus.
