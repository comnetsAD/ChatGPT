Park Pirook d. park pimark - template modification e. park daparkez - prefixation The process of creating the plural form by adding a suffix to the single form is known as suffixation. In this particular example, the suffix '-at' is added to the singular form of the word 'park' in order to get the plural form 'parkat.' The process of creating the plural form by repeating or partly repeating the single form is referred to as reduplication. In this particular illustration, the initial two letters of the singular form of the word 'park' are repeated to generate the plural form 'papark.' The formation of the plural form known as infixation involves adding a segment into the formation of the single form. In this particular illustration, the suffix 'irook' is superimposed above the singular form of the word 'park' in order to get the plural form 'pirook.' The structure of the single form is altered so that it may be converted into its corresponding plural form via template modification. In order to obtain the plural form, the single form "park" is transformed into the form "pimark" in this example. Adding a prefix to the single form results in the formation of the plural form, which is known as prefixation. In this particular example, the formation of the plural form "daparkez" is accomplished by appending the prefix "da" to the singular form "park."
