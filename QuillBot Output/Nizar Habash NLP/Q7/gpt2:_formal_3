To calculate the BLEU-2 (unigram+bigram) score for the system output ("paid it, swept it, forgot it. "), we must first calculate the accuracy scores for each n-gram (unigram and bigram) in the system output. 3/4 precision for unigrams (3 out of the 4 unigrams in the system output also appear in at least one of the references) 1/3 accuracy for bigrams (2 out of the 3 bigrams in the system output also appear in at least one of the references) Next, we determine the length penalty, which is computed as follows: Length Penalty Equals e (1 - (ref length / sys length)) In this instance, the shortest reference length is 18 and the output length of the system is 14, hence the length penalty is e (1 - (18 / 14)) = 0.935 Finally, the BLEU score is computed using the following formula: The BLEU formula is (precision unigram * precision bigram)0.5 * length penalty. BLEU-2 = (3/4 * 2/3)^0.5 * 0.935 = 0.564 Consequently, the BLEU-2 score for the system output in comparison to the three references is 0.564.
