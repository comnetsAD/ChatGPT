To calculate the BLEU-2 score, we must first calculate the unigram and bigram precision for the system output ("paid it, swept it, forgot it") against each of the three references. Ref 1's unigram precision is 2/4 = 0.5. Ref 1 bigram precision: 1/3 = 0.33 Ref 2's unigram precision is 2/4 = 0.5. Ref 2 bigram precision: 1/3 = 0.33 Ref 3's unigram precision is 2/4 = 0.5. Ref 3 bigram precision: 1/3 = 0.33 The harmonic mean of these precisions multiplied by the length penalty yields the final BLEU-2 score. The length penalty is calculated by dividing the length of the system output by the shortest reference length (in this example, Ref 1: 4). (in this case, 3). 4/3 penalty for length BLEU-2 = ((0.5 * 0.33)(1/2)) * BLEU-2 length penalty = 0.41 As a result, the BLEU-2 score for the system output compared to the three references is 0.41.
