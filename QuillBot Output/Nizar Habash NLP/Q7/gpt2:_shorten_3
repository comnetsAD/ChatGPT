Before we can compute the BLEU-2 (unigram+bigram) score for the system output ("paid it, swept it, forgot it. "), we need to first calculate the precision scores for each n-gram (unigram and bigram) that is included in the system output. This will allow us to compare the system output to the set of three references. 3/4 is the precision for unigrams (3 out of the 4 unigrams in the system output also appear in at least one of the references) 2/3 is the precision for bigrams (2 out of the 3 bigrams in the system output also appear in at least one of the references) The next step is to determine the length penalty, which is determined by the following formula: The length penalty is equal to e. (1 - (ref length / sys length)) In this particular instance, the system output length is 14, and the shortest reference length available is 18, hence the length penalty is expressed as e. (1 - (18 / 14)) = 0.935 In the end, we use the following algorithm to get the BLEU score: BLEU is calculated as (precision unigram * precision bigram) minus 0.5 times the length penalty. BLEU-2 = (3/4 * 2/3)^0.5 * 0.935 = 0.564 Therefore, the value of 0.564 for the BLEU-2 score represents the system output in comparison to the set of three references.
