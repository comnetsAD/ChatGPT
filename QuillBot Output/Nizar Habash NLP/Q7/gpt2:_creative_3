The accuracy scores for each n-gram (unigram and bigram) in the system output must be calculated before we can compute the BLEU-2 (unigram+bigram) score for the output ("paid it, swept it, forgot it.") against the set of three references. 3/4 accuracy in unigram measurements (3 out of the 4 unigrams in the system output also appear in at least one of the references) Bigram accuracy: 2/3 (2 out of the 3 bigrams in the system output also appear in at least one of the references) After that, we determine the cost of more length by using the formula: Penalty when Length = e (one minus (ref length/system length)) Considering that the shortest reference length is 18, and the output length from the system is 14, we get a length penalty of e. (1 - (18 / 14)) = 0.935 When everything is said and done, the BLEU score is arrived at as follows: the BLEU formula is: BLEU = 0.5 * (precision unigram * precision bigram) * length penalty BLEU-2 = (3/4 * 2/3)^0.5 * 0.935 = 0.564 Thus, the output of the system was given a BLEU-2 score of 0.564 when compared to the three standards.
