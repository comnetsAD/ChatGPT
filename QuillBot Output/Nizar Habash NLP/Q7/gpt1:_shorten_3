Before we can calculate the BLEU-2 score, we need to first determine the unigram and bigram accuracy of the system output ("paid it, swept it, forgot it") with respect to each of the three references. Accuracy of the Unigram for Reference 1: 2/4 = 0.5 Accuracy of the bigram for reference 1: 1/3 = 0.33 Accuracy of the Unigram for Reference 2: 2/4 = 0.5 Accuracy of the bigram for reference 2: 1/3 = 0.33 Accuracy of the Unigram for Reference 3: 2/4 = 0.5 Accuracy of the bigram for reference 3: 13 = 0.33 When calculating the final BLEU-2 score, the harmonic mean of these precisions is taken, and that number is then multiplied by the length penalty. The length penalty is calculated by taking the length of the reference with the shortest length (in this example, the length of Ref 1: 4) and dividing it by the length of the system output. This gives the length penalty (in this case, 3). The length penalty is equal to 4/3. BLEU-2 equals 0.41 when multiplied by the length penalty of ((0.5 * 0.33)(1/2)). Therefore, the value of the BLEU-2 score for the system output in comparison to the three references is 0.41.
