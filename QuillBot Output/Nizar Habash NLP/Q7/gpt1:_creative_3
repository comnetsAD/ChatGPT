The unigram and bigram accuracy of the system output ("paid it, swept it, forgot it") against each of the three references must be calculated before the BLEU-2 score can be calculated. For Ref. 1, the accuracy of a unigram is 2/4 = 0.5 For the first reference, a bigram of 1/3 is 0.33 For Ref. 2, the accuracy of a unigram is 2/4 = 0.5 1/3 = 0.33 is the bigram accuracy for Ref 2. For the third reference, the unigram accuracy is 2/4 = 0.5. 1/3 = 0.33 is the bigram accuracy for the third reference. Using the harmonic mean of these accuracies and the length penalty, a final BLEU-2 score may be calculated. Length penalties are calculated by dividing the system output by the shortest reference length (in this example, Ref 1: 4). (in this case, 3). Cost for being too long: 4/3 The formula for BLEU-2 is BLEU-2 = ((0.5 * 0.33)(1/2)) * length penalty. Therefore, comparing the system's output to the three standards yields a BLEU-2 score of 0.41.
