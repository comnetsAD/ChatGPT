To calculate the BLEU-2 (unigram+bigram) score for the system output ("paid it, swept it, forgot it.") against the set of three references, we must first compute the accuracy scores for each n-gram (unigram and bigram) in the system output. Unigram precision: 3/4 (3 out of the 4 unigrams in the system output also appear in at least one of the references) Bigram precision: 2/3 (2 out of the 3 bigrams in the system output also appear in at least one of the references) Following that, we compute the length penalty, which is determined as follows: Penalty when Length = e (1 minus (ref length / sys length)) The shortest reference length in this example is 18, while the system output length is 14, therefore the length penalty is e. (1 - (18 / 14)) = 0.935 Finally, we compute the BLEU score using the following formula: (precision unigram * precision bigram)0.5 * length penalty = BLEU BLEU-2 = (3/4 * 2/3)^0.5 * 0.935 = 0.564 As a result, the BLEU-2 score for the system output compared to the set of three references is 0.564.
