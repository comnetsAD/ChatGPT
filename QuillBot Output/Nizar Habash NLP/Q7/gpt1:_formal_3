To get the BLEU-2 score, we must first determine the unigram and bigram accuracy of the system output ("paid it, swept it, forgot it") against each of the three references. Unigram accuracy for Reference 1: 2/4 = 0.5 1/3 = 0.33; Bigram precision for Ref. 1 Unigram accuracy for Reference 2: 2/4 = 0.5 1/3 = 0.33; Bigram precision for Ref. 2: 1/3 Unigram accuracy for Reference 3: 2/4 = 0.5 1/3 = 0.33; Bigram precision for Ref. 3 To get the final BLEU-2 score, the harmonic mean of these precisions is multiplied by the length penalty. The length penalty is derived by dividing the system output length by the shortest reference length (in this example, the length of Ref 1: 4). (in this case, 3). penalty for length = 4/3 BLEU-2 = (((0.5 * 0.33)(1/2)) * length penalty The BLEU-2 score for the system output compared to the three references is thus 0.41.
