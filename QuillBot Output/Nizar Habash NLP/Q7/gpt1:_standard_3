The unigram and bigram precision for the system output ("paid it, swept it, forgot it") against each of the three references must first be calculated in order to get the BLEU-2 score. Unigram accuracy for Reference 1 is 2/4 = 0.5. Ref 1's bigram precision is 1/3 = 0.33. Unigram accuracy for Reference 2 is 2/4 = 0.5. Ref 2's bigram precision is 1/3 = 0.33. Unigram accuracy for Reference 3 is 2/4 = 0.5. Ref 3's bigram accuracy is 1/3 = 0.33. The harmonic mean of these precisions, compounded by the length penalty, results in the final BLEU-2 score. By dividing the shortest reference length (in this example, the length of Ref 1: 4) by the length of the system output, the length penalty is calculated (in this case, 3). penalty for length = 4/3 ((0.5 * 0.33)(1/2)) * length penalty makes BLEU-2 equal to 0.41. Therefore, the system output's BLEU-2 score against the three references is 0.41.
