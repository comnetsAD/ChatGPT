To design a cross-lingual question-answering system for Arabic-to-Finnish on a tight budget and in a short amount of time, I would likely use the machine translation model I developed for the prior mission as a starting point. I would utilize the Arabic query and convert it into Finnish using the machine translation methodology. Then, I would utilize Lextrista's English-only IR system to search the Finnish papers, yielding a collection of pertinent documents. To extract crucial information from the papers in the absence of a summary tool, I would use a basic rule-based summation method. This may use approaches such as extracting the initial few phrases of a document or finding and extracting sentences containing certain keywords. I would utilize measures like as accuracy, recall, and F1-score to analyze the system's capacity to retrieve relevant documents in order to evaluate its performance. The relevancy of the texts and the quality of the summaries would also be assessed by native speakers of both languages. Noting that reaching good performance with such a short timeline and minimal resources would be difficult is essential. In this scenario, developing a cross-lingual question-answering system utilizing the machine translation model I developed in the prior mission and a basic rule-based summarization method may still be a viable strategy.
