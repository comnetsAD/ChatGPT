Using Lextrista's English-only IR system, I would take the following measures to construct a cross-lingual question-answering system for Arabic to Finnish: Use the automated Arabic-to-English translator I built for the last mission to do the translation. This will enable me to do my research using Lextrista's IR system, which is now only available in English. Lextrista's IR system is limited to English, but you may still use it to get useful materials in Finnish. Use the automated translation system I developed in the last task to convert the necessary Finnish papers into English. Use a text summarizing program to glean the most relevant details from the translated papers. Pre-trained models like T5, BERT, and GPT-3 may be used for this purpose. Do a machine translation from English to Finnish using the technique I developed in the last challenge. Finally, I'd utilize the instrument to assess the system's performance by comparing human judgment to objective measures of summary quality such as ROUGE and BLEU. A machine translation system combined with a text summary tool to produce the summaries may not be the greatest answer, and the performance may not be as good as using a summation tool designed specifically for Finnish, but it may be the best option when time and resources are limited.
