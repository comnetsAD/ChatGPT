I would probably start by using the machine translation model I created for the last mission as a starting point in the procedure if I were to design a cross-lingual question-answering system for Arabic to Finnish with a constrained budget and schedule. I would utilize the Arabic query and convert it into Finnish using a machine translation model. The Finnish papers would then be searched using Lextrista's English-only IR system, returning a list of pertinent documents. I would utilize a simple rule-based summarizing strategy to extract the important information from the texts as I don't have a summation tool. This could include methods like removing the initial few phrases from a text or locating and removing sentences that contain certain keywords. I would examine the system's capacity to retrieve pertinent documents using measures like accuracy, recall, and F1-score to see how well it performed. I would also do a human review by asking native speakers of both languages to assess the accuracy and usefulness of the texts. It's critical to remember that getting excellent performance with such constrained resources and a short time period will be difficult. However, in this situation, utilizing the machine translation model I created for the prior mission and a simple rule-based summary method may still be a successful strategy for developing a cross-lingual question-answering system.
