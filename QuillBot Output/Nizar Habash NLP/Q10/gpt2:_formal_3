To create an Arabic-to-Finnish cross-lingual question-answering system utilizing Lextrista's English-only IR technology, I would do the following steps: Using the machine translation system I created for the last challenge, translate the Arabic question into English. This will enable me to use the English-only IR system of Lextrista to search for pertinent documents. Retrieve relevant Finnish documents using the English-only IR system of Lextrista. Using the machine translation system I created for the last job, translate the required documents from Finnish to English. Using a tool for text summary, extract the most vital information from translated materials. Using pre-trained models like as T5, BERT, and GPT-3, this may be accomplished. Using the machine translation system I created for the last challenge, translate the summary from English to Finnish. In addition to human review, I would utilize the tool to evaluate the system by analyzing the quality of the produced summaries using metrics such as ROUGE and BLEU. It is important to note that using a machine translation system and a text summarization tool to generate summaries may not be the best solution, and the performance may not be as good as using a summarization tool designed specifically for Finnish, but with limited resources and time, this approach could still be effective.
