Using the machine translation model I developed for the last mission would be a good starting point if I were tasked with creating a cross-lingual question-answering system for Arabic to Finnish on a tight schedule and with a little budget. So as to translate the Arabic question into Finnish, I may utilize a machine translation model. The Finnish papers would then be searched using Lextrista's English-only IR system, yielding a list of hits. Instead of using a dedicated summary tool, I want to use a simple rule-based summation approach to glean relevant details from the provided papers. A few examples of such methods include removing the document's introduction and locating and removing phrases that contain desired keywords. I would use measures like accuracy, recall, and F1-score to assess the system's capacity to retrieve relevant documents and determine how well it performed. To supplement this automated process, I would have native speakers of both languages assess the texts for their usefulness and the quality of any summary they could have created. It's worth noting that due to the short timeline and limited resources, obtaining good performance will be difficult. A cross-lingual question-answering system may still be created with the help of the machine translation model I used in the last mission and a simple rule-based summarization strategy.
