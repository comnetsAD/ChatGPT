The following are the steps that I would take in order to develop a cross-lingual question-and-answer system for Arabic-to-Finnish utilizing Lextrista's English-only IR system: Perform an Arabic to English translation of the question with the method for automatic translation that I developed in the last task. This will enable me to search for pertinent papers using Lextrista's IR system, which is only available in English. Using Lextrista's IR system, which only supports English, get important documents written in Finnish. Make use of the automated translation system that I developed for the prior mission to complete the translation of the necessary documents from Finnish to English. The papers that were translated should have a text summarizing technique applied to them so that the most significant information can be extracted. Utilizing pre-trained models like as T5, BERT, and GPT-3 is one way to accomplish this goal. Make use of the automated translation system that I developed for the prior mission to complete the translation of the summary from English to Finnish. In the end, I would utilize the tool to evaluate the system by assessing the quality of the summaries that were produced via the use of metrics such as ROUGE and BLEU, in addition to doing human review. Using a machine translation system and a text summarization tool to generate the summaries might not be the best solution, and the performance might not be as good as using a specific summarization tool for Finnish, but with limited resources and time, this approach could still be effective. It is important to note that using a machine translation system and a text summarization tool to generate the summaries might not be the best solution.
