I would leverage the machine translation model I established in the last assignment to construct an Arabic-to-Finnish cross-lingual question-answering system on a tight budget and timeline. The machine translation model would translate the Arabic query into Finnish. Lextrista's English-only IR system would search Finnish materials and offer appropriate results. I would use a basic rule-based summarizing method to extract important information from papers without a tool. This might include extracting the initial few phrases of a document or finding and extracting keywords. I'd utilize precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the system's document retrieval performance. I'd also have native speakers of both languages assess the papers' relevancy and summary. With such a short timeframe and minimal resources, excellent performance will be difficult. I can still develop a cross-lingual question-answering system utilizing the machine translation model I established in the last mission and a basic rule-based summarization strategy.
