To construct a cross-lingual question-answering system for Arabic-to-Finnish with a restricted budget and timeline, I would most likely start with the machine translation model I established in the prior mission. I would utilize the Arabic query and convert it into Finnish using the machine translation methodology. Then I'd search the Finnish papers using Lextrista's English-only IR engine, which would yield a list of pertinent documents. Because I lack a summary tool, I would extract important information from the papers using a basic rule-based summation approach. Techniques such as extracting the opening few phrases of a document or recognizing and extracting sentences containing certain keywords might be included. To assess the system's performance, I would utilize measures like as accuracy, recall, and F1-score to assess the system's ability to retrieve relevant documents. I would also use human review to assess the relevancy of the materials and the quality of the summaries, which I would accomplish by having native speakers of both languages evaluate them. It is critical to recognize that reaching excellent performance with such a short time period and minimal resources will be difficult. However, in this situation, utilizing the machine translation model I developed in the previous mission and a basic rule-based summarization strategy may be a successful way to developing a cross-lingual question-answering system.
