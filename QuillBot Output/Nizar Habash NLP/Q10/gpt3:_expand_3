If I were tasked with developing a cross-lingual question-answering system for Arabic-to-Finnish in a short amount of time and with a constrained budget, the first thing I would do would probably be to make use of the machine translation model that I developed for the prior mission as a starting point for the process. In order to translate the Arabic question into Finnish, I would first run it through the machine translation model and then utilize the result. After that, I would search for the appropriate papers in the Finnish documents using the IR system that is only available in English on Lextrista's website. This would result in the return of a list of relevant documents. I do not have a tool that can summarize, therefore in order to extract the most important information from the papers, I will use a simple method that is based on rules. Techniques such as extracting the first few sentences of a document or locating sentences that include specified keywords and then extracting those phrases might fall under this category. I would utilize measures like as precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the system's capacity to retrieve relevant documents in order to evaluate the performance of the system. These metrics quantify the system's accuracy. In addition, I would do human review by having native speakers of both languages assess the quality of the summaries and the relevancy of the content. It is essential to emphasize the fact that reaching good performance with such a short amount of time and a restricted amount of resources would be difficult. In spite of this, constructing a cross-lingual question-answering system by using the machine translation model I developed for the last mission in conjunction with a simple rule-based mechanism for summarizing has the potential to be an efficient strategy.
