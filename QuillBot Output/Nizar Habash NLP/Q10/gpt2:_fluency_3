I would use Lextrista's English-only IR system to develop a cross-lingual question-answering system for Arabic-to-Finnish: Use the machine translation system I established in the last task to translate the question from Arabic to English. This will enable me to search for relevant papers using Lextrista's English-only IR system. Using Lextrista's English-only IR system, locate relevant documents in Finnish. Use the machine translation system I established in the last task to translate the required documents from Finnish to English. Using a text summarizing tool, extract the most significant information from the translated papers. This is possible by using pre-trained models such as T5, BERT, and GPT-3. Use the machine translation system I established in the last task to translate the summary from English to Finnish. Finally, I would utilize the tool to assess the system by analyzing the quality of the produced summaries using metrics like ROUGE and BLEU, as well as by doing human review. It is important to note that using a machine translation system and a text summarization tool to generate the summaries may not be the best solution, and the performance may not be as good as using a Finnish-specific summarization tool, but with limited resources and time, this approach may still be effective.
