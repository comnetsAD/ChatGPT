I would take these steps to develop a cross-lingual Arabic-to-Finnish question-answering system utilizing Lextrista's English-only IR framework: Translate the question from Arabic to English using my machine translation engine. Lextrista's English-only IR system lets me find relevant materials. Lextrista's English-only IR system retrieves Finnish documents. Translate appropriate Finnish papers to English using my machine translation technique from the prior task. Text summary may extract the most significant information from translated materials. T5, BERT, and GPT-3 pre-trained models allow this. Translate the summary into Finnish using my machine translation method. Finally, I would utilize the tool to assess the system's summary using ROUGE and BLEU metrics and human review. Note that utilizing a machine translation system and a text summarizing tool to create summaries may not be the ideal answer and may not perform as well as using a Finnish-specific summary technology, but with limited resources and time, this technique may work.
