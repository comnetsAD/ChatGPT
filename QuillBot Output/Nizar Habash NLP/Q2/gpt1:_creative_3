There are two possible interpretations of the line "The chicken is too hot to eat." The initial interpretation is that the chicken is too hot to consume right away since it has been roasted to a high temperature. The second interpretation is that there is too much heat or spice on the chicken, making it unpleasant to consume. Rephrasing the line as "The chicken is too hot temperature-wise to consume" clarifies the meaning. We can't eat the chicken because it's too hot. This ensures that there is no room for interpretation or interpretational error.
