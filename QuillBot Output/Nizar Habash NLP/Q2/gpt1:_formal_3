The interpretation of the phrase "The chicken is too hot to eat" depends on the intended meaning of "hot." The chicken has been cooked and is currently at a high temperature, making it unsuitable for immediate consumption. The second interpretation is that the chicken has too much spice or heat added and is thus unsuitable for consumption. To eliminate ambiguity, the statement might be worded as follows: "The chicken is too hot to consume from a temperature standpoint." The chicken is too hot for consumption. Thus, the meaning is unambiguous and there is no ambiguity.
