Depending on how "hot" is used, the statement "The chicken is too hot to eat" may be interpreted in one of two ways. The first measurement indicates that the chicken has been cooked and has reached a temperature that makes it unsafe to consume right away. The second interpretation is that the chicken has been too spiced or heated and is too hot to consume. The phrase may be changed to read, "The chicken is too hot temperature-wise to consume," to eliminate the ambiguity. Too hot to consume the chicken. In this manner, there is no ambiguity and the message is apparent.
