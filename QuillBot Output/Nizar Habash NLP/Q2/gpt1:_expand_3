The phrase "The chicken is too hot to eat," for example, may be interpreted in two distinct ways, depending on how the word "hot" is meant to be used. According to the first interpretation, the chicken has been cooked and is currently at a high temperature, which makes it unsafe to consume right away since it is too hot. The second interpretation is that the chicken has been seasoned with an excessive amount of spice or heat, and as a result, it is inedible. The meaning of the line may be clarified by rephrasing it as follows: "The chicken is unsafe to consume due to its high temperature." It's going to burn your mouth to consume that chicken. In this manner, the message is unmistakable, and there is no room for interpretation.
