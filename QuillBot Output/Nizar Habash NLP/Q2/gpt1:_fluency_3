Depending on the intended meaning of "hot," the line "The chicken is too hot to eat." might have two alternative interpretations. The first reading indicates that the chicken has been cooked and has reached a high temperature, making it unsafe to consume right away. The second result indicates that the chicken has been seasoned with too much spice or heat and is too hot to consume. To resolve the ambiguity, rewrite the statement as follows: "The chicken is too hot to consume." "The chicken is much too hot to consume." There is no ambiguity and the message is plain.
