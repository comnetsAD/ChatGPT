The term "OCR" refers to a set of technologies that allow computers to read and extract text from non-native formats, such as digital photographs, scanned documents, and PDF files. Characters in a picture of text are identified and translated into text that can be read by a computer. An image of a scanned document containing text, such a scanned PDF of a book page, is an example of OCR input. Using optical character recognition technology, the picture would be analyzed to extract the textual information and then converted into a machine-readable format. Text that has been extracted from an image, such as a plaintext file containing the text of the scanned document, is an example of OCR output. Once the text has been extracted, it may be used in other applications. Just picture a scanned copy of a book page with the words "The swift brown fox leaps over the slow hound" The picture would be processed by optical character recognition software, which would then extract the text. You'd get simple text like "The swift brown fox leaps over the slow hound." OCR has several potential uses, including the automation of data input, the digitization of books and papers, and the searchability of text inside digital pictures and scanned documents.
