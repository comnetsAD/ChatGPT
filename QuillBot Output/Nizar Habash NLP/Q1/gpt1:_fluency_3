OCR is a technique that allows a computer to detect text inside an image or scanned document and turn it into editable and searchable text. OCR software examines a text picture and compares the characters' forms, patterns, and other attributes to a preset set of characters. The program can identify the most probable text represented by the picture based on this analysis. An image of a scanned document containing text, such as a scanned image of a page from a book or a scanned image of a printed document, is an example of OCR input. A plain text file containing the text from the scanned document is an example of OCR output. If the input is a picture of a scanned page from a book, for example, the output is a plain text file containing the content of that page, which may then be altered or searched using a text editor or word processor.
