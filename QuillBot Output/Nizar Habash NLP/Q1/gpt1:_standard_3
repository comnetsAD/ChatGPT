A computer can detect text in an image or scanned document using optical character recognition (OCR), which turns the text into editable and searchable text. OCR software examines a text picture and compares the characters' forms, patterns, and other attributes to a preset set of characters. The program can identify the most probable text represented by the picture based on this research. A scanned image of a text-containing document, such as a page from a book or a printed document, would serve as an example of OCR input. A plain text file containing the text from the scanned document would be an example of OCR output. A plain text file containing the text of the input page, for instance, would be the output if the input were an image of a scanned page from a book. This file could then be modified or searched in a text editor or word processor.
