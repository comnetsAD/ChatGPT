OCR is a technique that allows computers to identify and extract text from scanned documents, digital photos, and PDF files. The technique includes evaluating a picture of text, identifying the characters within it, and transforming the image into text that is machine-readable. An image of a scanned document containing text, such as a scanned PDF of a book page, is an example of OCR input. The OCR program would analyze the picture, identify the characters inside it, and turn the image into text that can be read by a computer. Text retrieved from an image, such as a plaintext file containing the text of a scanned document, is an example of OCR output. This content is then editable, searchable, and processable by other software applications. Imagine a picture of a scanned document of a page from a book with the sentence "The swift brown fox leaps over the slothful hound." The OCR program would analyze the picture, identify the characters, and turn the image into text that could be read by a computer. The output would be in the form of simple text: "The swift brown fox leaps over the slothful hound." OCR may be used for a number of purposes, including digitizing books and papers, automating data input, and making digital pictures and scanned documents searchable.
