OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is a computer technique that recognizes and extracts text from digital photos, scanned documents, and PDF files. The procedure entails studying a text picture, identifying the letters included within it, and transforming the image into machine-readable text. An image of a scanned document containing text, such as a scanned PDF of a page from a book, is an example of OCR input. The picture would be analyzed using OCR software, which would recognize the characters inside it and transform the image into machine-readable text. The text retrieved from the picture, such as a plaintext file containing the text of the scanned document, is an example of OCR output. Other software applications may then edit, search, or process this text. Consider a picture of a scanned document of a page from a book with the following text: "The swift brown fox leaps over the slow hound." The picture would be analyzed using OCR software, which would detect the characters and turn the image into machine-readable text. "The swift brown fox leaps over the slow dog," for example, would be the outcome. OCR has a wide range of uses, including digitizing books and papers, automating data input, and making text searchable in digital pictures and scanned documents.
