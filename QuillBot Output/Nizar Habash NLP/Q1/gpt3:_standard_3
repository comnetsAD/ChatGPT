Computers can detect and extract text from digital photos, scanned documents, and PDF files using optical character recognition (OCR), a technology. An picture of text is analyzed, its characters are identified, and the image is then transformed into machine-readable text. An picture of a text-containing scanned document, such as a scanned PDF of a book page, would serve as an example of OCR input. The picture would be examined by the OCR software, which would identify the characters inside and turn the image into machine-readable text. The text that is extracted from the picture, such as a plaintext file containing the content of the scanned document, would be an example of OCR output. Other software applications may then edit, search, or modify this content. For illustration, visualize a scanned picture of a book page with the sentence "The swift brown fox leaps over the slow hound" on it. The picture would be examined by the OCR software, which would identify the characters and turn the image into machine-readable text. The result would be plain text with the following content: "The swift brown fox leaps over the sluggish dog." OCR is helpful for many different tasks, including digitizing books and papers, automating data input, and enabling text search in digital pictures and scanned documents.
