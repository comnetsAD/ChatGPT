OCR lets computers read text from digital photos, scanned documents, and PDF files. An picture of text is analyzed, characters are recognized, and machine-readable text is created. OCR input might be a scanned PDF of a book page. OCR software would recognize characters in the picture and translate them into machine-readable text. OCR output might be a plaintext file with the scanned document's text. Other applications can edit, search, or process this content. "The swift brown fox leaps over the slow hound" is a scanned book page. OCR software analyzes the picture, recognizes characters, and converts it into machine-readable text. "The swift brown fox leaps over the slow dog" would be the result. OCR can digitize books and papers, automate data input, and search digital pictures and scanned documents.
