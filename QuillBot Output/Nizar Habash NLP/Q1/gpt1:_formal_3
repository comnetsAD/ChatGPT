OCR is a technique that allows a computer to identify text inside an image or scanned document and turn it into editable and searchable text. The OCR program examines a picture of text and compares the forms, patterns, and other features of the characters to a preset set of characters. Based on this research, the program can infer the most probable text that the picture represents. An image of a scanned document containing text, such as a scanned image of a book page or a scanned image of a printed document, is an example of OCR input. An example of OCR output is a plain text file containing the scanned document's text. For instance, if the input is a picture of a scanned book page, the output would be a plain text file containing the page's content, which may then be altered or searched using a text editor or word processor.
