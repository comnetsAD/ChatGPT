With optical character recognition (OCR), a computer is able to read text from a scanned document or picture and turn it into fully editable and searchable text. An picture of text is sent into an OCR program, which then compares the forms, patterns, and other features of the characters in the image to a preset set of characters. The program uses this information to infer which text is most likely being represented by the picture. An image of a scanned document containing text, such a page from a book or a scanned copy of a printed document, is an example of OCR input. A plain text file containing the scanned document's text is an example of OCR output. The result of such a procedure would be a plain text file containing the text of a scanned book page, which could then be altered or searched in a word processor or text editor.
