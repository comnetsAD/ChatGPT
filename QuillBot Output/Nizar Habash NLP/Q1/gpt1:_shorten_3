Optical Character Recognition, often known as OCR, is a kind of technology that allows a computer to detect text contained inside an image or scanned document and then transform that data into text that can be edited and searched. The optical character recognition (OCR) program examines a picture of some kind of text and compares the sizes, patterns, and other attributes of the characters in the image to a set of characters that have already been specified. The program is able to identify, on the basis of this analysis, the text that is most likely being represented by the picture. An image of a scanned document that contains text is an example of OCR input. For instance, a scanned image of a page from a book or a scanned image of a printed document are both examples of this kind of input. An ordinary text file that contains the text that was extracted from the scanned paper is an example of the output of optical character recognition software. For instance, if the input is an image of a scanned page from a book, the output would be a plain text file containing the text of that page. This file could then be edited or searched using a text editor or word processor. If the input is an image of a scanned page from a magazine, the output would be a plain text file containing the text of that page.
