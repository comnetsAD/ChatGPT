Optical Character Recognition, or OCR, is a technique that gives computers the ability to detect and extract text from digital photos, scanned documents, and PDF files. OCR stands for "optical character recognition." The procedure comprises doing an analysis on a picture that contains text, identifying the characters that are present in the image, and transforming the image into text that can be read by a computer. An image of a scanned document that contains text would be an example of OCR input. For instance, a scanned PDF of a page from a book would be an example of this. The optical character recognition program would examine the picture, locate the characters within it, and then turn the image into text that could be read by a computer. The text that is retrieved from the picture is one example of the output of optical character recognition (OCR). This might be in the form of a plaintext file containing the text of the scanned page. Other software packages may then be used to do operations such as editing, searching, or processing on this text. Consider the following picture, which is a scanned copy of a page from a book: "The swift brown fox leaps over the slow dog." This image represents the text that appears on the page. The optical character recognition program would examine the picture, determine what characters it contained, and then turn the picture into text that a computer could read. The result would be in the form of simple text and read as follows: "The swift brown fox leaps over the slow dog." OCR has a wide range of potential applications, some of which include the digitization of books and papers, the automation of data input, and the rendering of digital pictures and scanned documents searchable for text.
