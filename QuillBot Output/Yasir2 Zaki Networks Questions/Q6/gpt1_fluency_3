ACK packets in the rdt3.0 protocol do not need sequence numbers since they are used to acknowledge the reception of data packets rather than send data itself. The ACK packets only have one field, which is the sequence number of the data packet that the ACK is acknowledging. The sequence numbers determine the order in which data packets are transferred. By providing a sequence number in the data packets, the sender may verify that the packets are sent to the receiver in the proper order, and the receiver can reassemble the data in the correct order using the sequence numbers. ACK packets do not need their own sequence numbers since they do not carry any data and are simply used to acknowledge the receipt of data packets. The ACK field in the ACK packets is sufficient to identify the received data packets. As a result, since ACK packets are not used to transmit data, they do not need sequence numbers in the rdt3.0 protocol and just need to have an ACK field to acknowledge the receipt of data packets.
