The rdt3.0 protocol does not need sequence numbers for ACK packets, which just acknowledge packet reception. rdt3.0 uses sequence numbers to identify and deliver packets in the proper order. The receiver acknowledges the sequence number packet using the ACK field in the ACK packet. ACK packets do not require sequence numbers since they merely acknowledge packet reception. They may acknowledge packets using the ACK field. ACK packets are smaller and do not need sequence numbering data, reducing protocol overhead. In conclusion, rdt3.0 protocol ACK packets do not need sequence numbers since they carry no data and just acknowledge the receipt of a previously transmitted packet.
