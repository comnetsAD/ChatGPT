Because ACK packets are only used to acknowledge the receipt of a packet and not to transmit data, the RDT3.0 protocol does not need them to have sequence numbers. This is because they are the sole purpose for which they are utilized. In a communication protocol such as rdt3.0, the sender delivers data packets to the receiver along with sequence numbers, and the receiver then sends ACK packets back to the sender to indicate that it has received the data packets. Since the ACK packets themselves do not carry any data, it is not necessary for there to be a sequence number associated with them. Instead, ACK packets include an ACK field that carries the sequence number of the data packet that the ACK is recognizing. This number is contained inside the ACK field of the ACK packet. This enables the sender to detect which data packets have been received by the receiver and which have not. It also enables the sender to determine which data packets have not been received. It is not necessary for the ACK packets to include sequence numbers since they do not carry any data and are just used to acknowledge the receipt of data packets. This makes the protocol easier to understand and decreases the amount of extra work required to send ACK packets.
