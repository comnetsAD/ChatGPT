ACK packets in the rdt3.0 protocol do not need sequence numbers since they are only used to acknowledge the receipt of data packets and not to send data. The single component of an ACK packet is the ACK field, which indicates the sequence number of the data packet being acknowledged. The sequence numbers are used to identify the transmission order of data packets. By providing a sequence number in the data packets, the sender may verify that the packets are sent to the receiver in the proper order, and the receiver can reassemble the data in the correct order using the sequence numbers. ACK packets do not need their own sequence numbers since they do not carry any data and are simply used to acknowledge the receipt of data packets. The ACK field in the ACK packets is adequate for identifying the received data packets. ACK packets do not need sequence numbers in the rdt3.0 protocol since they are not used to transmit data and just need to have an ACK field to acknowledge the receipt of data packets.
