Due to the fact that ACK packets in the rdt3.0 protocol are used to acknowledge the reception of data packets rather than to transmit data itself, the use of sequence numbers is not required for these packets. Only an ACK field, which provides the sequence number of the data packet that the ACK is recognizing, is included in the ACK packets. This field is called the ACK field. The sequence numbers are used to determine the order in which the data packets are transferred. This order may then be determined using the sequence numbers. The sender may guarantee that the data packets are sent to the receiver in the proper order by adding a sequence number in each data packet. The receiver can then use the sequence numbers to reassemble the data in the correct order. Sequence numbers are included in data packets. ACK packets do not need their own sequence numbers since they do not include any data and are solely used to acknowledge the reception of data packets. ACK packets are used to acknowledge the receipt of data packets. It is possible to determine which data packets have been received by examining the ACK field included inside the ACK packets. Consequently, in the RDT3.0 protocol, ACK packets do not need sequence numbers since they are not used to transmit data and only need to have an ACK field to acknowledge the reception of data packets. This is because ACK packets only serve to acknowledge the receipt of data packets.
