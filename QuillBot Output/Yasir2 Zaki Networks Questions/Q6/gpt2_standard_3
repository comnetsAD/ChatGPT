Since ACK packets in protocol rdt3.0 are only used to acknowledge the reception of packets and not to send data, they are exempt from the need for sequence numbers. In a protocol like rdt3.0, the sender delivers data packets with sequence numbers to the receiver, who then sends ACK packets back to the sender to confirm receipt. Since the ACK packets don't really carry any data, they don't need sequence numbers. The sequence number of the data packet that the ACK is recognizing is instead included in the ACK field of the ACK packets. This enables the sender to ascertain which data packets the recipient has and has not received. Sequence numbers are not necessary for the ACK packets since they merely serve to acknowledge the reception of data packets and do not carry any data themselves. This streamlines the protocol and lowers the cost of sending ACK messages.
