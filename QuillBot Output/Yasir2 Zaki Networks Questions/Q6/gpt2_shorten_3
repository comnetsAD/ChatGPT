ACK packets in rdt3.0 do not need sequence numbers since they merely acknowledge packet reception. In rdt3.0, the transmitter delivers sequence-numbered data packets to the recipient, and the receiver sends ACK packets to acknowledge receipt. Sequence numbers are unnecessary for ACK packets since they carry no data. Instead, ACK packets provide the sequence number of the data packet they acknowledge. This lets the sender know which data packets were received. ACK packets do not require sequence numbers since they just acknowledge data packets. ACK packet transmission is simplified and reduced.
