ACK packets in the rdt3.0 protocol do not need sequence numbers since they just acknowledge data packets. ACK packets simply carry the sequence number of the data packet they acknowledge. Sequence numbers indicate data packet transmission order. The sender may guarantee that the data packets reach the receiver in the right order by adding a sequence number, and the receiver can utilize the sequence numbers to reassemble the data. ACK packets have no sequence numbers since they just acknowledge data packets. ACK packets may identify received data packets using the ACK field. Since ACK packets just acknowledge data packet reception in the rdt3.0 protocol, they do not need sequence numbers.
