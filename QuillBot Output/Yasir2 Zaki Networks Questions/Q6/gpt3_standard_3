Since ACK packets in the rdt3.0 protocol simply serve to acknowledge the receipt of a packet and do not itself carry any data, they are exempt from the need for sequence numbers. Each packet transmitted using rdt3.0 has a unique sequence number that is used to identify the packet and guarantee that it is delivered to the recipient in the proper order. The ACK field of the ACK packet is used by the receiver to confirm receipt of the packet and provide a sequence number. ACK packets do not need their own sequence numbers since they just serve to acknowledge the receipt of other packets and do not carry any data. To specify which packet they are acknowledging, they may just utilize the ACK field. As a result, ACK packets are smaller and don't need extra fields for sequence numbering, lowering protocol overhead. In conclusion, as ACK packets in the rdt3.0 protocol simply serve to acknowledge the receipt of previously transmitted packets and do not include any data, they are exempt from the need for sequence numbers.
