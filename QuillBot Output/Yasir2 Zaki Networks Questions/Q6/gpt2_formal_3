ACK packets do not need sequence numbers in protocol rdt3.0 since they are just used to acknowledge the receipt of a packet and not to transfer data. In a protocol such as rdt3.0, the sender delivers data packets to the receiver with sequence numbers, and the receiver acknowledges receipt of the data packets by sending ACK packets back to the sender. The ACK packets do not include any data, hence they are not required to have sequence numbers. Instead, ACK packets include an ACK field with the sequence number of the data packet being acknowledged. This enables the sender to identify which data packets have been received and which have not. ACK packets do not need sequence numbers since they carry no data and are simply intended to acknowledge the receipt of data packets. This simplifies the protocol and decreases the transmission overhead of ACK messages.
