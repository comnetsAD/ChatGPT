Since ACK packets are used to acknowledge the reception of data packets rather than to send data itself, they are exempt from sequence number requirements in the rdt3.0 protocol. Only the ACK field, which contains the sequence number of the data packet that the ACK is acknowledging, is included in the ACK packets. The order in which the data packets are transferred is indicated by the sequence numbers. The sender may guarantee that the data packets are sent to the receiver in the right order by providing a sequence number, and the receiver can use the sequence numbers to reassemble the data in the right order. ACK packets don't need their own sequence numbers since they merely serve to acknowledge the reception of data packets and don't carry any data themselves. The data packets that have been received may be identified using the ACK field in the ACK packets. As a result, ACK packets in the rdt3.0 protocol do not need sequence numbers as they are solely used to acknowledge the reception of data packets rather than to send data itself.
