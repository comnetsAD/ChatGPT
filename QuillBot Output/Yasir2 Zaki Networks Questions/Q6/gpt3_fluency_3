ACK packets in the rdt3.0 protocol do not need sequence numbers since they are simply used to acknowledge the receipt of a packet and do not include any data. Each packet transmitted from the sender to the receiver in rdt3.0 is assigned a unique sequence number, which is used to identify the packet and guarantee that it is delivered in the right order. The ACK field of the ACK packet is used by the receiver to acknowledge receipt of the packet with the associated sequence number. ACK packets do not need their own sequence numbers since they do not carry any data and are just used to acknowledge the receipt of a packet. Instead, they may simply identify which packet they are recognizing by using the ACK field. Because ACK packets are smaller and do not need extra fields for sequence numbering, this helps to decrease protocol overhead. In summary, the rdt3.0 protocol does not need sequence numbers for ACK packets since they do not include any data and are simply intended to acknowledge the receipt of a previously transmitted packet.
