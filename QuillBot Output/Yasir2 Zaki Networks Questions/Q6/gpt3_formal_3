ACK packets do not need sequence numbers in the rdt3.0 protocol since they are solely used to acknowledge the receipt of a packet and do not carry any data. Each packet transmitted from the sender to the receiver in rdt3.0 has a unique sequence number that is used to identify the packet and guarantee that it is delivered in the right order. The ACK field of the ACK packet is used by the receiver to acknowledge receipt of the packet with the associated sequence number. ACK packets do not need their own sequence numbers since they do not carry any data and are just used to acknowledge the receipt of a packet. They may instead utilize the ACK field to specify which packet they are acknowledging. This reduces the protocol's overhead, since ACK packets are smaller and do not need extra sequence numbering fields. ACK packets in the rdt3.0 protocol do not need sequence numbers since they carry no data and are solely used to acknowledge the receipt of a previously sent packet.
