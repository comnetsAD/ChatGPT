ACK packets in the rdt3.0 protocol do not need sequence numbers since its only purpose is to acknowledge the receipt of a packet and they do not carry any data of their own. In rdt3.0, every single packet that is sent from the sender to the receiver is assigned a one-of-a-kind sequence number. This number is used to identify the packet and to make certain that it is delivered in the appropriate sequence. The receiver will acknowledge the receipt of the packet containing the matching sequence number by using the ACK field that is included inside the ACK packet. ACK packets are not required to have their own sequence numbers since they do not carry any data and are just used to acknowledge the receipt of a packet. They need only utilize the ACK field to specify which packet they are acknowledging rather than using any other method. Because of this, the overhead of the protocol is reduced, since ACK packets are less extensive and do not need any extra fields for sequence numbering. Because they do not include any data and are only used to acknowledge the receipt of a previously sent packet, ACK packets in the rdt3.0 protocol do not need sequence numbers. This is because they are only used to confirm that a previously sent packet has been received.
