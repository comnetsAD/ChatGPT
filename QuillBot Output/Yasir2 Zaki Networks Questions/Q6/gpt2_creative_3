The sender uses sequence numbers to identify each data packet they send to the receiver, and the receiver acknowledges the sender's receipt of those packets by sending an ACK packet. Since the ACK packets are empty, there is no need to provide sequence numbers to them. On the other hand, the sequence number of the data packet being acknowledged may be found in the ACK field of the corresponding ACK packet. In this way, the sender can tell whether or not the recipient has received all of the data packets sent. ACK packets do not need sequence numbers since they do not include any data and are simply intended to confirm that they have been received.
