ACK packets in protocol rdt3.0 do not need sequence numbers since they are just used to acknowledge the receipt of a packet and not to transfer data. In a protocol such as rdt3.0, the sender delivers data packets with sequence numbers to the receiver, and the receiver sends ACK packets back to the sender to acknowledge receipt of the data packets. Because the ACK packets do not include any data, they do not need sequence numbers. Instead, ACK packets include an ACK field that specifies the sequence number of the data packet being acknowledged. This enables the sender to detect which data packets were and were not received by the recipient. ACK packets do not need sequence numbers since they do not carry any data and are simply used to acknowledge the receipt of data packets. This simplifies the protocol and lowers the overhead associated with sending ACK messages.
