The server must upload the file to each of the N peers in order to distribute the file via client-server distribution. As a result, the following is the total time required to distribute the file via client-server distribution: T client-server equals F/(us/N)/15 Gbits/30 Mbps/N. Each peer must download the file from other peers in the swarm in order to disseminate the file using peer-to-peer (P2P) technology. Therefore, the total time required to distribute the file through P2P is: T P2P is equal to F/(di/N) = 15 Gbits/(2 Mbps/N) The minimal distribution time for each of the N and u combinations for client-server and P2P distribution is shown in the following graph: T client-server N u (seconds) T P2P (seconds) (seconds) 5,000 75,000 10 700 Kbps, 10 300 Kbps 2,142 33,333\s10 2 Mbps 750 12,500\s100 300 Kbps 500 7,500\s100 700 Kbps 214 3,333\s100 75 1,250 1,000 300 Kbps, 50 750 1,000 700 Kbps, and 21 333 at 2 Mbps. 1,000 2 Mbps 7.5 125
