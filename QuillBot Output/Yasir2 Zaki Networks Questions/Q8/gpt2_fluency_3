To use client-server distribution, the server must upload the file to each of the N peers. As a result, the total time required to disseminate the file using client-server distribution is: T client-server = F / (30 Mbps / N) = 15 Gbits To spread the file through P2P, each peer must download it from other peers in the swarm. The total time required to distribute the file using P2P distribution is thus: T P2P is defined as F / (di / N) = 15 Gbits / (2 Mbps / N). Here is a graph that shows the minimal distribution time for each of the N and u combinations for both client-server and peer-to-peer distribution: T client-server N u T client-server (seconds) T P2P (seconds) (seconds) 5,000 75,000 10 700 Kbps 10 300 Kbps 2,142 33,333\s10 2 Mbps 750 12,500\s100 300 Kbps 500 7,500\s100 700 Kbps 214 3,333\s100 2 Mbps 75 1,250 1,000 300 Kbps 50 750 1,700 Kbps 21 333 1,000 2 Mbps 7.5 125
