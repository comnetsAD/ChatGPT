The minimal distribution time for each of the N and u combinations for client-server and P2P distribution is shown in the following graph: N u Client-Server (Kbps) (Hours) P2P (Hours) (Hours) 10 300 0.525 0.525\s10 700 0.525 0.525\s10 2,000 0.525 0.525\s100 300 0.525 5.250\s100 700 0.525 2.625\s100 2,000 0.525 0.525\s1,000 300 5.250 52.500\s1,000 700 2.625 26.250\s1,000 2,000 0.525 5.250 We may use the following formula to get the minimal distribution time for client-server distribution: / us T client-server = F We may use the following formula to get the minimal distribution time for P2P distribution: T P2P equals F/(N * di). Due to the fact that each peer in the swarm is uploading data to other peers in the swarm, the minimum distribution time for P2P distribution depends on the value of u. The file may be transferred more quickly the greater the value of u. The distribution time may, however, take a lot longer if u is too low since the peers might not have adequate bandwidth to transfer data to other peers in the swarm.
