The minimal distribution time for any combination of N and u for client-server distribution and P2P distribution is shown in the following graph: Client-server N (min) P2P (min) (min) 10 700 Kbps 23.846 0.769 10 2 Mbps 10 300 Kbps 52.5 1.5 5.25 15.100 700 Kbps 7.5 0.25 100 300 Kbps 75 2.5 1,000 300 Kbps 5250 150 1,000 700 Kbps 238.46 7.69 100 2 Mbps 2384.6 76.9\s1,000 2 Mbps 750 25 The following formulae may be used to determine the minimal distribution time for any combination of N and u: Distribution of clients and servers: T = F / (N * di) T = F / (N * di + (N - 1) * u) for peer-to-peer distribution. In these equations, T stands for the minimal distribution time, F for the file size (15 Gbits), N for the number of peers, di for each peer's download speed (2 Mbps), and u for each peer's upload speed.
