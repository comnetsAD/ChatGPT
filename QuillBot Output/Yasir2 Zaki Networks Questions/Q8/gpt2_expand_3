In client-server distribution, the server must first upload the file to each of the N peers before the file can be distributed to the clients. The following is a calculation of the total amount of time required to distribute the file using client-server distribution: T client-server = F / (us / N) = 15 Gbits / (30 Mbps / N) When employing P2P distribution, each peer in the swarm is required to download the file from the other peers in the swarm in order to successfully distribute the content. The following equation may be used to calculate the total amount of time needed to distribute the file using the P2P distribution method: T P2P = F / (di / N) = 15 Gbits / (2 Mbps / N) The following figure presents the minimal amount of time required for distribution for each of the possible combinations of N and u, considering both client-server and peer-to-peer distribution: N u T client-server (seconds) T P2P (seconds) (seconds) 2,142 33,333\s10 2 Mbps 750 12,500\s100 300 Kbps 500 7,500\s100 700 Kbps 214 3,333\s100 2 Mbps 75 1,250 1,000 300 Kbps 50 750 1,000 700 Kbps 21 333 1,000 2 Mbps 7.5 125
