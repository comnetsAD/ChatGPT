This graphic shows the minimal distribution time for each combination of N and u for client-server and P2P distribution: Kbps client-server (Hours) P2P (Hours) (Hours) 10 300 0.525 0.525\s10 700 0.525 0.525\s10 2,000 0.525 0.525\s100 300 0.525 5.250\s100 700 0.525 2.625\s100 2,000 0.525 0.525\s1,000 300 5.250 52.500\s1,000 700 2.625 26.250\s1,000 2,000 0.525 5.250 This formula calculates client-server distribution's minimal distribution time: T client-server = F/us The following formula calculates the minimal P2P distribution time: F/(N*di) = T P2P. Since each peer uploads data to the swarm, the minimal P2P distribution time depends on u. The file distributes quicker as u increases. If u is too low, peers may not have adequate bandwidth to upload data to other swarm peers, extending distribution time.
