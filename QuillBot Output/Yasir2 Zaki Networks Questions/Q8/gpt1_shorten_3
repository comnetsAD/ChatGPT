This graphic shows the minimal distribution time for each combination of N and u for client-server and P2P distribution: Client-server (min) P2P (min) (min) 10.300 Kbps 52.5 1.5 10.700 Kbps 23.846 0.769 10.2 Mbps 525 15 100 700 Kbps 100 2 Mbps 75 2.5 1,000 300 Kbps 5250 150 1,000 700 Kbps 2384.6 76.9\s1,000 2 Mbps 750 25 These formulae find the minimal distribution time for each combination of N and u: Client-server distribution: T = F/(N * di). P2P distribution: T = F / (N* di + (N - 1)* u). T is the minimum distribution time, F is the file size (15 Gbits), N is the number of peers, di is the download rate (2 Mbps), and u is the upload rate (2 Mbps).
