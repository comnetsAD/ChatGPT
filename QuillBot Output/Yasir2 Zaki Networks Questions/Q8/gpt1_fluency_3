Here is a graph that shows the minimal distribution time for each combination of N and u for both client-server and peer-to-peer distribution: Client-server N u (min) P2P (min) (min) 10 300 kbps 52.5 1.5 Mbps 10 700 kbps 23.846 0.769 Mbps 10 2 Mbps 525 15 100 700 Kbps 7.5 0.25 100 300 Kbps 5250 150 1,000 700 Kbps 238.46 7.69 100 2 Mbps 75 2.5 1,000 300 Kbps 2384.6 76.9\s1,000 2 Mbps 750 25 The following formulae may be used to compute the minimal distribution time for any combination of N and u: T = F / (N * di) client-server distribution T = F / (N * di + (N - 1) * u) P2P distribution T denotes the minimum distribution time, F the file size (15 Gbits), N the number of peers, di the download rate of each peer (2 Mbps), and u the upload rate of each peer.
