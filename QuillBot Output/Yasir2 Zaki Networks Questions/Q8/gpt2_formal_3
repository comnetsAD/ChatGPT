For client-server file distribution, the server must upload the file to each of the N peers. Therefore, the total time required to disseminate a file via client-server distribution is: F / (us / N) = 15 Gbits / (30 Mbps / N). Each peer must download the file from other peers in the swarm in order to disseminate the file via P2P distribution. Therefore, the total time required to disseminate the file via P2P distribution is: T P2P = F / (di / N) = 15 Gbits / (2 Mbps / N) This graphic illustrates the minimal distribution time for each combination of N and u for both client-server and P2P distribution: N u T client-server (seconds) T P2P (seconds) (seconds) 10 300 Kbps 5,000 75,000 10 700 Kbps 2,142 33,333\s10 2 Mbps 750 12,500\s100 300 Kbps 500 7,500\s100 700 Kbps 214 3,333\s100 2 Mbps 75 1,250 1,000 300 Kbps 50 750 1,000 700 Kbps 21 333 1,000 2 Mbps 7.5 125
