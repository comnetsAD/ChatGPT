Client-server distribution requires the server to upload the file to N peers. Client-server file distribution takes: T client-server = F / (us / N) = 15 Gbits/30 Mbps/N P2P distribution requires each peer to download the file from the swarm. P2P file distribution takes: 15 Gbits/2 Mbps = T P2P. This graphic shows the minimal distribution time for each combination of N and u for client-server and P2P distribution: T client-server (seconds) T P2P (seconds) (seconds) 10300 Kbps 5,000 75,000 10700 Kbps 2,142 33,333\s10 2 Mbps 750 12,500\s100 300 Kbps 500 7,500\s100 700 Kbps 214 3,333\s100 2 Mbps 75 1,250 1,000 300 Kbps 50 750 1,000 700 Kbps 21 333 1,000 2 Mbps 7.5 125
