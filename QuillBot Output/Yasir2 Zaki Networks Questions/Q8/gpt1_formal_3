This graphic illustrates the minimal distribution time for each combination of N and u for both client-server and P2P distribution: N u Client-server (min) P2P (min) (min) 10 300 Kbps 52.5 1.5 10 700 Kbps 23.846 0.769 10 2 Mbps 7.5 0.25 100 300 Kbps 525 15 100 700 Kbps 238.46 7.69 100 2 Mbps 75 2.5 1,000 300 Kbps 5250 150 1,000 700 Kbps 2384.6 76.9\s1,000 2 Mbps 750 25 To get the minimal distribution time for any combination of N and u, the following formulae may be utilized: Client-server distribution: T = F / (N * di) P2P distribution: T = F / (N * di + (N - 1) * u) T is the minimum distribution time, F represents the file size (15 Gbits), N represents the number of peers, di represents the download rate of each peer (2 Mbps), and u represents the upload rate of each peer.
