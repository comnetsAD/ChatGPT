This graphic illustrates the minimal distribution time for each combination of N and u for both client-server and P2P distribution: N u (Kbps) Client-Server (Hours) P2P (Hours) (Hours) 10 300 0.525 0.525\s10 700 0.525 0.525\s10 2,000 0.525 0.525\s100 300 0.525 5.250\s100 700 0.525 2.625\s100 2,000 0.525 0.525\s1,000 300 5.250 52.500\s1,000 700 2.625 26.250\s1,000 2,000 0.525 5.250 To determine the minimal distribution time for client-server distribution, the following formula may be used: The formula T client-server = F / us To determine the minimal distribution time for P2P distribution, the following formula may be used: T P2P = F / (N * di) As each peer uploads data to other peers in the swarm, the minimal distribution time for P2P distribution is dependent on the value of u. The greater u's value, the quicker a file may be transferred. Nonetheless, if u is too low, the distribution time may be greatly lengthened, since peers may not have sufficient bandwidth to transfer data to other peers in the swarm.
