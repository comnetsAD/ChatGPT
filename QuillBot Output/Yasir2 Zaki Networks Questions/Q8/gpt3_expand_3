The following figure presents the minimal amount of time required for distribution for each of the possible combinations of N and u, considering both client-server and peer-to-peer distribution: N u (Kbps) Client-Server (Hours) P2P (Hours) (Hours) 10 300 0.525 0.525\s10 700 0.525 0.525\s10 2,000 0.525 0.525\s100 300 0.525 5.250\s100 700 0.525 2.625\s100 2,000 0.525 0.525\s1,000 300 5.250 52.500\s1,000 700 2.625 26.250\s1,000 2,000 0.525 5.250 Utilizing the following method, we should be able to determine the bare minimal amount of time required for client-server distribution: T client-server equals F divided by us Utilizing the following formula, we are able to determine the bare minimal amount of time required for P2P distribution: T P2P = F / (N * di) Because every peer in the swarm is uploading data to the other peers in the swarm, it is important to note that the minimal distribution time for P2P distribution is dependent on the value of u. When u is set to a larger number, the speed at which the file may be delivered increases. However, if u is too low, the distribution time may be greatly prolonged because the peers in the swarm may not have sufficient bandwidth to upload data to other peers in the swarm. This might cause the distribution time to be much longer.
