The following graphic provides an illustration of the minimal amount of time required for distribution for each possible combination of N and u, including both client-server and P2P distribution models: N u Client-server (min) P2P (min) (min) 10 300 Kbps 52.5 1.5 10 700 Kbps 23.846 0.769 10 2 Mbps 7.5 0.25 100 300 Kbps 525 15 100 700 Kbps 238.46 7.69 100 2 Mbps 75 2.5 1,000 300 Kbps 5250 150 1,000 700 Kbps 2384.6 76.9\s1,000 2 Mbps 750 25 We may use the following formulae to compute the lowest amount of time needed for distribution for each possible combination of N and u: Client-server distribution: T = F / (N * di) P2P distribution: T = F / (N * di + (N - 1) * u) In these equations, T stands for the minimal distribution time, F stands for the size of the file (15 Gbits), N stands for the number of peers, di stands for the download rate that each peer achieves (two Mbps), and u stands for the upload rate that each peer achieves.
