Here is a graph that shows the minimal distribution time for each of the N and u combinations for both client-server and peer-to-peer distribution: Client-Server N (Kbps) (Hours) P2P (Hours) (Hours) 10 300 0.525 0.525\s10 700 0.525 0.525\s10 2,000 0.525 0.525\s100 300 0.525 5.250\s100 700 0.525 2.625\s100 2,000 0.525 0.525\s1,000 300 5.250 52.500\s1,000 700 2.625 26.250\s1,000 2,000 0.525 5.250 We may use the following formula to obtain the minimal distribution time for client-server distribution: / us T client-server = F We may use the following formula to obtain the minimal distribution time for P2P distribution: F / (N * di) T P2P Because each peer uploads data to other peers in the swarm, the minimum distribution time for P2P distribution is dependent on the value of u. The greater the value of u, the more quickly the file may be delivered. However, if u is too low, the distribution time will be much longer since the peers may not have adequate bandwidth to post data to other swarm peers.
