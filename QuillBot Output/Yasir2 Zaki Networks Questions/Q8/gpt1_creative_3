In this table, we demonstrate the P2P and client-server distribution minimum times for various values of N and u. C o m p u t e r s e (min) P2P (min) (min) Speeds of ten megabits per second (Mbps) are measured in "kilobits per second" (kbps). 7,5 0.2 525 15,100,700 kilobits per second 238.46 Mbps 7.69 Mbps 100 2 Mbps 75.2 Mbps 1,000 300 KBps 5250 Mbps 1 GBps 700 KBps 2384.6 76.9\s1,000 2 Mbps 750 25 The following formulae may be used to determine the minimal distribution time for any given values of N and u: T = F / (N * di) for a client-server distribution model. T = F / (N * di + (N - 1) * u) is the formula for a P2P distribution. T is the smallest amount of time required for a file to be distributed, F is the size of the file (15 Gbits), N is the total number of peers, di is the download speed of each peer (2 Mbps), and u is the upload speed of each peer.
