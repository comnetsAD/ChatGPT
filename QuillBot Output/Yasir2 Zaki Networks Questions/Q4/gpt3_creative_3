Further, up to time = 6 RTT, what has been the typical overall (MSS and RTT) performance of this link? in the body of an HTTP request message? Without loss occurrences, it would take 6 RTT for cwnd to climb from 6 MSS to 12 MSS if TCP used AIMD for congestion management and cwnd increased by 1 MSS after each batch of ACKs was received. This is because it takes 1 RTT to get a batch of ACKs, and every MSS in the counter grows after receiving an ACK. When t = 6 RTT, the average throughout would be cwnd / RTT, or (6 MSS) / (1 RTT) = 6 MSS/RTT. The average throughput of an HTTP request message is proportional to the message size and round-trip time of the connection. The average throughput would be M / RTT bits/second if the HTTP request message is M bits in length and the connection's round-trip time is RTT seconds.
