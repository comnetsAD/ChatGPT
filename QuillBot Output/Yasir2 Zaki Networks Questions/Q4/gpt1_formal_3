Every time a batch of ACKs is received on a TCP connection using AIMD for congestion management, cwnd will rise by 1 MSS. If cwnd begins at 6 MSS and we want to expand it to 12 MSS, the increase will need 6 RTT. The average throughput for this connection up to time = 6 RTT is the product of cwnd and MSS divided by the RTT. Consequently, the average throughput will equal 6 MSS * MSS / RTT. The average throughput of an HTTP request message is dependent on the specifics of the request. The average throughput may be affected by the size of the requested resource, the bandwidth and latency of the network connection, and the server's processing speed. It is not feasible to calculate the average throughput of an HTTP request without additional information on the individual request.
