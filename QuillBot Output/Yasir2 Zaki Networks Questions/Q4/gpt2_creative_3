With AIMD-based congestion management and no sluggish start in TCP, it takes 6 RTTs for cwnd to double from 6 MSS to 12 MSS. This is because it takes RTT for an ACK to be received after a packet has been delivered, and cwnd is incremented by 1 MSS whenever a batch of ACKs is received. Up to time = 6 RTT, the average throughput of this connection will be cwnd / RTT. If the round-trip time (RTT) is one second and the channel width (cwnd) is six multiples of a second, the average bandwidth will be six multiples of a second. The average length of an HTTP request message is proportional to the request's size and the connection's round-trip duration. Take a request of 1000 bytes in size and a round-trip duration of 0.5 seconds; the average throughput will be 2000 bytes per second.
