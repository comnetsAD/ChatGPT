Whenever a batch of ACKs is received in a TCP connection that does not experience any loss and makes use of AIMD for congestion management, the connection window size (cwnd) will grow by one MSS. If we begin with cwnd set at 6 MSS and our goal is to raise it to 12 MSS, then it will take 6 RTT to raise cwnd from its current setting of 6 MSS to the desired setting of 12 MSS. The product of the cwnd and MSS values, divided by the RTT, will give you an estimate of the average throughput for this connection up until time equals time = 6 RTT. To put it another way, the typical throughput will be proportional to 6 MSS * MSS divided by RTT. The specifics of an HTTP request will determine how it affects the message's average throughput, which is referred to as the throughput. The amount of the resource that was requested, as well as the bandwidth and latency of the connection to the network, as well as the processing time of the server, are all factors that might have an effect on the average throughput. Without further information about the individual request that is being made, it is not feasible to establish with any degree of precision the average throughput of an HTTP request.
