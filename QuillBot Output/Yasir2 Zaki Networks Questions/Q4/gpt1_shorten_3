Every batch of ACKs received in a TCP connection with no loss and AIMD congestion management increases cwnd by 1 MSS. Increasing cwnd from 6 MSS to 12 MSS takes 6 RTT. This connection's average throughput up to 6 RTT will be the product of cwnd and MSS divided by RTT. The average throughput is 6 MSS * MSS / RTT. The average throughput of an HTTP request depends on its conditions. The average throughput depends on resource size, network speed and latency, and server processing time. Without knowing the HTTP request, it is impossible to calculate its average throughput.
