Furthermore, what is the overall average (in terms of MSS and RTT) for this connection up to time = 6 RTT? in the body of an HTTP request message? Assuming that TCP employs AIMD for congestion management and that cwnd rises by 1 MSS every time a batch of ACKs is received, it will take 6 RTT for cwnd to climb from 6 MSS to 12 MSS, assuming no loss occurrences. This is because cwnd rises by 1 MSS for each batch of ACKs received, and a batch of ACKs takes 1 RTT to receive. The average through time for this connection would be cwnd / RTT, or (6 MSS) / (1 RTT) = 6 MSS/RTT. The average across an HTTP request message would be determined by the message's size and the RTT of the connection. If the HTTP request message is M bits long and the RTT of the connection is RTT seconds, the average rate will be M / RTT bits per second.
