TCP utilizing AIMD for congestion management without delayed start will require 6 RTTs to boost cwnd from 6 MSS to 12 MSS. Every batch of ACKs received increases cwnd by 1 MSS, and it takes RTT to get an ACK after a packet is delivered. This connection's average up to 6 RTT will be cwnd/RTT. If cwnd = 6 MSS and RTT = 1 sec, the average throughout is 6 MSS/sec. The average across an HTTP request message depends on its size and connection round-trip time. If the request is 1000 bytes and the round-trip duration is 0.5 seconds, the average will be 2000 bytes/sec.
