What is the typical RTT and MSS during the course of this connection up to time = 6 RTT, as well? in a message for an HTTP request? It will take 6 RTT for cwnd to climb from 6 MSS to 12 MSS, assuming no loss events, if TCP employs AIMD for its congestion management without delayed start and that cwnd increases by 1 MSS every time a batch of ACKs is received. This is due to the fact that cwnd grows by 1 MSS for each batch of ACKs received and that a batch of ACKs requires 1 RTT to be received. The average throughout the whole period of time for this connection would be cwnd / RTT, or (6 MSS) / (1 RTT) = 6 MSS/RTT. The average length of an HTTP request message depends on the message's size and the connection's RTT. The average speed would be M / RTT bits/second if the HTTP request message had a size of M bits and the connection's RTT was RTT seconds.
