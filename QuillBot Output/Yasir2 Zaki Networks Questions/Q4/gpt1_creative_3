In a lossless TCP connection using AIMD for congestion management, cwnd will grow by 1 MSS whenever a packet group of ACKs is received. If cwnd is now at 6 MSS and we want to raise it to 12 MSS, doing so will need 6 RTT. It can be shown that the average throughput for this connection up to time = 6 RTT is equal to the product of cwnd and MSS divided by the RTT. Or, we may express the average throughput as 6 MSS * MSS / RTT. The typical throughput of an HTTP request message is conditional upon the request's details. Size of the requested resource, bandwidth and latency of the network connection, and server processing time are all variables that might affect the typical throughput. The average throughput of an HTTP request cannot be calculated without knowing more about the request itself.
