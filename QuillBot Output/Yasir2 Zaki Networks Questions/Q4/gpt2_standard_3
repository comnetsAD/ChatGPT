It will take 6 RTTs for cwnd to climb from 6 MSS to 12 MSS if TCP is utilizing AIMD for congestion management without delayed start and assuming that cwnd increases by 1 MSS every time a batch of ACKs is received. This is due to the fact that each time a batch of ACKs is received, cwnd grows by 1 MSS, and it takes RTT for an ACK to be received after a packet has been delivered. The average for this connection for the whole period of time = 6 RTT will equal cwnd / RTT. For instance, the average speed will be 6 MSS/sec if the cwnd is 6 MSS and the RTT is 1 sec. The average length of an HTTP request message depends on the request's size and the connection's round-trip duration. The average speed will be 2000 bytes/sec if the request is 1000 bytes in size and the round-trip duration is 0.5 seconds.
