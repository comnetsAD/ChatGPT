In addition, what has been the typical performance (both in terms of MSS and RTT) of this connection up to the point when there have been 6 RTT? in an HTTP request message? Assuming that TCP employs AIMD for its congestion control without employing slow start, and assuming that cwnd increases by 1 MSS each time a batch of ACKs is received, it will take 6 RTT for cwnd to increase from 6 MSS to 12 MSS, assuming that there are no loss events. This is based on the assumption that there will be no loss events. This is due to the fact that cwnd rises by 1 MSS for each batch of ACKs received, and it takes 1 RTT for ACKs to be received in batches. The average throughput for this connection up to time equal to six RTT would be cwnd / RTT, which is the same as saying that six MSS per one RTT is the average throughput for this connection. The typical throughput of an HTTP request message is determined by the total size of the message as well as the round-trip time of the connection. If the size of the HTTP request message is M bits, and the RTT of the connection is RTT seconds, then the overall average would be M bits divided by RTT seconds per second.
