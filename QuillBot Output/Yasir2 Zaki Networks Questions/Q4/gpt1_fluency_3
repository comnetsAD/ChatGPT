When a batch of ACKs is received on a TCP connection with no loss and utilizing AIMD for congestion management, cwnd increases by 1 MSS. If we start with cwnd at 6 MSS and attempt to expand it to 12 MSS, it will take 6 RTT to go from 6 MSS to 12 MSS. The average throughput for this connection will be equal to the product of cwnd and MSS divided by the RTT. In other words, the average throughput is 6 MSS * MSS / RTT. The average throughput of an HTTP request message is determined by the exact conditions of the request. The size of the requested resource, the bandwidth and latency of the network connection, and the server's processing time are all factors that might affect average throughput. Without further information about the individual request, determining the average throughput of an HTTP request is impossible.
