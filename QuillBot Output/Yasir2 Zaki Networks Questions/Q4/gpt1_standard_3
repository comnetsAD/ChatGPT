Every time a batch of ACKs is received on a TCP connection that has no loss and is utilizing AIMD for congestion management, cwnd will rise by 1 MSS. It will take 6 RTT to raise cwnd from 6 MSS to 12 MSS if we start with a cwnd of 6 MSS and attempt to grow it to 12. The product of cwnd and MSS, divided by the RTT, will equal the average throughput for this connection up to time = 6 RTT. Alternatively stated, the average throughput will be 6 MSS * MSS / RTT. The typical throughput of an HTTP request message depends on the particulars of the request. The size of the requested resource, the network connection's bandwidth and latency, and the server's processing speed are all variables that might affect the average throughput. Without further details about the particular request being performed, it is impossible to calculate the average throughput of an HTTP request with any degree of accuracy.
