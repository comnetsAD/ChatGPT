What's this connection's average MSS and RTT up to 6 RTT? an HTTP request? If TCP utilizes AIMD for congestion management without delayed start and cwnd rises by 1 MSS every time a batch of ACKs is received, it will take 6 RTT to climb from 6 MSS to 12 MSS, assuming no loss occurrences. Every batch of ACKs received raises cwnd by 1 MSS and requires 1 RTT. cwnd / RTT = 6 MSS/RTT is the average for this connection up to time = 6 RTT. The average across an HTTP request message depends on its size and connection RTT. The average overall is M/RTT bits/second if the HTTP request message is M bits and the connection RTT is RTT seconds.
