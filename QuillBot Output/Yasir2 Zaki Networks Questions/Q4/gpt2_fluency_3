If TCP uses AIMD for congestion management without delayed start, and cwnd grows by 1 MSS after each batch of ACKs, it will take 6 RTTs for cwnd to climb from 6 MSS to 12 MSS. This is due to the fact that when a batch of ACKs is received, cwnd is raised by 1 MSS, and it takes RTT for an ACK to be received after a packet is delivered. The average through time = 6 RTT for this connection will be equal to cwnd / RTT. For example, if cwnd = 6 MSS and RTT = 1 sec, the average speed will be 6 MSS/sec throughout. The average across an HTTP request message is determined by the size of the request and the round-trip duration of the connection. For example, if the request is 1000 bytes in size and the round-trip time is 0.5 seconds, the overall average will be 2000 bytes/sec.
