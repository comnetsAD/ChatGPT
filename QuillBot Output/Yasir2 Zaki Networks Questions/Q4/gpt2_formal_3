If TCP is utilizing AIMD for congestion management without delayed start and cwnd rises by 1 MSS each time a batch of ACKs is received, it will take 6 RTTs for cwnd to climb from 6 MSS to 12 MSS. This is due to the fact that cwnd is incremented by 1 MSS whenever a batch of ACKs is received, and it takes RTT for an ACK to be received after a packet has been delivered. This connection's average throughput up to time = 6 RTT will be equal to cwnd / RTT. For instance, if cwnd is 6 MSS and RTT equals 1 second, the overall average will be 6 MSS/second. The average duration of an HTTP request message depends on the size of the request and the round-trip time of the connection. For instance, if the request is 1000 bytes in size and the round-trip time is 0.5 seconds, the average throughout will be 2000 bytes per second.
