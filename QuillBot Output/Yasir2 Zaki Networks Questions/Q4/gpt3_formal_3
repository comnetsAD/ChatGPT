Furthermore, what is the average MSS and RTT for this connection up to time = 6 RTT? in an HTTP request message? Assuming TCP employs AIMD for congestion management without delayed start and that cwnd rises by 1 MSS each time a batch of ACKs is received, it will take 6 RTT for cwnd to climb from 6 MSS to 12 MSS in the absence of loss events. This is due to the fact that cwnd rises by 1 MSS for each batch of ACKs received, and it takes 1 RTT to get a batch of ACKs. The average for this connection up to time = 6 RTT is cwnd / RTT, or (6 MSS) / (1 RTT) = 6 MSS/RTT. The average throughput of an HTTP request message depends on the size of the message and the RTT of the connection. If the HTTP request message is M bits in length and the connection's RTT is RTT seconds, the average throughout would be M / RTT bits per second.
