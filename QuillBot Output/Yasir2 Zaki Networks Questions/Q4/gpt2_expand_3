If TCP is using AIMD for congestion control without using slow start, and assuming that cwnd increases by 1 MSS every time a batch of ACKs is received, then it will take 6 RTTs for cwnd to increase from 6 MSS to 12 MSS. This is because every time a batch of ACKs is received, cwnd increases by one MSS. This is due to the fact that cwnd is incremented by one MSS each time a batch of ACKs is received, and the time it takes for an ACK to be received after a packet has been delivered is denoted by the RTT. This connection's average during the whole process up until time = 6 RTT will be equal to cwnd divided by RTT. For instance, if the cwnd value is six MSS and the RTT value is one second, the average throughout will be six MSS per second. The typical throughput of an HTTP request message is determined by the whole length of the request as well as the total amount of time it takes for the connection to complete one full cycle. For illustration purposes, if the total size of the request is 1000 bytes and the round-trip time is 0.5 seconds, the average throughput for the whole transaction will be 2000 bytes per second.
