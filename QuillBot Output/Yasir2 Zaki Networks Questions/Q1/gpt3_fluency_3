The CRC value for the given generator G and data D is 0101010. To compute the CRC, we divide the data D by the generator G modulo-2. This entails dividing D by G using binary arithmetic, the single operation being modulo-2 addition (also known as XOR). In this example, the divide would look like this: D: 1010101010\sG: 10011 01010\s 1 0011 ————-\s 1001\s 0 0101 ————\s 0001 1001\s ————\s 0000 This division's residual is 0000, which is the CRC for the provided data D and generator G.
