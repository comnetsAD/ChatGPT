0101010 is the value of the CRC when applied to the data D and generator G that was supplied. To compute the CRC, we first execute a modulo-2 division of the data D by the generator G. This step is followed by the CRC calculation. This requires employing binary arithmetic, in which the sole operation is addition on a modulo-2 scale, to do the division of D by G. (also known as XOR). In this particular scenario, the partitioning would take place as follows: D: 1010101010\sG: 10011 01010\s 1 0011 ————-\s 1001\s 0 0101 ————\s 0001 1001\s ————\s 0000 The remainder of this division is 0000, which is the CRC for the data that has been supplied and the generator that has been given.
