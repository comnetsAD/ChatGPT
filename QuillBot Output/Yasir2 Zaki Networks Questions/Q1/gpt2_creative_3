Using this generator and that data value, the CRC comes out to 011. Before attempting to compute the CRC, we must first zero-pad the data value to make it the same length as the generator. Padded data value is 10101010100000 in this example. The next step is a modulo-2 division of the padded data value by the generator. CRC refers to the remaining portion of this section. With modulo-2 division, we obtain: 10101010100000\s10011\s10011\s100110\s00000\s10011\s011 The residue after dividing by the CRC value is 011.
