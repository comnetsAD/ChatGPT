If we use generator G and data D, then the resulting CRC is 0101010. The CRC is found by dividing the data set D by a random number generator G using a modulo-2 operation. This requires employing binary math, where modulo-2 addition is the sole operation, to divide D by G. (also known as XOR). The breakdown in this situation would look like this: D: 1010101010\sG: 10011 01010\s 1 0011 ————-\s 1001\s 0 0101 ————\s 0001 1001\s ————\s 0000 Given data D and generator G, the remainder of this division is 0000, which is the CRC.
