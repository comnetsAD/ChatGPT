0101010 is the value of the CRC for the given generator G and data D. To compute the CRC, the data D is divided modulo-2 by the generator G. This entails dividing D by G using binary arithmetic, where modulo-2 addition is the sole operation (also known as XOR). In this instance, the split would take place as follows: D: 1010101010\sG: 10011 01010\s 1 0011 ————-\s 1001\s 0 0101 ————\s 0001 1001\s ————\s 0000 This remainder is 0000, which is the CRC for the provided data D and generator G.
