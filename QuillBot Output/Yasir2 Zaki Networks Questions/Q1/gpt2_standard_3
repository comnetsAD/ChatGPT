For the specified generator and data value, the CRC value is 011. The data value must first be padded with zeros until it is the same length as the generator before the CRC can be calculated. The padded data value in this instance is 10101010100000. The padded data value is then divided by the generator using modulo-2 division. The CRC makes up the rest of this division. When we divide by modulo-2, we obtain: 10101010100000\s10011\s10011\s100110\s00000\s10011\s011 011 is the value of the CRC, which is the division's remaining fraction.
