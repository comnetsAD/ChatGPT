For the specified generator G and data D, the CRC value is 0101010. We divide the data D by the generator G in modulo-2 order to get the CRC. This entails employing binary arithmetic, where the sole operation is modulo-2 addition, to divide D by G. (also known as XOR). The split would take place in this scenario as follows: D: 1010101010\sG: 10011 01010\s 1 0011 ————-\s 1001\s 0 0101 ————\s 0001 1001\s ————\s 0000 This division's remaining value is 0000, which serves as the CRC for the supplied data D and generator G.
