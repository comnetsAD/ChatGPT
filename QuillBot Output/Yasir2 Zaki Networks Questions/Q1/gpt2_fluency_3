The CRC value for the supplied generator and data value is 011. To compute the CRC, we must first pad the data value with zeros until it matches the length of the generator. The padded data value in this example is 10101010100000. The padded data value is then divided by the generator using modulo-2 division. The CRC makes up the rest of this division. When we divide by modulo-2, we get: 10101010100000\s10011\s10011\s100110\s00000\s10011\s011 The remainder of the division is 011, which is the CRC value.
