011 is the CRC value for the specified generator and data value. To compute the CRC, the data value must be padded with zeros until it has the same length as the generator. The padded data value in this instance is 10101010100000. Next, we use modulo-2 division to divide the padded data value by the generator. The remaining portion of this section is the CRC. Using modulo-2 division, we get: 10101010100000\s10011\s10011\s100110\s00000\s10011\s011 The remainder of the division is 011, representing the CRC's value.
