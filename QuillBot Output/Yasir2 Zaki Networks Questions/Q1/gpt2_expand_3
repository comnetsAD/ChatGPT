011 is the value that should be used for the CRC based on the provided generator and data value. Before we can compute the CRC, we first need to make sure that the data value is the same length as the generator by padding it with zeros until it is the same length. In this particular instance, the value of the padded data is 10101010100000. The next step involves utilizing modulo-2 division to divide the padded data value by the generator. The CRC is comprised of the remaining portions of this division. Using modulo-2 division, we get: 10101010100000\s10011\s10011\s100110\s00000\s10011\s011 011 is the remainder of the division, which is the same as the value of the CRC.
