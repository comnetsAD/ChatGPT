A NAK-only protocol, which employs only negative acknowledgments (NAKs) to indicate the receipt of data, may be preferable than an ACK-only protocol under some circumstances. If the sender delivers data rarely, a NAK-only protocol may be preferred since it allows the receiver to request retransmission of data as required, as opposed to forcing the sender to continually send ACKs for each item of data received. This may assist to decrease the protocol's overhead and increase its efficiency. A NAK-only protocol may not be optimal if the sender has a large amount of data to communicate and the end-to-end connection has minimal losses. In this situation, the sender would be required to repeatedly transmit NAKs to seek retransmission of lost data, which might result in higher overhead and decreased efficiency compared to a protocol that employs ACKs. In a protocol that employs acknowledgements (ACKs), the sender may simply transmit the data and wait for an ACK from the receiver to signal that the data was properly received. This may be more effective than transmitting NAKs continually in a NAK-only protocol. Whether a NAK-only protocol or a protocol that employs ACKs is preferred depends on the specifics of the data transmission, such as the data transfer rate, the quantity of data being sent, and the dependability of the end-to-end connection.
