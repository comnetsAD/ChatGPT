Negative acknowledgments (NAKs) are sometimes preferred over positive acknowledgments (ACKs) for determining whether or not data has been successfully received by a receiving node. As the sender is not required to submit ACKs for every single item of data received, a NAK-only protocol may be advantageous if the sender seldom transmits data. This has the potential to reduce the protocol's overhead and boost its efficiency. It's possible that a NAK-only protocol isn't the best option if the sender has a large amount of data to communicate and the end-to-end connection suffers minimal losses. To seek retransmission of missing data, the sender would have to repeatedly transmit NAKs, which might increase overhead and decrease performance when compared to an ACK-based protocol. In an ACK-based protocol, the sender need just transmit the data and then wait for the receiver to acknowledge its receipt. In a NAK-only protocol, this may be more efficient than sending NAKs repeatedly. To summarize, the transfer rate, the quantity of data being transferred, and the dependability of the end-to-end connection all play a role in determining whether a NAK-only protocol or one that employs ACKs is desirable.
