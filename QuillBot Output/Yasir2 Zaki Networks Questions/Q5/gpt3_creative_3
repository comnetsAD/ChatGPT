The specifics of the data transmission will determine whether a NAK-only protocol or an ACK-using approach is preferred. A NAK-only protocol may be more appropriate than one that makes use of ACKs if the sender provides data rarely. Since NAKs are only sent in reaction to lost or corrupted packets, the sender will have fewer possibilities for packet loss or corruption if it sends data rarely. As a consequence, the protocol's overhead may be lowered due to a decrease in the number of NAKs being transmitted. However, a NAK-only protocol may not be superior to one that requires ACKs if the sender has a large amount of data to convey and the end-to-end connection has minimal losses. This is due to the fact that with a NAK-only protocol, the sender will not have definitive proof that a packet has been received until a NAK is received for a succeeding packet. This may be wasteful since it allows the sender to transmit all of their data without obtaining confirmation that it was successfully delivered, even if the connection is very reliable. In cases when there are few losses and the sender is delivering data rarely, a NAK-only protocol may be preferred, whereas a protocol that employs ACKs may be preferred when there is a significant volume of data to be transferred over a somewhat steady connection.
