In certain scenarios, the usage of ACKs may be desirable, but in others, a NAK-only protocol, which employs only negative acknowledgments (NAKs) to signify the receipt of data, may be preferred. A NAK-only protocol may be preferred if the sender delivers data rarely, since it may assist to decrease the protocol's overhead. If the protocol relies on ACKs, the sender can't transmit any further information until the receiver acknowledges receipt of the previous packet. Especially if the sender is providing data rarely, this might cause transmission delays. The sender in a NAK-only protocol does not need to wait for an ACK from the receiver before delivering more data. Instead, if the transmitter gets a NAK from the receiver indicating that a packet was lost, it may continue delivering data until the NAK is received. If the sender is delivering data rarely, this may assist to decrease delays in transmission. However, a NAK-only protocol may not be optimal if the sender has a large amount of data to communicate and the end-to-end link encounters minimal losses. It may be more efficient for the sender to utilize ACKs to acknowledge the receipt of data rather than wait for a NAK if the sender is transmitting data at a rapid pace. Throughput of a protocol may be improved by allowing the sender to transmit additional packets before waiting for an ACK. A NAK-only protocol might cause delays and lower throughput since the sender must wait for a NAK before transmitting additional data. Therefore, the sender's data transfer rate and the end-to-end connection's packet loss rate determine whether a NAK-only protocol is preferred over one that utilizes ACKs. A NAK-only protocol may be more efficient in certain scenarios, while an ACK-based protocol may be more efficient in others.
