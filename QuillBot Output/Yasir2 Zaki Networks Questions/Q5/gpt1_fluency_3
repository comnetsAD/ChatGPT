In certain instances, a NAK-only protocol that employs only negative acknowledgments (NAKs) to signify data reception may be preferable to a system that uses positive acknowledgments (ACKs). If the sender only delivers data rarely, a NAK-only protocol may be better since it enables the receiver to request data retransmission as required rather than forcing the sender to give ACKs for each item of data received. This may assist to decrease the protocol's overhead and increase its efficiency. A NAK-only protocol, on the other hand, may not be preferred if the sender has a large amount of data to transfer and the end-to-end link encounters minimal losses. In this situation, the sender would have to send NAKs indefinitely to seek retransmission of lost data, which might result in higher overhead and decreased efficiency as compared to a protocol that employs ACKs. In an ACK-based protocol, the sender may simply transmit the data and wait for an ACK from the receiver to signal that the data was properly received. This may be more efficient than transmitting NAKs continually in a NAK-only protocol. Overall, whether a NAK-only protocol or an ACK-based protocol is better will depend on the specifics of the data transmission, such as the pace at which data is transferred, the quantity of data sent, and the dependability of the end-to-end connection.
