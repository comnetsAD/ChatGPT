In certain instances, a NAK-only protocol may be better than an ACK-only protocol. NAK-only protocols may minimize protocol overhead for infrequent senders. The sender must wait for an ACK from the receiver before transmitting further data in an ACK protocol. If the sender sends data rarely, this might delay transmission. In a NAK-only protocol, the sender may deliver data without waiting for an ACK. The sender may keep providing data until the recipient sends a NAK, signaling a packet was lost. This may minimize data transmission delays, especially for infrequent senders. A NAK-only protocol may not be best if the sender has a lot of data and the end-to-end connection has minimal losses. ACKs may be more efficient than NAKs if the sender is transmitting data at a high pace. In a protocol that employs ACKs, the sender may transmit many packets before waiting for an ACK, increasing protocol throughput. The sender must wait for a NAK before transmitting additional data in a NAK-only protocol, which might slow it down. Thus, whether a NAK-only protocol is better than an ACK-based protocol relies on the sender's data rate and the end-to-end connection's packet loss. In certain instances, a NAK-only protocol is more efficient than an ACK-only protocol.
