Depending on the details of the data transmission, a NAK-only protocol may be preferred to a system that employs ACKs. A NAK-only protocol may be preferable than an ACK-using protocol if the sender transmits data seldom. This is due to the fact that NAKs are only ever delivered in response to packets that have been lost or damaged, and since the sender is transmitting data rarely, there will be less of a chance for packets to be lost or damaged. As a consequence, there will be fewer NAKs transmitted, which may aid in lowering the protocol's overhead. On the other hand, a NAK-only protocol may not be preferred to a system that employs ACKs if the sender has a lot of data to communicate and the end-to-end connection encounters minimal losses. This is so that the sender may wait until a NAK is received for a later packet before receiving any positive confirmation that a packet has been received in a NAK-only protocol. This might result in a significant quantity of data being transmitted without getting any affirmative confirmation, which can be wasteful if the sender has a lot of data to send and the connection is generally reliable. A protocol that employs ACKs may be preferred in circumstances where there is a lot of data to be transmitted and the connection is quite stable, while a NAK-only approach may be preferable in circumstances when there are few losses and the sender is sending data rarely.
