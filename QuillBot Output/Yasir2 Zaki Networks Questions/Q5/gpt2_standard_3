In certain circumstances, a protocol that employs ACKs but not in others may be better than a system that uses just negative acknowledgments (NAKs) to signify the receipt of data. A NAK-only protocol may be preferred if the sender provides data rarely since it may assist to lower the protocol's overhead. In a protocol that makes use of ACKs, the sender must hold off on transmitting more data until the receiver has sent an ACK. Data transmission delays may result from this, especially if the sender sends data rarely. A NAK-only protocol does not need the sender to wait for the recipient to respond with an ACK before delivering more data. Instead, the sender may just keep delivering data up until the recipient responds with a NAK, letting them know that a packet was lost. Data transmission delays may be reduced as a result, especially if the sender sends data rarely. On the other hand, a NAK-only protocol may not be the best choice if the sender has a lot of data to transfer and the end-to-end connection has minimal losses. It may be more effective to utilize ACKs in this situation than than waiting for a NAK since the sender may be transmitting data at a rapid pace. In a protocol that makes use of ACKs, the sender may transmit a number of packets before waiting for an ACK, which can aid in boosting the protocol's total throughput. A NAK-only protocol forces the sender to wait for a NAK before transmitting any more data, which may cause delays and lower the protocol's total throughput. The pace at which the sender is delivering data and the rate of packet loss in the end-to-end connection determine whether a NAK-only protocol is preferable to one that utilizes ACKs. A protocol that employs solely NAKs could be more effective in certain circumstances, while a protocol that uses ACKs might be more effective in others.
