Whether a NAK-only protocol is better than an ACK-based approach depends on the specifics of the data transmission. If the sender only provides data rarely, a NAK-only protocol may be preferable than an ACK-based approach. This is due to the fact that NAKs are only transmitted in reaction to lost or damaged packets, and since the sender sends data rarely, there are fewer possibilities for packets to be lost or damaged. As a consequence, fewer NAKs will be transmitted, which may assist to minimize the protocol's overhead. However, if the sender has a large amount of data to communicate and the end-to-end connection has minimal losses, a NAK-only protocol may not be preferred to an ACK-based protocol. This is due to the fact that with a NAK-only protocol, the sender does not get any affirmative confirmation that a packet has been received until a NAK for a later packet is received. If the sender has a significant quantity of data to transmit and the connection is somewhat steady, a huge amount of data may be transferred without getting any affirmative confirmation, which may be wasteful. In general, a NAK-only protocol may be preferred when there are few losses and the sender sends data rarely, while an ACK-based approach may be preferable when there is a big volume of data to be transmitted and the connection is reasonably steady.
