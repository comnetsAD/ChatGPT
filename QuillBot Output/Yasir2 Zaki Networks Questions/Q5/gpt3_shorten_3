Whether a NAK-only protocol is better than an ACK-based protocol depends on the data transmission. NAK-only protocols may be better for infrequent senders. Since the sender sends data rarely, NAKs are only transmitted in reaction to lost or damaged packets. Thus, fewer NAKs are transmitted, reducing protocol overhead. However, if the sender has a lot of data and the end-to-end connection has minimal losses, a NAK-only protocol may not be better than an ACK protocol. In a NAK-only protocol, the sender doesn't know whether a packet was received until a later NAK is received. If the sender has a lot of data to transmit and the connection is steady, the data may be transferred without confirmation, which is wasteful. In general, a NAK-only protocol is better when there are few losses and the sender sends data rarely, whereas an ACK-based protocol is better when there is a lot of data to transmit and the connection is reliable.
