In certain instances, a NAK-only protocol that utilizes only negative acknowledgments (NAKs) to signify data reception may be preferable than a system that employs ACKs in others. If the sender only delivers data rarely, a NAK-only protocol may be preferred since it may assist to decrease protocol overhead. In an ACK-based protocol, the sender must wait for an ACK from the receiver before delivering more data. This may cause data transmission delays, especially if the sender sends data rarely. The sender does not need to wait for an ACK from the receiver before delivering new data in a NAK-only protocol. Instead, the sender might just keep delivering data until the receiver responds with a NAK, indicating that a packet was lost. This may assist to decrease data transmission delays, especially if the sender sends data rarely. A NAK-only protocol, on the other hand, may not be preferred if the sender has a large amount of data to transfer and the end-to-end link encounters minimal losses. In this situation, the sender may be transmitting data at a rapid pace, therefore using ACKs to acknowledge data receipt rather than waiting for a NAK may be more efficient. In an ACK-based protocol, the sender may transmit many packets before waiting for an ACK, which can assist to boost the protocol's total throughput. In a NAK-only protocol, the sender must wait for a NAK before transmitting additional data, which may cause delays and limit the protocol's total throughput. As a result, whether a NAK-only protocol is preferable to an ACK-based protocol relies on the sender's data throughput and the amount of packet loss in the end-to-end connection. In certain circumstances, a NAK-only protocol may be more efficient, but in others, an ACK-based protocol may be more efficient.
