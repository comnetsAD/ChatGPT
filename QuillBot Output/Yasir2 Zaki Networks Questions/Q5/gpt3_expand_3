It is dependent on the particulars of the data transmission as to whether or not a protocol that just employs NAKs is better to one that also makes use of ACKs. If the sender only delivers data sometimes, it is possible that a protocol that solely employs NAKs is preferable than one that also uses ACKs. The reason for this is because NAKs are only sent in reaction to lost or damaged packets, and since the sender is delivering data rarely, there will be less possibilities for packets to be lost or damaged. This is because NAKs are only sent in response to lost or damaged packets. As a consequence of this change, there will be a reduction in the number of NAKs that are sent, which will assist to bring the protocol's overhead down. A NAK-only protocol, on the other hand, may not be preferred to an ACK-based protocol in situations when the sender has a large amount of data to transmit and if the end-to-end connection encounters a low number of packet losses. This is due to the fact that in a protocol that only uses NAKs, the sender does not get any affirmative confirmation that a packet has been received until a NAK is received for a later packet. This is the case because of the NAK-only protocol. If the connection is very steady and the sender has a lot of data to transmit, this might result in a huge quantity of data being transferred without the sender getting any affirmative confirmation, which can be wasteful. In general, it is possible that it would be preferable to use a NAK-only protocol in circumstances in which there are few data losses and the sender is sending data infrequently. On the other hand, it is possible that it would be preferable to use a protocol that uses ACKs in circumstances in which there is a large amount of data to be sent and the connection is relatively stable.
