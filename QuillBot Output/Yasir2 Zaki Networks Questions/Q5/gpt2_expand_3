A protocol that employs only negative acknowledgments (NAKs) to signify the receipt of data may be preferred over a system that sometimes makes use of positive acknowledgments (ACKs), but not always. Such a protocol is known as a NAK-only protocol. If the sender only delivers data occasionally, it may be more beneficial to utilize a NAK-only protocol since this kind of protocol helps to decrease the amount of "overhead" that is associated with using the protocol. Before transmitting any more data, the sender in a protocol that makes use of ACKs is required to wait for an ACK from the receiver. Because of this, there is a possibility that the data you are trying to communicate may be delayed, which is especially likely if the sender sends data only occasionally. In a protocol that solely uses NAKs, the sender is not required to hold off on transmitting more data until the receiver has acknowledged receipt of the previous data by providing an ACK. Instead, the sender may continue delivering data until it gets a NAK from the receiver, which indicates that a packet was lost. If it does receive a NAK, then it knows that a packet was lost. This may assist to minimize the amount of time it takes for data to be sent, which is especially helpful if the sender sends data only seldom. On the other hand, a NAK-only protocol may not be the best choice if the sender has a substantial amount of data to transmit but the end-to-end link suffers from just a few packet losses. In this scenario, the sender may be transmitting data at a high pace, and it may be more time and resource efficient to acknowledge the receipt of data by using ACKs rather than waiting for a NAK. When a protocol makes use of ACKs, the sender is allowed to transmit numerous packets before having to wait for an ACK, which may contribute to an improvement in the protocol's total throughput. When using a protocol that solely uses NAKs, the sender is required to wait for a NAK before transmitting any more data. This requirement might cause delays and lowers the overall throughput of the protocol. Therefore, the pace at which the sender is transmitting data as well as the rate of packet loss in the end-to-end connection are two factors that determine whether a protocol that employs solely NAKs is preferable to a system that includes ACKs. A protocol that exclusively employs NAKs may be more efficient in some circumstances, but a protocol that makes use of ACKs may be more efficient in other circumstances.
