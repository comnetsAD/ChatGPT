In certain situations, a protocol that employs positive acknowledgments (ACKs) may be preferred than one that uses just negative acknowledgments (NAKs), which are used to signify the receipt of data. A NAK-only protocol may be desirable if the sender delivers data only occasionally because it enables the receiver to request retransmission of data as necessary rather than forcing the sender to issue ACKs continually for each item of data received. By doing so, the protocol's overhead may be decreased and its effectiveness increased. A NAK-only protocol may not be the best choice, however, if the sender has a lot of data to convey and the end-to-end connection encounters minimal losses. This might result in additional overhead and decreased efficiency compared to a protocol that employs ACKs since the sender would have to send NAKs repeatedly to seek retransmission of lost data. In a protocol that makes use of ACKs, the sender just has to provide the data and wait for a response from the recipient to verify that it was properly received. This may be more effective than using a protocol that only sends NAKs when necessary. In general, the choice between a NAK-only protocol and one that employs ACKs will be based on the particulars of the data transfer, such as the pace at which data is transferred, the volume of data being received, and the dependability of the end-to-end connection.
