Whether a NAK-only protocol is superior than an ACK-based approach depends on the specifics of the data transmission. If the sender provides data rarely, a protocol that employs solely NAKs may be preferred over one that requires ACKs. NAKs are only transmitted in reaction to lost or damaged packets, and since the sender is delivering data rarely, there are less possibilities for packets to be lost or damaged. As a consequence, fewer NAKs will be sent, which may assist to lower the protocol's overhead. Alternatively, a NAK-only protocol may not be preferred to an ACK-based protocol if the sender has a large amount of data to communicate and the end-to-end connection encounters minimal losses. In a NAK-only protocol, the sender does not obtain affirmative confirmation that a packet has been received until a NAK for a later packet is received. If the sender has a significant quantity of data to transmit and the connection is very steady, a huge amount of data may be transferred without any confirmation, which may be wasteful. In general, a NAK-only protocol may be preferred when there are minimal data losses and the sender sends data rarely, while a protocol that employs ACKs may be preferred when there is a great volume of data to be transmitted and the connection is steady.
