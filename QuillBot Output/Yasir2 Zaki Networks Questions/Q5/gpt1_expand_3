A protocol that employs only negative acknowledgments (NAKs) to signify the receipt of data may in certain circumstances be preferred over a system that makes use of positive acknowledgments (ACKs). A NAK-only protocol is an example of such a protocol. Instead of requiring the sender to continuously send ACKs for each new piece of data received, a NAK-only protocol may be preferable in situations where the sender does not frequently send data. This is because the NAK-only protocol enables the receiver to request retransmission of data whenever it is required, whereas an ACK-only protocol does not. This may assist to lower the protocol's overhead, which in turn may help to enhance the efficiency of the protocol. On the other hand, a NAK-only protocol may not be the best choice if the sender has a significant amount of data to transmit but the end-to-end link suffers very few losses. In this scenario, the sender would need to continually transmit NAKs in order to seek retransmission of lost data. This might lead to greater overhead and lower efficiency when compared to a protocol that employs ACKs, since the NAKs would need to be sent repeatedly. The transmitter of data in a protocol that employs ACKs should only deliver the data and then wait for an ACK from the receiver to certify that the data was successfully received before continuing with the protocol. When compared to continually transmitting NAKs in a protocol that only supports NAKs, this approach may be more efficient. The specifics of the data transfer, such as the rate at which data is being sent, the amount of data that is being sent, and the dependability of the connection from one endpoint to the other, will determine, in the grand scheme of things, whether a protocol that uses only NAKs or a protocol that uses ACKs is preferable.
