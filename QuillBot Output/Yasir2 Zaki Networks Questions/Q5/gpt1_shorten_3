A NAK-only protocol, which employs only negative acknowledgments (NAKs) to indicate data reception, may be better than an ACK-only protocol. If the sender provides data rarely, a NAK-only protocol may be better since it enables the receiver to request retransmission rather than forcing the sender to continually send ACKs. This reduces protocol overhead and improves efficiency. If the sender has a lot of data and the end-to-end connection has minimal losses, a NAK-only protocol may not be best. In this instance, the sender would need to repeatedly send NAKs to seek retransmission of missing data, which might increase overhead and degrade efficiency compared to ACKs. The sender may simply transmit the data and wait for an ACK from the receiver to certify that it was received. In a NAK-only protocol, transmitting NAKs repeatedly is inefficient. The pace, volume, and dependability of the end-to-end connection will determine whether a NAK-only protocol or one that utilizes ACKs is better for data transmission.
