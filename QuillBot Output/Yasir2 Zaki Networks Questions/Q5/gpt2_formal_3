A NAK-only protocol, which utilizes only negative acknowledgments (NAKs) to signify the receipt of data, may be better to a protocol that employs ACKs in some circumstances, but not in others. If the sender transmits data rarely, a NAK-only protocol may be preferred since it reduces the protocol's overhead. Before transmitting more data in a protocol that employs ACKs, the sender must wait for an ACK from the receiver. This might result in data transmission delays, especially if the sender sends data rarely. In a NAK-only protocol, the sender is not required to wait for the receiver's ACK before transmitting more data. Instead, the sender might continue to transmit data until it gets a NAK from the recipient, which indicates that a packet was lost. This may minimize transmission delays, especially if the sender transmits data rarely. A NAK-only protocol may not be preferred if the sender has a large amount of data to communicate and the end-to-end connection has minimal losses. In this scenario, the sender may be transmitting data at a rapid pace, and it may be more efficient to utilize ACKs to acknowledge the receipt of data instead of waiting for a NAK. In a system that employs ACKs, the sender may transmit numerous packets before waiting for an ACK, which can boost the protocol's total throughput. In a NAK-only protocol, the sender must wait for a NAK before transmitting more data, which may cause delays and decrease the protocol's total throughput. Therefore, whether a NAK-only protocol is better to an ACK-based protocol relies on the sender's data transmission rate and the packet loss rate in the end-to-end connection. In certain situations, a NAK-only protocol may be more efficient, but in others, an ACK-based protocol may be more effective.
