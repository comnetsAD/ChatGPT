Bob is mistaken if he thinks he can get a full copy of the file the swarm is sharing without contributing any data himself. This is due to the fact that BitTorrent is a decentralized file sharing technology that requires users to work together to transfer files. One must post data to other peers in the swarm before they may retrieve data from the swarm. Without making any data contributions, peers like Bob will not get any information from the swarm. This is due to the fact that peers with active uploads will have their data uploaded more often than peers with no uploads, resulting in a more efficient swarm overall. But Bob may "free-ride" more effectively by utilizing many computers in the lab, each with its own unique IP address. This is because Bob may download data from several different computers at once, each of which has its own unique IP address and can thus join to the swarm as a peer. Because of this, Bob may now download data from many different sources simultaneously, which might significantly boost his download speed. It should be noted, however, that utilizing several computers in this fashion is not always ethical, because it enables Bob to receive data from the swarm without adding to the swarm's upload capacity. Since some peers may be uploading more data than others, this might cause an imbalance in the swarm. A negative effect on the swarm's productivity might result, and some members of the swarm could see this as unjust.
