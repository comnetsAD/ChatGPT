Bob believes that he can increase the efficiency of his "free-riding" by employing a collection of many machines (with unique IP addresses) in the department's computer lab. How is it possible? Bob may be able to obtain a full copy of the file shared by the swarm without transferring any data to other peers, but it is improbable. Peers may take data from other peers in a BitTorrent swarm, but they are required to send data in exchange. This guarantees that data is spread equitably across peers and prevents network congestion. If Bob does not want to upload any data to other peers in the swarm, he is effectively freeloading off the other peers. This might generate an unequal distribution of data within the swarm and network congestion, since some peers may not get the data they need to continue downloading. Moreover, some BitTorrent clients have techniques to discourage free-riding, such as requiring a minimum quantity of data to be transferred prior to permitting a peer to download. This might make it challenging for Bob to get a full copy of the file without posting any data to other peers. Regarding Bob's assertion that he can utilize numerous computers to increase the efficiency of his free-riding, this is not a smart idea. Using numerous computers with unique IP addresses to free-ride in a BitTorrent swarm is immoral and is often referred to as "IP spoofing." It may result in a negative user experience for other members of the swarm and is deemed abusive. In general, it is not advised to indulge in this conduct.
