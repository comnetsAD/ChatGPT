Bob maintains that he can "free-ride" more effectively by making use of the department's computer lab, which has a number of PCs (all with separate IP addresses). And how does he even manage to achieve that? Theoretically, Bob might get a full copy of the file the swarm is sharing without contributing anything to the network, but in practice, this is very improbable. It is assumed that peers would upload data to other peers in a BitTorrent swarm in exchange for peers downloading data from them. Having the data spread out equally across the peers helps keep the network from being bogged down. Since Bob is not contributing anything to the swarm by way of data uploads, he is effectively just using the resources of the other peers for free. This might generate bottlenecks in the network when some peers are prevented from downloading because they aren't getting the data they require from other peers. In addition, many BitTorrent clients have safeguards in place to avoid freeloading, such as a threshold of uploaded data before a peer is granted access to a download. It might be challenging for Bob to get a full copy of the file without transferring any data to other peers if this happens. Bob's suggestion that using additional machines would make his freeloading more effective is not sound advice. "IP spoofing" refers to the illicit practice of using numerous computers with different IP addresses to participate in a single BitTorrent swarm without paying for the privilege. It's a sort of abuse that may ruin the experience for everyone else in the swarm. This is not a practice that is encouraged.
