Bob is mistaken if he thinks he can get a full copy of the file the swarm is sharing without contributing any data himself. For the BitTorrent protocol to work, every peer in the swarm must do their part to ensure the file is widely disseminated by uploading their own copy to the network. Bob will not be able to download the whole file if he does not participate in the distribution process by sharing his own data with his peers. If Bob isn't sharing his data with his peers, then no one will feel compelled to share theirs with him. If Bob is able to establish connections with enough seeds or high-bandwidth peers, he may be able to get a partial copy of the file. But this will be time-consuming and may not produce an accurate duplicate of the file. Bob may increase the speed of his "free-riding" by using many computers by installing a BitTorrent client on each one and then linking them all to the same torrent. If he could download from many different sources at once, he could theoretically increase his download rate. This, however, is against the terms of service of both the BitTorrent client and the torrent tracker, and is thus unethical.
