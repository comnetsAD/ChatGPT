Bob cannot obtain a full copy of the swarm's file without publishing data to other peers. BitTorrent, a peer-to-peer file sharing technology, uses shared responsibilities for uploading and downloading data. Downloading data from the swarm requires posting data to other peers. Bob won't get data from the swarm if he doesn't post data. Because other peers in the swarm will prefer uploading data to peers that are also uploading data over peers who are not. Bob may improve his "free-riding" by utilizing various computer labs with different IP addresses. Bob may download data from several peers since each machine with a unique IP address can join to the swarm as a peer. Bob may download numerous sources at once, which may speed up his downloads. However, having numerous computers enables Bob to take data from the swarm without contributing to its upload capacity, which may be unethical. This might cause a swarm imbalance where some peers upload more data than others. This may decrease swarm performance and be unfair to other members.
