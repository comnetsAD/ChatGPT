It is not feasible for Bob to obtain a full copy of the file shared by the swarm without uploading any data to other peers. This is due to the BitTorrent protocol's shared responsibility mechanism, in which each peer in the swarm is required to contribute to the file's dissemination by uploading data to other peers. If Bob does not participate to the file's distribution, he will not get data from other peers and will be unable to download the whole file. This is due to the fact that other peers will be unmotivated to upload data to Bob if he is not uploading data to them. However, if Bob is able to connect to enough seeds or high-bandwidth peers who can give him with the data he needs, he may be able to acquire a partial copy of the file. However, this is inefficient and may result in a partial copy of the file. If Bob wishes to utilize many computers with different IP addresses to increase the efficiency of his "free-riding," he may do so by installing a BitTorrent client on each of them and connecting them to the same torrent. This would enable him to concurrently download material from various sources, possibly improving his download speed. However, this is considered unethical and may violate the BitTorrent client's and torrent tracker's terms of service.
