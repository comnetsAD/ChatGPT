Bob says he can improve his "free-riding" by utilizing the department's computer lab's many IP-addressed PCs. How? Bob can acquire a full copy of the swarm's file without submitting any data, but it's improbable. In a BitTorrent swarm, peers may receive data but must also submit data. This distributes data equitably across peers and prevents network congestion. Bob is freeloading on the swarm if he doesn't upload data. This might cause the swarm to distribute data unevenly and congest the network since other peers may not get the data they need to download. Many BitTorrent clients also require a minimum upload quantity before enabling a peer to download. Bob may not obtain a full copy of the file without submitting data to peers. Bob's proposal to utilize numerous computers to free-ride more efficiently is bad. "IP spoofing"—using numerous computers with different IP addresses to free-ride in a BitTorrent swarm—is immoral. It may mistreat other swarm members and ruin their experience. This is not advised.
