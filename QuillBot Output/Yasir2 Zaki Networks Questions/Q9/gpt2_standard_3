It is not feasible for Bob to get a whole copy of the file shared by the swarm without sending any data to other peers, despite what he claims. Because each peer in the swarm is required to contribute to the spread of the file by uploading data to other peers, the BitTorrent protocol depends on a concept of shared responsibility. Bob won't get data from other peers or be able to download the whole file if he doesn't participate to the file's distribution. This is because if Bob isn't uploading data to them, other peers won't be encouraged to submit data to him. However, if Bob is able to connect to enough seeds or high-bandwidth peers that can provide him the information he needs, he may be able to get a portion of the file. However, this won't be effective, and a full duplicate of the file may not be produced. Running a BitTorrent client on each machine and connecting them to the same torrent would allow Bob to more effectively "free-ride" by using many computers with different IP addresses. He would be able to download information concurrently from many sources, perhaps accelerating his download speed. However, this is seen as immoral and can be against the BitTorrent client's and the torrent tracker's terms of service.
