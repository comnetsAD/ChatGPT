It is not feasible for Bob to obtain a full copy of the file shared by the swarm without uploading any data to other peers. This is due to the fact that BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer file sharing technology that depends on a shared responsibility scheme for uploading and downloading data. To consume data from the swarm, a peer must also contribute to the swarm by uploading data to other peers. If a peer, such as Bob, does not participate to the swarm by uploading data, the swarm will not return data to him. This is due to the fact that other peers in the swarm will prioritize uploading data to peers who are also uploading data over peers who are not participating to the swarm. Bob, on the other hand, may make his "free-riding" more efficient by utilizing many machines in the computer lab with separate IP addresses. This is due to the fact that any computer with a unique IP address may join to the swarm as a different peer, enabling Bob to download data from numerous peers at the same time. This has the ability to boost Bob's download speed since he can download data from numerous sources at the same time. However, it is worth mentioning that utilizing many computers in this manner is not always ethical, since it enables Bob to take data from the swarm while not contributing to the swarm's upload capacity. This has the potential to create a swarm imbalance in which certain peers upload a disproportionate quantity of data relative to others. This may have a detrimental influence on the swarm's overall performance and may be viewed unfair by other peers in the swarm.
