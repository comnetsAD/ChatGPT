Bob further asserts that he is able to make his "free-riding" even more productive by using the collection of many machines (each of which has a unique IP address) that are located in the computer lab that is located in his department. How is it that he can accomplish it? It is theoretically conceivable for Bob to get a full copy of the file that is being shared by the swarm without having to upload any data to the other peers in the network; however, it is very improbable that this will actually occur. Peers in a BitTorrent swarm are able to download data from the other peers in the swarm; however, they are also required to upload data to the other peers in the swarm in exchange for the data that they receive. This helps to keep the network from being overcrowded by ensuring that the data is dispersed equally among all of the peers and also ensures that the data is distributed fairly. If Bob does not intend to share any data with the other peers in the swarm, this amounts to him effectively taking advantage of the generosity of those peers. This may result in an unequal distribution of data within the swarm, which in turn may cause the network to become congested since some peers may not get the data they need to continue downloading files. Additionally, many BitTorrent clients have techniques to discourage free-riding, such as requiring a minimum quantity of data to be uploaded before enabling a peer to receive the file. This is one example of how these features might be used. Because of this, it could be difficult for Bob to get a whole copy of the file without having to upload any data to the other peers in the network. Regarding Bob's assertion that he may improve the effectiveness of his free-riding activities by using many computers, this is not a sound plan. It is deemed immoral to use numerous computers, each of which has a unique IP address, in order to free-ride in a BitTorrent swarm. This practice is sometimes referred to as "IP spoofing." It is possible that other users of the swarm may have a negative experience as a result, and this behavior may be deemed abusive. In most cases, engaging in this kind of activity is not something that should be encouraged.
