It is impossible for Bob to acquire a full copy of the file shared by the swarm without transferring any data to other peers. Each peer in the swarm is required to contribute to the dissemination of the file by uploading data to other peers, since the BitTorrent protocol depends on a system of shared responsibility. If Bob does not participate to the file's distribution, he will not get data from his peers and will be unable to download the whole file. This is because Bob's peers will not upload data to him if he does not upload data to them. Bob may be able to get a partial copy of the file, however, if he is able to connect to enough seeds or high-bandwidth peers that can give him with the necessary data. This is inefficient and may not provide a full duplicate of the file. Bob might utilize many computers with various IP addresses to increase the efficiency of his "free-riding" by installing a BitTorrent client on each machine and connecting them to the same torrent. This would enable him to download material from numerous sources concurrently, hence possibly improving his download speed. This is nonetheless immoral and may violate the terms of service of the BitTorrent software and the torrent tracker.
