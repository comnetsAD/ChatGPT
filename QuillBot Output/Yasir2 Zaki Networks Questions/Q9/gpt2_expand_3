It is not feasible for Bob to fulfill his claim that he may obtain a whole copy of the file that is being shared by the swarm without first uploading any data to the other peers. As a result of this, each peer in the swarm is required to contribute to the distribution of the file by uploading data to other peers. This is because the BitTorrent protocol is based on a system of shared responsibility, which requires all peers to take part in the system. If Bob does not participate to the file's distribution, he will not be able to get data from his other peers, nor will he be able to download the whole file. This is due to the fact that Bob's peers will not be encouraged to upload data to him if he is not motivating them to post data to him. On the other hand, if Bob is able to connect to a sufficient number of seeds or high-bandwidth peers that are in a position to provide him the information he needs, he could be able to get a copy of the file that is only partially complete. However, this will be time-consuming, and it is possible that the file will not be copied in its whole. If Bob wants to make his "free-riding" more efficient, he may do so by installing a BitTorrent client on each of his computers and then connecting all of those machines to the same torrent. This will allow Bob to utilize numerous computers, each of which will have a unique IP address. Because of this, he would be able to download data from a number of different sources all at once, which might significantly increase the download speed. On the other hand, this behavior is seen as immoral, and it may violate the terms of service of both the BitTorrent client and the torrent tracker.
