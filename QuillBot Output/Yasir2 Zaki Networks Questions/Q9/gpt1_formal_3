It is impossible for Bob to acquire a full copy of the file shared by the swarm without transferring any data to other peers. BitTorrent is a protocol for peer-to-peer file sharing that depends on a system of shared responsibility for uploading and downloading data. A peer must contribute to the swarm by uploading data to other peers in order to access the swarm's data. If a peer, such as Bob, does not upload data to the swarm, it will not get data from the swarm in return. This is because other peers in the swarm will prioritize uploading data to peers who are also participating to the swarm, as opposed to peers that are not contributing. However, Bob may increase the efficiency of his "free-riding" by using many machines with unique IP addresses in the computer lab. This is due to the fact that any computer with a unique IP address may join to the swarm as a different peer, enabling Bob to concurrently download data from numerous peers. This has the potential to boost Bob's download speed, since he can now download data from numerous sources simultaneously. It should be noted, however, that utilizing several computers in this manner is not always ethical, since it enables Bob to take data from the swarm without contributing to the swarm's upload capacity. This may cause an imbalance in the swarm in which some peers upload a disproportionate quantity of data relative to others. This may have a detrimental influence on the overall performance of the swarm and may be seen as unfair by other members.
