It is not feasible for Bob to get a whole copy of the file shared by the swarm without sending any data to other peers, despite what he claims. This is so because BitTorrent depends on a system of shared responsibility for data uploading and downloading since it is a peer-to-peer file sharing protocol. A peer must participate to the swarm by uploading data to other peers in order to be able to retrieve data from the swarm. A peer, like Bob, won't get data from the swarm in exchange if it doesn't contribute to the swarm by uploading data. This is due to the fact that other swarm peers prefer uploading data to peers who are also uploading data above peers who are not assisting the swarm. However, by utilizing many computers in the computer lab with different IP addresses, Bob may increase the effectiveness of his "free-riding." This is so that Bob may download data from several peers at once. This is possible because each machine with a unique IP address can join the swarm as a different peer. As a result of being able to download information from many sources simultaneously, Bob may see an improvement in download speed. It is important to note that this method of leveraging several computers may not be morally acceptable since it enables Bob to download data from the swarm without affecting the swarm's ability to post data. As a result, the swarm may become unbalanced, with some peers uploading disproportionately more data than others. This may be seen as unfair by other peers in the swarm and have a detrimental effect on the swarm's overall performance.
