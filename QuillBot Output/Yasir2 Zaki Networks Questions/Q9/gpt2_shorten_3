Bob cannot obtain a full copy of the swarm's file without publishing data to other peers. The BitTorrent protocol depends on shared responsibility, where each member in the swarm uploads data to other peers to distribute the file. Bob cannot receive data from peers or download the whole file if he does not distribute the file. If Bob doesn't upload data to others, others won't either. If Bob can connect to enough seeds or high-bandwidth peers with the data he needs, he may be able to get a partial copy of the file. This is inefficient and may not copy the file completely. Bob may utilize numerous computers with different IP addresses to "free-ride" more efficiently by launching a BitTorrent client on each and connecting them to the same torrent. He could download data from many sources concurrently, speeding up his downloads. This is unethical and may violate BitTorrent and torrent tracker terms of service.
