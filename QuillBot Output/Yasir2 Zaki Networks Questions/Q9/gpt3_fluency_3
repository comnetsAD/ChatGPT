Bob says that he may increase the efficiency of his "free-riding" by employing a collection of many machines (with separate IP addresses) in his department's computer lab. How is he able to do so? It is conceivable for Bob to obtain an exact duplicate of the file shared by the swarm without posting any data to other peers, although this is uncommon. Peers in a BitTorrent swarm may receive data from other peers in the swarm, but they must also upload data to other peers in the swarm in exchange. This guarantees that data is spread equally across peers and keeps the network from getting overcrowded. If Bob refuses to upload data to other peers, he is effectively freeloading on the other peers in the swarm. This might result in an unequal distribution of data within the swarm and cause the network to become congested since other peers may not get the data they need to continue downloading. Furthermore, many BitTorrent clients have safeguards in place to discourage free-riding, such as requiring a certain quantity of data to be transferred before enabling a peer to download. This might make receiving a full copy of the file without uploading any data to other peers challenging for Bob. Bob's assertion that he can utilize numerous computers to increase the efficiency of his free-riding is a bad notion. Using numerous computers with different IP addresses to free-ride in a BitTorrent swarm is unethical and is known as "IP spoofing." It may result in a bad user experience for other members of the swarm and is considered abuse. It is not typically advised to indulge in this conduct.
