It is not feasible for Bob to fulfill his claim that he may obtain a whole copy of the file that is being shared by the swarm without first uploading any data to the other peers. This is due to the fact that BitTorrent is a protocol for peer-to-peer file sharing that operates on the principle of shared responsibility for the uploading and downloading of data. It is necessary for a peer to contribute to the swarm in the form of data uploads to other peers in order for it to be able to receive data from the swarm. If a peer, such as Bob, does not participate to the swarm by uploading data, then the peer will not get any data in return from the swarm. This is due to the fact that other peers in the swarm will give priority when uploading data to peers that are also uploading data, as opposed to peers who are not participating to the swarm in any way. However, Bob may make his "free-riding" far more productive by making use of many machines in the computer lab, each of which has a unique IP address. This is due to the fact that any computer that has its own unique IP address is able to join to the swarm as a different peer. This gives Bob the ability to download data from a number of peers all at once. Because of this, Bob is now able to download data from numerous sources simultaneously, which has the potential to boost the download speed that he experiences. However, it is important to point out that utilizing many computers in this manner is not always ethical. This is because it enables Bob to receive data from the swarm without contributing to the swarm's upload capacity. Because of this, there is a possibility that the swarm may become unbalanced, with some peers uploading an excessive quantity of data in comparison to others. This may have a detrimental effect on the overall performance of the swarm, and some of the other members of the swarm may see it as unfair.
