Bob goes on to say that by utilizing a number of different machines (each with a different IP address) in his department's computer lab, he may further increase the effectiveness of his "free-riding." Why can't he do that? Without sending any information to other peers, Bob may get a full copy of the file shared by the swarm, although it is doubtful that he will be able to do so. While peers in a BitTorrent swarm may take data from other peers, they are also required to send data to other peers as payment. This helps keep the network from being crowded by ensuring that the data is spread equally across the peers. Bob is effectively freeloading on the other peers in the swarm if he chooses not to upload any data to them. Because other peers could not be getting the data they need to keep downloading, this might result in an unequal distribution of data within the swarm and clog the network. Additionally, a lot of BitTorrent clients have defenses against free-riding, including demanding a certain volume of data to be uploaded first before allowing a peer to download. Due to this, it can be difficult for Bob to download the whole file without sharing any information with other peers. Regarding Bob's assertion that he can utilize many computers to increase the effectiveness of his free-riding, this is not a wise move. It is considered immoral and is sometimes referred to as "IP spoofing" to use numerous computers with different IP addresses to free-ride in a BitTorrent swarm. It might result in a bad user experience for other swarm members and be seen as abuse. Generally speaking, this activity is not advised.
