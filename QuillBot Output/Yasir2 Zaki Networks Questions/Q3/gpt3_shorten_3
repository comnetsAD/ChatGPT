Sending a 5-million-byte MP3 from Host A to Host B requires 3,333 datagrams. Each datagram, including the header, is restricted to 1,500 bytes, while the MP3 is 5 million bytes. First, divide the MP3's 5 million bytes by the maximum datagram size to obtain the number of datagrams needed (1,500 bytes). The MP3 requires 3,333 datagrams. The maximum datagram size includes the 20-byte IP header. The quantity of datagrams would be somewhat larger without the IP header in the maximum size.
