Sending a five-million-byte MP3 file from Host A to Host B requires 3,333 datagrams (5,000,000 / 1,500). This is because the MP3 file is 5 megabytes in size, but each datagram may only contain 1,500 bytes (including the header). First, divide the MP3's size (5,000,000 bytes) by the maximum size of a datagram (1,048,576 bytes) (1,500 bytes). So, the total amount of datagrams needed to transmit the MP3 is 3,333. In this computation, the maximum size of each datagram includes the IP header size (20 bytes). The minimum amount of datagrams would be somewhat larger if the IP header were not counted.
