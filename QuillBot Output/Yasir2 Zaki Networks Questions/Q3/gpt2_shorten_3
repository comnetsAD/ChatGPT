How many datagrams are needed to transport a 5-million-byte MP3 file from Host A to Host B? Datagrams are restricted to 1,500 bytes (including header), while the IP header is 20 bytes, hence the maximum payload size is 1,480 bytes. To determine the number of datagrams needed to transport the 5 million-byte MP3 file, divide the file size by the maximum payload size of each datagram: (5 million bytes) / (1,480 bytes/datagram) = 3,378.378378378378378378378378378 datagrams We must round up since we cannot transmit a portion of a datagram. The 5 million-byte MP3 file requires 3,379 datagrams. We calculated the amount of datagrams needed by dividing the MP3 file size by the maximum payload size of each datagram and rounding up.
