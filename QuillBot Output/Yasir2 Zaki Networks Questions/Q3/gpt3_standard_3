A 5 million byte MP3 would need 3,333 datagrams to be sent from Host A to Host B (5,000,000 / 1,500 = 3,333 datagrams). This is due to the fact that each datagram is restricted to 1,500 bytes, including the header, and the MP3 file is 5 million bytes in total size. Divide the size of the MP3 (5 million bytes) by the maximum size of each datagram to get the number of datagrams needed (1,500 bytes). This tells us that 3,333 datagrams are needed to transfer the MP3 in its entirety. It's vital to remember that this computation takes the IP header's (20 bytes) size into account when determining the maximum size for each datagram. The needed number of datagrams would be significantly larger if the IP header were excluded from the maximum size.
