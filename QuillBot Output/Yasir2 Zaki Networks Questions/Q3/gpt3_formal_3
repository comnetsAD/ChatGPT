Sending a 5-million-byte MP3 file from Host A to Host B would require sending 5,000,000 / 1,500 = 3,333 datagrams. This is due to the fact that each datagram is restricted to 1,500 bytes, including the header, and the MP3 file is 5 million bytes in total size. To determine the needed number of datagrams, we must first divide the MP3's file size (5 million bytes) by the maximum size of a datagram (1,500 bytes). This yields a total of 3,333 datagrams necessary to transmit the MP3 file. Note that this calculation includes the IP header size (20 bytes) when determining the maximum size of each datagram. If the IP header were excluded from the maximum size, the needed number of datagrams would increase somewhat.
