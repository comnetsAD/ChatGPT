We need to determine the number of datagrams needed to deliver a 5 million byte MP3 file from Host A to Host B. The maximum size of the payload in each datagram is 1,500 bytes - 20 bytes = 1,480 bytes since datagrams are only allowed to contain 1,500 bytes (including header) and the IP header is 20 bytes. We may divide the file's size by the maximum payload size of each datagram to get how many datagrams are needed to transport the 5 million bytes of MP3 data: 5 million bytes divided by 1,480 bytes per datagram results in 3,378.378378378378378 datagrams. We must round up to the next full integer since we are unable to transmit datagrams in fractions. This indicates that 3,379 datagrams will be required to transfer the 5 million byte MP3 file. By dividing the size of the MP3 file by the maximum payload size allowed for each datagram and rounding to the closest whole number, we were able to determine the necessary number of datagrams.
