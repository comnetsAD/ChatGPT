We need to know how many datagrams are necessary to deliver a 5 million-byte MP3 file from Host A to Host B. Because datagrams are restricted to 1,500 bytes (including the header) and the IP header is 20 bytes, the maximum payload size in each datagram is 1,500 bytes - 20 bytes = 1,480 bytes. We may divide the file size by the maximum payload size of each datagram to obtain the number of datagrams necessary to transport the 5 million byte MP3 file: (5 million bytes) / (1,480 bytes/datagram) = 3,378.3783783783783783783783783783783783783783783783783783783783783783783783783783783783783 We must round up to the next full integer since we cannot transmit a portion of a datagram. This indicates that sending the 5 million byte MP3 file will need 3,379 datagrams. The number of datagrams needed was calculated by dividing the size of the MP3 file by the maximum payload size of each datagram and rounding up to the next whole integer.
