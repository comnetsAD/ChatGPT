To deliver a 5 million-byte MP3 file from source Host A to destination Host B, it is necessary to calculate the amount of datagrams needed for transmission. Since each datagram is restricted to 1,500 bytes (including the header), the number of datagrams required may be calculated by dividing the size of the MP3 file by the maximum size of a datagram. To get the maximum size of each datagram, we must remove from the maximum datagram size the size of the IP header. Therefore, the maximum size of the payload in a datagram is 1500 - 20 = 1480 bytes. To find the number of datagrams required to transport the MP3 file, we may divide the file's size (5 million bytes) by the maximum payload size (1,480 bytes) of each datagram: (5,000,000 bytes) / (1480 bytes/datagram) = 3,378 datagrams Therefore, 3,378 datagrams are needed to transmit the MP3 file from Host A to Host B.
