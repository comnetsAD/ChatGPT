For example, we need to know how many datagrams are needed to transfer a five-million-byte MP3 from Host A to Host B. With the maximum size of a datagram set at 1,500 bytes (including header), the required number of datagrams may be calculated from an MP3 file's size. Deducting the size of the IP header from the maximum datagram size yields the maximum size of each datagram. Since the IP header takes up 20 bytes, the maximum payload size for a datagram is 1480 bytes, or 1500 minus 20. The number of datagrams required to send the MP3 file may be calculated by dividing the file size (in bytes) by the maximum payload size (in bytes) for each datagram: (five million bytes) / (1480 bytes/datagram) = (three thousand three hundred and seventy-eight) datagrams Therefore, the transmission of the MP3 file from Host A to Host B would need a total of 3,378 datagrams.
