To deliver a 5 million-byte MP3 from source Host A to destination Host B, we must first calculate the amount of datagrams necessary to send the file. We can compute the number of datagrams required by dividing the size of the MP3 file by the maximum size of each datagram, which is 1,500 bytes (including the header). To get the maximum datagram size, subtract the size of the IP header from the maximum datagram size. Because the IP header is 20 bytes long, the maximum payload size in each datagram is 1500 - 20 = 1480 bytes. To calculate the number of datagrams required to send the MP3 file, divide the file size (5 million bytes) by the maximum payload size of each datagram (1480 bytes): (5,000,000 bytes) divided by (1480 bytes/datagram) equals 3,378 datagrams. As a result, sending the MP3 file from Host A to Host B would need a total of 3,378 datagrams.
