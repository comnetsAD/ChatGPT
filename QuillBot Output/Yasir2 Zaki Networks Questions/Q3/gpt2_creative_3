Determine the number of datagrams needed to transfer a 5-million-byte MP3 file from Host A to Host B. Given that datagrams may only include up to 1,500 bytes (including header) and that the IP header takes up 20 bytes, the maximum size of the payload in each datagram is 1,500 bytes minus 20 bytes = 1,480 bytes. By dividing the file size by the maximum payload size of each datagram, we can determine how many datagrams will be needed to transmit the 5-million-byte MP3 file. (5,000,000 bytes) / (1,480 bytes/datagram) = 3,378.378.378.378378 datagrams We must round up to the closest full integer since sending a portion of a datagram is not possible. To transmit the 5,000,000-byte MP3 file, 3,379 datagrams will be required. We calculated the necessary datagram count by dividing the MP3 file size by the maximum payload size of each datagram and rounding up to the next whole integer.
