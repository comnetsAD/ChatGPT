In order to transfer an MP3 file that is 5 million bytes in size from Host A to Host B, we need to determine the number of datagrams that are necessary for the transfer. Because datagrams are only allowed 1,500 bytes (including the header), and the size of an IP header is 20 bytes, the maximum amount of the payload that may be included in a datagram is 1,500 bytes minus 20 bytes, which is 1,480 bytes. We may divide the size of the MP3 file, which is 5 million bytes, by the maximum payload size of each datagram, which is 128 kilobytes, to get the number of datagrams that will be needed to transport the file. (5 million bytes) divided by (1,480 bytes per datagram) equals 3,378.378378378378378378378 datagrams Because it is not possible to transmit a datagram containing a fraction, we will have to round the number up to the next full number. This indicates that in order to transfer the MP3 file that is 5 million bytes in size, we will need 3,379 datagrams. We were able to calculate the necessary number of datagrams by dividing the size of the MP3 file by the maximum payload size of each datagram, and then rounding the result to the closest whole number.
