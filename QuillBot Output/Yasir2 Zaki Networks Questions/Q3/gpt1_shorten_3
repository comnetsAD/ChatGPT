We must calculate the amount of datagrams needed to deliver a 5-million-byte MP3 from Host A to Host B. By dividing the MP3 file size by the maximum datagram size of 1,500 bytes (including header), we may compute the number of datagrams required. We deduct the IP header from the maximum datagram size to get its maximum size. Each datagram's payload may be 1500 - 20 = 1480 bytes since the IP header is 20 bytes. To calculate the number of datagrams required to send the MP3 file, divide the file's size (5 million bytes) by the maximum payload size (1480 bytes): (5,000,000 bytes/1480 bytes/datagram) = 3,378 datagrams Thus, sending the MP3 file from Host A to Host B requires 3,378 datagrams.
