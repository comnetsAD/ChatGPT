In order to transfer an MP3 file that is 5 million bytes in size from Host A to Host B, it would need 5,000,000 bytes divided by 1,500, which is equal to 3,333 datagrams. This is due to the fact that the overall size of an MP3 file is 5 million bytes, whereas each datagram may only contain a maximum of 1,500 bytes (including the header). In order to determine how many datagrams are necessary, we must first divide the size of the MP3 (five million bytes) by the largest size that can be included inside a single datagram (1,500 bytes). This tells us that in order to transfer the MP3, there must be a total of 3,333 datagrams. It is essential to keep in mind that the maximum size of each datagram takes into account the size of the IP header, which is 20 bytes. In the event that the IP header was excluded from the calculation of the maximum size, the needed quantity of datagrams would increase somewhat.
