To transfer a 5 million-byte MP3 from Host A to Host B, you would need to send 5,000,000 / 1,500 = 3,333 datagrams. This is due to the fact that each datagram, including the header, is restricted to 1,500 bytes, while the entire size of the MP3 is 5 million bytes. To get the number of datagrams needed, divide the size of the MP3 (5 million bytes) by the maximum size of each datagram (1,500 bytes). The total amount of datagrams necessary to transfer the MP3 is therefore 3,333. It is vital to remember that the maximum size of each datagram includes the size of the IP header (20 bytes). The number of datagrams needed would be significantly larger if the IP header was not included in the maximum size.
