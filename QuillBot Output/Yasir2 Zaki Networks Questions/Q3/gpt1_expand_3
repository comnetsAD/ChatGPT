In order to transfer an MP3 file that is 5 million bytes in size from Host A, where it was created, to Host B, where it will be received, we need to figure out the number of datagrams that are necessary to deliver the file. We are able to compute the number of datagrams that are required by dividing the size of the MP3 file by the maximum size of each datagram, which is restricted to 1,500 bytes (including the header). To get the maximum size of each datagram, we must first take the maximum size of a datagram and then deduct the size of the IP header from that number. Due to the fact that the IP header takes up 20 bytes, the maximum amount of the payload that may be included in a single datagram is 1500 bytes minus 20 bytes, which is 1480 bytes. We can compute the number of datagrams required to transmit the MP3 file by dividing the size of the file (five million bytes) by the maximum size of the payload that may be sent inside a single datagram (1,480 bytes): (5,000,000 bytes) / (1480 bytes/datagram) = 3,378 datagrams As a consequence of this, there would need to be a total of 3,378 datagrams sent in order to move the MP3 file from Host A to Host B.
