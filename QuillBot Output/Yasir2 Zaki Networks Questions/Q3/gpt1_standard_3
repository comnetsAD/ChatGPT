To deliver a 5 million byte MP3 from source Host A to destination Host B, we need to figure out how many datagrams are necessary to send the file. The number of datagrams required may be determined by dividing the size of the MP3 file by the maximum size of each datagram, which is 1,500 bytes (including header). The size of the IP header must be subtracted from the maximum datagram size in order to get the maximum size of each datagram. The maximum size of the payload in each datagram is 1500 - 20 = 1480 bytes since the IP header takes up 20 bytes. By dividing the MP3 file's size (5 million bytes) by the maximum allowable payload size of each datagram (1480 bytes), we can calculate the number of datagrams required to transport the MP3 file: 5,0,000,000 bytes divided by 1,480 datagrams is 3,378 datagrams. Therefore, sending the MP3 file from Host A to Host B would take 3,378 datagrams altogether.
