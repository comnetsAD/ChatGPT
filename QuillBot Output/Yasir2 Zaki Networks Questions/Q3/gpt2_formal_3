To transport a 5 million-byte MP3 file from Host A to Host B, we must determine how many datagrams are necessary. Since datagrams are restricted to 1,500 bytes (including the header) and the IP header is 20 bytes, the maximum payload size per datagram is 1,500 - 20 = 1,480 bytes. To determine the number of datagrams necessary to transmit a 5-million-byte MP3 file, divide the file size by the maximum payload size of each datagram: (5 million bytes) / (1,480 bytes/datagram) = 3,378.378378378378378378378378378 datagrams Since we cannot transmit a datagram containing a fraction, we must round to the closest full integer. This indicates that 3,379 datagrams will be required to transmit the 5 million-byte MP3 file. We determined the needed number of datagrams by dividing the size of the MP3 file by the maximum payload size of each datagram and then rounding to the closest whole integer.
