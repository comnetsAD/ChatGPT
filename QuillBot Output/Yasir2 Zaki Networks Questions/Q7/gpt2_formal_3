To get the 1's complement of the sum of three 8-bit bytes, we must first calculate the total of the bytes. 01010011 plus 01100110 plus 01110100 equals: 01010011 01100110\s01110100\s11000111 In binary, the total of the bytes is 110001111, or 199 in decimal. To get the 1's complement of the total, each bit of the sum must be inverted. 11000111's 1's complement is 00111000 in binary, or 56 in decimal. UDP uses the sum's complement of 1 because it enables the receiver to readily identify data problems. If the total of the bytes is right, its 1's complement will consist entirely of zeros. If there is a mistake in the data, the sum's 1's complement will not equal zero. The output should be a multiple of 256 for the 1's complement approach to identify problems (that is, the least significant 8 bits should be all zeros). The data should be destroyed if the result is not a multiple of 256.
