We must first determine the total of the three 8-bit bytes in order to get the 1's complement of that sum. 01010011 plus 01100110 plus 01110100 equals: 01010011 01100110\s01110100\s11000111 The total number of bytes is 199 in decimal form, or 11000111 in binary. We must invert each piece of the total in order to get the 1's complement. The binary equivalent of the number 11000111 is 00111000, or 56 in decimal. Because it makes it simple for the receiver to see data problems, UDP uses the 1's complement of the total. The 1's complement of the total will include only zeros if the bytes have been added up correctly. The sum's 1's complement will not be zero if there is a mistake in the data. The receiver just has to add the received bytes and the checksum in order to identify mistakes when utilizing the 1's complement technique, and the result should be a multiple of 256. (that is, the least significant 8 bits should be all zeros). The data should be destroyed if the outcome is not a multiple of 256, which indicates that there has been an error.
