The total of the three 8-bit bytes must be determined before determining its 1's complement. 01010011 + 01100110 + 01110100 equals 01010011 01100110\s01110100\s11000111 The total number of bits is 11000111 in binary, or 199 in decimal notation. By inverting each bit of the total, we may get the 1's complement. For example, in binary, 11000111 is represented as 00111000, or 56 in decimal. To facilitate mistake detection at the receiving end, UDP uses the 1's complement of the total. The 1's complement of the total of the bytes will be all zeros if the sum is valid. An inaccuracy in the data will be shown by a non-zero result for the 1's complement of the sum. In 1's complement, if the receiver adds the bytes it has received to the checksum, the result should be a multiple of 256, indicating that no mistakes have occurred in the transmission (that is, the least significant 8 bits should be all zeros). Data should be deleted if the result is not a multiple of 256.
