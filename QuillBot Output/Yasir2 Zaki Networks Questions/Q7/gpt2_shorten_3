First, we must determine the total of the three 8-bit bytes to obtain their 1's complement. 01010011+01100110+01110100= 01010011 01100110\s01110100\s11000111 11000111 in binary equals 199 in decimal. Inverting each bit yields the sum's 1's complement. 11000111's binary complement is 00111000, or 56 in decimal. The receiver may readily identify data problems using UDP's 1's complement sum. The 1's complement of the right bytes total will be all zeros. If data is wrong, the sum's 1's complement will be non-zero. The receiver adds the received bytes and checksum, which should be a multiple of 256, to identify problems using the 1's complement algorithm (that is, the least significant 8 bits should be all zeros). If the result is not 256, trash the data.
