To calculate the 1's complement of the sum of the three 8-bit bytes, we must first compute the sum of the bytes. 01010011 + 01100110 + 01110100 equals: 01010011 01100110\s01110100\s11000111 In binary, the total of the bytes is 11000111, or 199 in decimal. To obtain the sum's 1's complement, we must invert each component of the sum. The binary equivalent of 11000111 is 00111000, or 56 in decimal. Because it helps the receiver to readily discover problems in the data, UDP uses the 1's complement of the total. If the bytes are correctly added, the 1's complement will be all zeros. If the data contains an error, the 1's complement of the total will be non-zero. To identify mistakes using the 1's complement approach, just add the received bytes plus the checksum; the result should be a multiple of 256. (that is, the least significant 8 bits should be all zeros). If the result is not a multiple of 256, an error has occurred and the data should be destroyed.
