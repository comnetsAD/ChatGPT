In order to get the value that is the 1's complement of the sum of the three 8-bit bytes, we must first determine the sum of the bytes. 01110100 is equal to the sum of 01010011 and 01100110, which is: 01010011 01100110\s01110100\s11000111 In binary, the total number of bytes is 11000111, which is equivalent to the decimal value 199. In order to obtain the value that is the sum's 1's complement, we need to invert each piece of the sum. 11000111 has a 1's complement that is represented in binary as 00111000, which is equivalent to the decimal value 56. UDP uses the sum's 1's complement because it enables the recipient to more readily identify any faults that may have occurred in the data. The 1's complement of the total of the bytes will consist entirely of zeros if the sum of the bytes is accurate. In the event that there is a mistake in the data, the complement of the sum to one will have a value that is not zero. The receiver just has to do a simple addition of the bytes that it has received and the checksum for the 1's complement method to be able to identify problems; the sum that it produces should be a multiple of 256. (that is, the least significant 8 bits should be all zeros). If the result is not a multiple of 256, this indicates that an error has been found, and the data should not be used further.
