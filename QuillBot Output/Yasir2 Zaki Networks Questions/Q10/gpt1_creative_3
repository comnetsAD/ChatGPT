If the link's data rate is R bps, then it will take L/R seconds to send a packet containing L bits. When the file is broken up into S-bit chunks, it will take L/R seconds to send each chunk. We want to reduce the total time it takes to transfer the packets from Host A to Host B so that the file transfer from Host A to Host B may proceed as quickly as possible. The data packet between Host A and Host B must be sent three times due to the fact that there are three connections between the two hosts. Since there are L packets and R seconds to broadcast them, the total time to send all L packets is 3 * (L/R) seconds. By reducing the ratio of L/R to a minimum, we may shorten the overall time required. Since L cannot be changed (it is always 80 + S), optimizing R will always result in the lowest L/R ratio. Given that the throughput of each connection is set at 80 + S bits per second, maximizing R requires minimizing L. Thus, we want to reduce S to a minimum to speed up the transfer of the file from Host A to Host B. As a result, the smallest feasible value of S, which is 0 bits, minimizes the time it takes to transfer the file from Host A to Host B.
