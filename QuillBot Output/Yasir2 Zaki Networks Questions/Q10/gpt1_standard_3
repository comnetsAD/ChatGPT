L/R seconds are required to send a packet of L bits across a connection with a transmission rate of R bps. If the file is divided into S-bit packets, it will take L/R seconds for each packet to send. We want to reduce the amount of time it takes to send all of the packets in order to move the file from Host A to Host B as quickly as possible. Each packet has to be broadcast three times since there are three connections connecting hosts A and B. As a result, it takes 3 * (L/R) seconds to transfer all of the packets. By reducing the value of L/R, we may reduce the overall amount of time. Since L is constant (it equals 80 plus S), increasing R is the only method to reduce L/R. Since each link's transmission rate is set, the only method to increase R is to reduce the amount of L, which equals 80 plus S. Therefore, we want to reduce the value of S in order to reduce the time it takes to transfer the file from Host A to Host B. As a result, the smallest value of S, or 0 bits, reduces the time required to transfer a file from Host A to Host B.
