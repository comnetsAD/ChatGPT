We need to decrease the amount of time it takes for the file to be sent over all three connections so that we can cut down on the amount of time it takes to move the file from Host A to Host B. L/R seconds is the amount of time needed to send a packet that contains L bits across a connection that has a transmission rate of R bps. The total amount of time it takes to send the file between Host A and Host B is, due to the fact that there are three connections between the two hosts: T = (L/R) * 3 Because we want to keep T to a minimum, we have to keep L as low as possible. Given that L is equal to 80 plus S, the value of L is dependent upon the value of S. Therefore, in order to reduce the amount of time it takes to move the file from Host A to Host B, we need to reduce the value of S as much as possible. It's important to keep in mind that the value of S can never be negative since it indicates the total amount of bits in the file's segments. As a result, the lowest possible value of S is 0. Therefore, in order to reduce downtime as much as possible during the transfer of the file from Host A to Host B, we should set S = 0. Because of this, L will end up having its minimal value, and as a consequence, T will also have its minimum value.
