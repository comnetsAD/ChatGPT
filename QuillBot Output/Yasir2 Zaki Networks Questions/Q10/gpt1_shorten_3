L/R seconds are needed to send an L-bit packet over an R-bps network. Each S-bit packet takes L/R seconds to broadcast. We aim to decrease packet transmission time to reduce file transfer time from Host A to Host B. Each packet must be broadcast three times since Host A and Host B have three connections. Thus, transmitting all packets takes 3 * (L/R) seconds. Minimizing L/R reduces this time. R must be maximized to decrease L/R because L is fixed (80 + S). Since each connection has a set transmission rate, R can only be maximized by minimizing L, which equals 80 + S. Thus, we aim to decrease S to minimize file transfer time from Host A to Host B. Thus, the minimal value of S, 0 bits, reduces the time of transferring the file from Host A to Host B.
