To reduce the time required to move the file from Host A to Host B, we must reduce the time required to transfer the file across the three connections. L/R seconds are required to send a packet of L bits across a connection with a transmission rate of R bps. Given that there are three connections between Host A and Host B, the total transmission time is: T = (L/R) * 3 We want to decrease T, hence we need to minimize L. L's value is determined by S's value, given that L = 80 + S. Therefore, to reduce the time required to transfer the file from Host A to Host B, we must reduce the value of S. Note that S cannot have a negative value, since it reflects the number of bits in each file segment. Consequently, the minimal value of S is zero. Therefore, to reduce the time required to transfer the file from Host A to Host B, we must set S = 0. This will provide the least value of L and, hence, the minimum value of T.
