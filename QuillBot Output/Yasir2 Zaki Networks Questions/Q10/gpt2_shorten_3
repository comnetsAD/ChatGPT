We need to decrease file transmission time along the three connections to minimize file transfer time from Host A to Host B. L/R seconds are needed to send an L-bit packet over an R-bps network. Three connections between Host A and Host B make file transmission take: T = (L/R) * 3 Reduce L to minimize T. L = 80 + S, hence S determines L. Thus, we must reduce S to reduce file transfer time from Host A to Host B. Since S represents the file's segment bits, it cannot be negative. Thus, S must be 0. To decrease file transfer time between Host A and Host B, set S = 0. This yields the minimal L and T values.
