We must reduce the amount of time the file spends being sent across the three connections in order to move it from Host A to Host B with the least amount of delay. L/R seconds are required to send a packet of L bits across a connection with a transmission rate of R bps. Between Hosts A and B, there are three connections, hence the total time needed to send the file is: T = (L/R) * 3 Because we wish to reduce T, we must also reduce L. Since L = 80 + S, the value of S determines the value of L. Therefore, we must reduce the value of S in order to reduce the time it takes to transfer the file from Host A to Host B. Because S indicates the number of bits in each file segment, its value cannot be negative. S has a minimum value of 0 as a result. So, we should set S = 0 in order to reduce the time it takes to transfer the file from Host A to Host B. As a consequence, L will have its minimal value, and as a result, T will have its minimum value.
