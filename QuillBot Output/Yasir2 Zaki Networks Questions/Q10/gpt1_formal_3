L/R seconds are required to send a packet of L bits across a connection with a transmission rate of R bps. If the file is divided into packets of S bits, then the transmission time for each packet is L/R seconds. To reduce the time required to move the file from Host A to Host B, we must reduce the time required to send each packet. Due to the fact that there are three connections between Host A and Host B, each packet must be sent three times. The total time required to send all packets is thus 3 * (L/R) seconds. This total time may be reduced by reducing the value of L/R. L is fixed (80 + S), hence the only method to decrease L/R is to increase R. Since each link's transmission rate is constant, the only method to maximize R is to reduce L, which is equal to 80 + S. To reduce the time required to transfer the file from Host A to Host B, we must reduce the value of S. Therefore, the smallest feasible value of S, which is 0 bits, minimizes the time of sending the file from Host A to Host B.
