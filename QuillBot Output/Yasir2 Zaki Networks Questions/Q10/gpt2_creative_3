The time it takes to transfer the file from Host A to Host B depends on how quickly it can be sent across each of the three connections. If the link's data rate is R bps, then it will take L/R seconds to send a packet containing L bits. Due to the fact that there are three connections between Host A and Host B, the total time it takes to send the file is: T = (L/R) * 3 To achieve our goal of reducing T, we must also reduce L. Since L = 80 + S, the value of S dictates what L will be. As a result, we want to decrease S so that the time it takes to transfer the file from Host A to Host B is as short as possible. Since S reflects the total amount of bits in the file, it cannot have a negative value. As a result, 0 is the smallest possible value of S. It follows that we should set S = 0 to ensure the quickest possible time between Host A and Host B during the file transfer. As a consequence, L will be at its lowest possible value, and T will be at its lowest possible value as well.
