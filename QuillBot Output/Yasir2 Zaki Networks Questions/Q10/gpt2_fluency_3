To reduce the time it takes to move the file from Host A to Host B, we must reduce the time it takes to transfer the file across the three connections. The time it takes to send a packet of L bits across a network with a transmission rate of R bits per second is measured in L/R seconds. Because there are three connections between Host A and Host B, the total time to send the file is: T = (L/R) * 3 We want to reduce T, thus we must reduce L. Because L = 80 + S, the value of L is dictated by the value of S. As a result, in order to reduce the time it takes to move the file from Host A to Host B, we must reduce the value of S. Because S reflects the number of bits in each section of the file, it cannot be negative. As a result, the minimal value of S is 0. As a result, we should set S = 0 to reduce the time it takes to move the file from Host A to Host B. This yields the smallest value of L, and hence the smallest value of T.
