L/R seconds is the amount of time needed to send a packet that contains L bits across a connection that has a transmission rate of R bps. If the file is divided into packets of S bits each, then the time it takes to send the packet ranges between L and R seconds. We want to limit the amount of time it takes for all of the packets to be sent so that we may cut down on the amount of time it takes to move the file from Host A to Host B. Because there are three connections between Host A and Host B, each packet has to be sent out three times before it can be considered successfully delivered. As a result, the total amount of time necessary to send all of the packets is 3 seconds multiplied by (L/R). We can shorten this total time by reducing the value of L/R as much as possible. Because L cannot be changed (it is always equal to 80 plus S), the only method to reduce L/R is to increase R's value. The only method to maximize R given that the transmission rate of each link is constant is to minimize the value of L, which is equal to 80 plus S. This is the only way to achieve this goal. As a result, we want to reduce the value of S as much as possible in order to cut down on the amount of time it takes to move the file from Host A to Host B. Therefore, the value of S that results in the quickest transfer of the file from Host A to Host B is the value of S that is as close to zero as is humanly feasible, which is 0 bits.
