The time it takes to send a packet of L bits across a network with a transmission rate of R bits per second is measured in L/R seconds. If the file is divided into S-bit packets, each packet takes L/R seconds to send. We want to reduce the time it takes to send all of the packets in order to reduce the delay of transporting the file from Host A to Host B. Each packet must be broadcast three times since there are three connections between Host A and Host B. As a result, the total time required to send all of the packets is 3 * (L/R) seconds. We may reduce the overall time by lowering the value of L/R. Because L is constant (it equals 80 + S), the only method to decrease L/R is to increase R. Because each link's transmission rate is fixed, the only method to maximize R is to reduce the value of L, which is equal to 80 + S. As a result, we wish to reduce the value of S in order to reduce the time it takes to move the file from Host A to Host B. As a result, the least feasible value of S, which is 0 bits, is the value of S that minimizes the latency of sending the file from Host A to Host B.
