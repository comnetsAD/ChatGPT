In a parity scheme with two dimensions, the field that stores the parity bits would have a value of 1111 if the system were two-dimensional. This is because in a two-dimensional parity scheme, parity bits are added to the information content of the packet in such a way as to ensure that the number of 1s in each row and column of the packet is even. The reason for this can be found in the fact that in a two-dimensional parity scheme, parity bits are added to the information content of the packet. We may think of the information contained inside the packet as a 4x4 matrix, with each row and column consisting of 4 bits, which will allow us to calculate the value of the parity bits in this particular scenario. The following is a representation of the information that is included inside the packet: 1110\s0110\s1001\s1101 We need to add parity bits to the packet in such a way that the resultant matrix has an even number of ones in each row and column. This will allow us to achieve our goal of having an equal number of ones in each row and column. This may be accomplished by include the parity bits 1111 in the packet, which will lead to the formation of the following matrix: 1110\s0110\s1001\s1101\s1111 Following the addition of the parity bits, the amount of ones in each row and column has been balanced, and the packet is now prepared for transmission. Because an even number of ones in each row and column requires a minimum of this many bits, the checksum field that is required to have the smallest possible length in this scenario would be four bits long. This is because four bits is the smallest possible number of bits that can accomplish this task.
