If using a two-dimensional parity system, the parity field's value would be 1111. This is due to the fact that parity bits are added to the packet's information in a two-dimensional parity scheme to make sure that the number of ones in each row and column is even. We may think of the data in the packet as a 4x4 matrix, where each row and column has 4 bits, and use this to calculate the value of the parity bits. Following is a representation of the data included in the packet: 1110\s0110\s1001\s1101 By include parity bits in the packet, we can guarantee that each row and column of the resultant matrix will have an equal number of 1. In order to do this, we may append the parity bits 1111 to the packet, which will result in the following matrix: 1110\s0110\s1001\s1101\s1111 By include the parity bits, we can ensure that there are an equal amount of ones in each row and column before sending the packet. To guarantee an equitable distribution of ones across rows and columns, a checksum field of at least 4 bits in length would be used in this scenario.
