The value of the field holding the parity bits in a two-dimensional parity scheme would be 1111. This is due to the two-dimensional parity scheme's need for equal parity across all packet's rows and columns. The bit pattern in question has four rows and four columns. The bits in the first row have an even parity (2 ones), the bits in the second row have an odd parity (3 ones), the bits in the third row have an even parity (2 ones), and the bits in the fourth row have an odd parity (3 ones). The bits in the first column are parity even (2 ones), the bits in the second column are parity even (2 ones), the bits in the third column are parity odd (3 ones), and the bits in the fourth column are parity odd (3 ones). We must set the parity bits to 1111 in order to guarantee that the parity of the bits in each row and column is even. Given that it is the smallest bit sequence that meets the two-dimensional parity condition, we will have a minimum-length checksum field.
