The value of the field holding the parity bits in a two-dimensional parity scheme would be 1111. This is because the two-dimensional parity system needs even bit parity in each row and column of the packet. There are four rows and four columns in the provided bit pattern. The bit parity in the first row is even (2 ones), the bit parity in the second row is odd (3 ones), the bit parity in the third row is even (2 ones), and the bit parity in the fourth row is odd (3 ones). The bits in the first column are even (2 ones), the bits in the second column are even (2 ones), the bits in the third column are odd (3 ones), and the bits in the fourth column are odd (3 ones) (3 ones). We must set the parity bits to 1111 to guarantee that the parity of the bits in each row and column is even. This gives us a checksum field with the smallest sequence of bits that meets the two-dimensional parity condition.
