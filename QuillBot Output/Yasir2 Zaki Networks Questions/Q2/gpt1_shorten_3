In a two-dimensional parity system, the parity bits field would be 1111. A two-dimensional parity system adds parity bits to the packet's information to level out the amount of 1s in each row and column. We may use the packet's information as a 4x4 matrix with 4 bits per row and column to calculate the parity bits. Packet content: 1110\s0110\s1001\s1101 We must add parity bits to the packet to verify that the matrix has an equal amount of 1s in each row and column. Adding parity bits 1111 to the packet creates the following matrix: 1110\s0110\s1001\s1101\s1111 The packet is ready to send after adding the parity bits. This situation requires a 4-bit checksum field to assure equal rows and columns of 1s.
