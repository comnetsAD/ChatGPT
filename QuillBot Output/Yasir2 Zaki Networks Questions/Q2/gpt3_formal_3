In a two-dimensional parity system, the field holding parity bits would have a value of 1111. The two-dimensional parity system necessitates that the parity of the bits in each row and column of the packet be even. The supplied bit pattern has four rows and four columns. Bits in the first row have an even parity (2 ones), bits in the second row have an odd parity (3 ones), bits in the third row have an even parity (2 ones), and bits in the fourth row have an odd parity (3 ones). Bits in the first column have an even parity (2 ones), bits in the second column have an even parity (2 ones), bits in the third column have an odd parity (3 ones), and bits in the fourth column have an odd parity (3 ones) (3 ones). To guarantee that the parity of each row and column's bits is even, the parity bits must be set to 1111. This will result in a checksum field of minimal length, since this is the smallest sequence of bits that meets the parity criterion for two dimensions.
