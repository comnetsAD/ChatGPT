If using a two-dimensional parity system, the parity field's value would be 1111. That's due to the fact that the two-dimensional parity method necessitates an equal parity between the bits in each row and column of the packet. The presented bit pattern consists of 4 rows and 4 columns. First row bits are even (2 ones), second row bits are odd (3 ones), third row bits are even (2 ones), and fourth row bits are odd (3 ones) (3 ones). When reading from left to right, the parity of the bits in the first column is even (2 ones), in the second column it is even (2 ones), in the third column it is odd (3 ones), and in the fourth column it is odd (3 ones). The bits in each row and column must have even parity, which may be achieved by setting the parity bits to 1111. Since this is the smallest sequence of bits that meets the two-dimensional parity condition, it will provide us with a checksum field of minimal length.
