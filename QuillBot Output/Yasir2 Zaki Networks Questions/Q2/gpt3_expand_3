In a parity scheme with two dimensions, the field that stores the parity bits would have a value of 1111 if the system were two-dimensional. This is because the two-dimensional parity method mandates that the parity of the bits in every row and column of the packet must be even for it to function properly. There are a total of 4 rows and 4 columns in the bit pattern that has been provided. There are two ones in the first row, three ones in the second row, two ones in the third row, and three ones in the fourth row. The parity of the bits in the first row is even, the parity of the bits in the second row is odd, and the parity of the bits in the third row is even (3 ones). There are two ones in each bit in the first column, two ones in each bit in the second column, three ones in each bit in the third column, and four ones in each bit in the fourth column. The parity of the bits in the first column is even, the parity of the bits in the second column is even, the parity of the bits in the third column is odd, and the parity of the bits in the fourth column is odd (3 ones). It is necessary to set the parity bits to 1111 so that we may be certain that the bits in each row and column have an equal parity. Because this is the shortest sequence of bits that meets the criteria for two-dimensional parity, it will provide us with a checksum field that has the smallest possible length.
