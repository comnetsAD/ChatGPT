The value of the field holding the parity bits in a two-dimensional parity scheme would be 1111. This is due to the fact that in a two-dimensional parity scheme, parity bits are added to the packet's information content in order to make sure that the number of 1s in each row and column is equal. By visualizing the information content of the packet as a 4x4 matrix with 4 bits in each row and column, we can calculate the value of the parity bits in this scenario. The following may be used to indicate the packet's information content: 1110\s0110\s1001\s1101 We need to add parity bits to the packet so that the resultant matrix has an even number of 1s in each row and column. This will guarantee that there are an even number of 1s in each row and column. This may be accomplished by adding the parity bits 1111 to the packet, creating the matrix shown below: 1110\s0110\s1001\s1101\s1111 The addition of the parity bits makes the number of 1s in every row and column even, and the packet is now prepared for transmission. The checksum field would need to be at least 4 bits long in this scenario to guarantee that there are an equal amount of 1s in each row and column.
