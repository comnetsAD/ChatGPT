In a two-dimensional parity system, the parity bits field would be 1111. The two-dimensional parity system needs even bit parity in each packet row and column. The bit pattern has 4 rows and 4 columns. The first row has even bits (2 ones), the second row odd (3 ones), the third row even (2 ones), and the fourth row odd (3 ones) (3 ones). The bits in the first and second columns are even (2 ones), the third column is odd (3 ones), and the fourth column is odd (3 ones) (3 ones). Set the parity bits to 1111 to guarantee equal parity in each row and column. The smallest sequence of bits that meets the two-dimensional parity condition gives us a minimum-length checksum field.
