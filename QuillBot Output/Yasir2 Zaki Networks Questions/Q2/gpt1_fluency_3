The value of the field holding the parity bits in a two-dimensional parity scheme would be 1111. This is due to the fact that in a two-dimensional parity scheme, parity bits are added to the packet's information content in such a manner that the number of 1s in each row and column of the packet is even. To estimate the value of the parity bits in this scenario, imagine the packet's information content as a 4x4 matrix with 4 bits in each row and column. The packet's information content is expressed as follows: 1110\s0110\s1001\s1101 To guarantee that the number of 1s in each row and column is even, we must add parity bits to the packet, resulting in a matrix with an even number of 1s in each row and column. We may do this by appending the parity bits 1111 to the packet, resulting in the matrix shown below: 1110\s0110\s1001\s1101\s1111 The addition of the parity bits makes the number of 1s in each row and column even, and the packet is now ready to be sent. In this scenario, the minimum-length checksum field would be 4 bits long, since this is the smallest number of bits required to verify that the number of 1s in each row and column is even.
