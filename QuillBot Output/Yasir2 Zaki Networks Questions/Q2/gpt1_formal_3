In a two-dimensional parity system, the field holding parity bits would have a value of 1111. In a two-dimensional parity system, parity bits are added to the packet's information content to guarantee an equal number of ones in each row and column. To calculate the value of the parity bits in this instance, we may represent the packet's contents as a 4x4 matrix with each row and column holding 4 bits. Following is a representation of the information included in the packet: 1110\s0110\s1001\s1101 To guarantee that there are an equal number of 1s in each row and column, parity bits must be added to the packet so that the resultant matrix has an even number of 1s in each row and column. This is accomplished by adding the parity bits 1111 to the packet, resulting in the matrix shown below. 1110\s0110\s1001\s1101\s1111 With the addition of the parity bits, the number of ones in each row and column is now even, and the packet is prepared for transmission. In this instance, the minimum-length checksum field would be 4 bits long, since this is the amount of bits required to guarantee that the number of ones in each row and column is even.
