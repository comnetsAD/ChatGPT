If human DNA has a 20% mole-percent C content, then 20%, 20%, and 60%, respectively, would be the mole-percentages of A, G, and T. The reason for this is because the four nucleotides that make up DNA—adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G)—always couple up in a particular manner: A with T and C with G. Accordingly, there must be a G and a T for every C and an A in the DNA, respectively. As a result, the mole percent of A, G, and T would be 20%, the same as the mole percent of C.
