Molecular percentages of A, G, and T would be 20%, 20%, and 60%, respectively, if human DNA contained 20% C on a molar basis. This is due to the fact that each of DNA's four nucleotides—A, T, C, and G—always forms specific pairs—A with T, and C with G. There must be a G and a T for every C and A in the DNA. A, G, and T would all have the same mole percent as C (20%).
