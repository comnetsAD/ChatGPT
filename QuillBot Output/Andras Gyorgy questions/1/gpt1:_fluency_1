If human DNA includes 20% C, then the mole percent of A, G, and T are 20%, 20%, and 60%, respectively. This is due to the fact that the four nucleotides in DNA are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G), and they always couple up in the same way: A with T, and C with G. This means that there must be a G for every C in the DNA and a T for every A. As a result, the mole percent of A, G, and T equals the mole percent of C, which is 20%.
