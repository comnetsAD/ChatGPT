If human DNA has a molecular concentration of 20% carbon, then the mole percentages of the other three nucleotides, A, G, and T, would be, respectively, 20%, 20%, and 60%. This is because the four nucleotides that make up DNA are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G), and these nucleotides always pair up in a specific way: A with T, and C with G. This results in the phenomenon that we are discussing. This indicates that there must be a G for every C found in the DNA, and there must be a T for every A found in the DNA. As a result, the mole percent of C, which is 20%, would be equivalent to the mole percent of A, G, and T, which would be equal.
