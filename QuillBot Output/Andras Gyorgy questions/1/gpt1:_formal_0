If human DNA contains 20% C by mole, then the mole percentages of A, G, and T are 20%, 20%, and 60%, respectively. In DNA, the four nucleotides are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G), and they always pair up in a particular manner: A with T and C with G. This means that every C in the DNA must be paired with a G, and every A must be paired with a T. Therefore, the mole percent of A, G, and T would equal 20%, which is the mole percent of C.
