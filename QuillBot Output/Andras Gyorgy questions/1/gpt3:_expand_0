In human DNA, if 20% of the molecular composition is C, the mole percentages of A, G, and T will not be equal because these bases do not pair with each other. Instead, the mole percent of A, G, and T will be determined by the overall base composition of DNA, which differs between species and also varies within the same species. This is because DNA is made up of different bases.
