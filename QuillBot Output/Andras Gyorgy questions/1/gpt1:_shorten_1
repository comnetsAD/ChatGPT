A, G, and T would be 20%, 20%, and 60%, respectively, if human DNA contains 20% C molarly. The four nucleotides in DNA—adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G)—always couple up in a precise way: A with T, C with G. The DNA must have a G for every C and a T for every A. Thus, A, G, and T have the same mole percent as C, 20%.
