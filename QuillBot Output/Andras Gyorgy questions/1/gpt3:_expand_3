In human DNA, if 20% of the molecular makeup is C, the mole percentages of A, G, and T will not be identical since these bases do not couple with each other. Instead, the mole percent of A, G, and T will be decided by the total base composition of DNA, which differs across species and even fluctuates within the same species. This is because DNA is made up of multiple bases.
