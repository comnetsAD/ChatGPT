The formation of hydrogen bonds is a type of noncovalent bond that takes place between an electropositive hydrogen atom and two electronegative atoms, typically nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine. Hydrogen bonds are the most common type of chemical bond. Although the strength of these bonds is only about 5-10% that of a covalent bond, they are extremely important to the stability of a wide variety of biological molecules, including DNA and proteins. When the partially positive charge on the hydrogen atom is attracted to the partially negative charge on the electronegative atom, a hydrogen bond is formed between the two atoms. As a consequence of this, a bond is formed as a result of the hydrogen atom being "shared" between the two atoms. The hydrogen bond is directional, which means that it can only form when the atoms are aligned in a particular way with respect to one another. Because of their high degree of specificity, hydrogen bonds are able to play an important part in the structure and function of a wide variety of biological molecules.
