An electropositive hydrogen atom forms a hydrogen bond with two electronegative atoms, usually nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine. Although only 5-10% as strong as a covalent link, ionic bonds are essential to the stability of many biological components, including DNA and proteins. When a partially positive hydrogen atom comes into contact with a partially negative electronegative atom, a hydrogen bond is formed. This forms a link between the two atoms since the hydrogen is "shared" between them. The formation of a hydrogen bond is strongly dependent on the relative orientation of the atoms involved. Hydrogen bonds are very specific, which permits them to play an important role in the structure and function of many biological compounds.
