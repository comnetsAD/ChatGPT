Noncovalent hydrogen bonds form between an electropositive hydrogen atom and two electronegative atoms, typically nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine. These bonds are relatively weak, with a strength of 5-10% that of a covalent bond, but they play an important role in the stability of many biological molecules, including DNA and proteins. When the partial positive charge on the hydrogen atom attracts the partial negative charge on the electronegative atom, a hydrogen bond is formed. As a result, the hydrogen atom is "shared" by the two atoms, forming a bond. The hydrogen bond is directional, which means it can only form when the atoms are oriented in a specific way relative to each other. Because of this specificity, hydrogen bonds play an important role in the structure and function of many biological molecules.
