Noncovalent hydrogen bonds arise between an electropositive hydrogen atom and two electronegative atoms, generally nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine. These connections are rather weak, with a strength of 5-10% that of a covalent bond, yet they serve an important role in the stability of many biological entities, including DNA and proteins. When the partial positive charge on the hydrogen atom attracts the partial negative charge on the electronegative atom, a hydrogen bond is formed. As a result, the hydrogen atom is "shared" by the two atoms, forming a connection. The hydrogen bond is directional, which means it can only form when the atoms are orientated in a precise way relative to each other. Because of this selectivity, hydrogen bonds play an important role in the structure and function of many biological molecules.
