An electropositive hydrogen atom and two electronegative atoms, generally nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine, create hydrogen bonds, a type of noncovalent bond. These connections have a strength that is only around 5â€“10% that of a covalent bond, but despite this, they are extremely important for the stability of many biological components, including DNA and proteins. The partial positive charge on the hydrogen atom attracts the partial negative charge on the electronegative atom, forming the hydrogen bond. As a result, a bond is formed when the hydrogen atom is "shared" by the two atoms. The hydrogen bond is directional, which means that it only develops when the atoms are arranged in a particular orientation with respect to one another. Because of this selectivity, hydrogen bonding can be crucial to the structure and operation of numerous biological molecules.
