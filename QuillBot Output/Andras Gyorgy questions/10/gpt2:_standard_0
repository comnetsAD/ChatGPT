An electropositive hydrogen atom and two electronegative atoms, typically nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine, form hydrogen bonds, a type of noncovalent bond. These bonds have a strength that is only about 5â€“10% that of a covalent bond, but despite this, they are extremely important for the stability of many biological molecules, including DNA and proteins. The partial positive charge on the hydrogen atom attracts the partial negative charge on the electronegative atom, forming the hydrogen bond. As a result, a bond is formed when the hydrogen atom is "shared" by the two atoms. The hydrogen bond is directional, which means that it only develops when the atoms are arranged in a particular orientation with respect to one another. Because of this specificity, hydrogen bonds can be crucial to the structure and operation of numerous biological molecules.
