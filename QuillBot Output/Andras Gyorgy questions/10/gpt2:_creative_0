An electropositive hydrogen atom forms a hydrogen bond with two electronegative atoms, usually nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine. Although only 5-10% as strong as a covalent bond, ionic bonds are essential to the stability of many biological molecules, including DNA and proteins. When a partially positive hydrogen atom comes into contact with a partially negative electronegative atom, a hydrogen bond is formed. This forms a bond between the two atoms because the hydrogen is "shared" between them. The formation of a hydrogen bond is strongly dependent on the relative orientation of the atoms involved. Hydrogen bonds are highly specific, which allows them to play an important role in the structure and function of many biological molecules.
