Electropositive hydrogen atoms form hydrogen bonds with two electronegative atoms, usually nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine. These bonds, which are 5-10% as strong as covalent bonds, stabilize many biological molecules like DNA and proteins. The hydrogen bond forms when the hydrogen atom's partial positive charge attracts the electronegative atom's partial negative charge. The two atoms bond by "sharing" the hydrogen atom. The hydrogen bond forms only when the atoms are aligned. Hydrogen bonds help shape and function many biological molecules due to their specificity.
