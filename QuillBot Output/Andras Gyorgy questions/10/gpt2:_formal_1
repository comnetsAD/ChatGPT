Hydrogen bonds are a noncovalent bond formed between an electropositive hydrogen atom and two electronegative atoms, generally nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine. The strength of these interactions is approximately 5-10% that of a covalent link, but they are essential to the stability of many biological components, such as DNA and proteins. When the partial positive charge on the hydrogen atom attracts the partial negative charge on the electronegative atom, the hydrogen bond develops. This causes the hydrogen atom to be "shared" by the two atoms, forming a connection. The hydrogen bond is directional, meaning that it can only form when the atoms are aligned in a particular manner relative to one another. This selectivity enables hydrogen bonding to play a crucial role in the structure and function of numerous biomolecular structures.
