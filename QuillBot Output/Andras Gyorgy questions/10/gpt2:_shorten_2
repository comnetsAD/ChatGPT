Electropositive hydrogen atoms create hydrogen bonds with two electronegative atoms, usually nitrogen, oxygen, or fluorine. These connections, which are 5-10% as strong as covalent bonds, stabilize numerous biological components including DNA and proteins. The hydrogen bond formed when the hydrogen atom's partial positive charge attracts the electronegative atom's partial negative charge. The two atoms bind by "sharing" the hydrogen atom. The hydrogen bond develops only when the atoms are aligned. Hydrogen bonding help shape and operate many biological molecules due to their specificity.
