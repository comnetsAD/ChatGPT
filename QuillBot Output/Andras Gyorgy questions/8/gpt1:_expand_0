The term "promoter" refers to the nucleotide sequence in DNA that RNA polymerase binds to in order to initiate the process of transcription. The promoter is a nucleotide sequence that is located upstream (on the 5' side) of the gene that is being transcribed. It is also known as the transcription factor. It is a binding site for the RNA polymerase enzyme, which is responsible for recognizing the promoter and starting the transcription process at that point. This promoter sequence typically includes particular consensus sequences that different transcription factors can bind to and use to bring the RNA polymerase enzyme to the appropriate location.
