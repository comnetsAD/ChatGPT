The promoter is the DNA nucleotide sequence that RNA polymerase attaches to to start transcription. The gene being transcribed has a specific sequence of nucleotides upstream (on the 5' side) called the promoter. The RNA polymerase enzyme uses it as a binding site, and once it recognizes the promoter, it starts transcription. Typically, this promoter region has particular consensus sequences that allow the various transcription factors to bind and draw the RNA polymerase enzyme to the proper place.
