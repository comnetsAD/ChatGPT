Promoter refers to the nucleotide sequence in DNA to which RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription. The promoter is a specific nucleotide sequence located upstream (5') of the gene that is being transcribed. It functions as a binding site for the RNA polymerase enzyme, which recognizes the promoter and initiates transcription there. Typically, this promoter sequence contains consensus sequences for the various transcription factors to bind and recruit the RNA polymerase enzyme to the correct location.
