The promoter is the nucleotide sequence in DNA to which RNA polymerase binds to initiate transcription. The promoter is a nucleotide sequence that is located upstream (on the 5' side) of the gene being transcribed. It acts as a binding site for the RNA polymerase enzyme, which recognizes the promoter and starts transcription. This promoter sequence typically contains specific consensus sequences for the various transcription factors to bind to and recruit the RNA polymerase enzyme to the proper location.
