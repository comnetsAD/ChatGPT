Promoter refers to the nucleotide sequence in DNA to which RNA polymerase attaches to initiate transcription. The promoter is a specific nucleotide sequence positioned upstream (5') of the gene that is being transcribed. It functions as a binding site for the RNA polymerase enzyme, which detects the promoter and initiates transcription there. Typically, this promoter region contains consensus sequences for the various transcription factors to bind and recruit the RNA polymerase enzyme to the right place.
