RNA polymerase attaches to the promoter to start transcription. Upstream (5') of the gene being transcribed is the promoter. RNA polymerase identifies the promoter and starts transcription at this location. The transcription factors bind and recruit the RNA polymerase enzyme to this promoter region.
