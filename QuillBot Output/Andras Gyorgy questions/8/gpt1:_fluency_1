The promoter is the nucleotide sequence in DNA to which RNA polymerase attaches to initiate transcription. The promoter is a nucleotide sequence that is placed upstream (on the 5' side) of the gene being transcribed. It acts as a binding site for the RNA polymerase enzyme, which detects the promoter and starts transcription. This promoter sequence often comprises specific consensus sequences for the various transcription factors to bind to and attract the RNA polymerase enzyme to the proper site.
