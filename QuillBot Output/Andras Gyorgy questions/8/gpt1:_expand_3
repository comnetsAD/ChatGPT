The term "promoter" refers to the nucleotide sequence in DNA that RNA polymerase attaches to in order to initiate the process of transcription. The promoter is a nucleotide sequence that is positioned upstream (on the 5' side) of the gene that is being transcribed. It is also known as the transcription factor. It is a binding site for the RNA polymerase enzyme, which is responsible for recognizing the promoter and starting the transcription process at that moment. This promoter sequence often includes certain consensus sequences that various transcription factors may bind to and use to bring the RNA polymerase enzyme to the appropriate position.
