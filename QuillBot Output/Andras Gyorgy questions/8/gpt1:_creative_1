The promoter is a DNA sequence that RNA polymerase attaches to initiate transcription. The promoter is a nucleotide sequence that is upstream (5') of the gene being transcribed. The enzyme RNA polymerase binds to this location when it finds a promoter, and transcription begins. Various transcription factors bind to consensus sequences in this promoter region, which then attract the RNA polymerase enzyme to the proper site.
