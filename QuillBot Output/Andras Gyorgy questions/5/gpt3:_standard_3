Short sequence searches are often preferable to lengthy sequence searches because they are more focused and less likely to provide false positive results. A lengthier sequence raises the possibility of finding a match but also raises the possibility of discovering a non-homologous sequence that, by coincidence, also has the same sequence. Additionally, the likelihood of discovering distant homologs is increased by the likelihood that a short signature sequence would be preserved across evolutionary distant taxa.
