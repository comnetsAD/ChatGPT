Searching the database using a small signature sequence suggestive of the specific protein activity is a typical technique for locating distantly related homologous proteins. It is recommended to use a short signature sequence rather than a lengthy one due to the following reasons: High selectivity: a short signature sequence is more likely to match with similar proteins in the database and is more specialized to a particular protein activity. This improves the likelihood that the proper protein will be found among the hits in the database. Sparse computational requirements: It is computationally more efficient to search the database using a short sequence than a large one. Since it might be laborious to calculate similarities between a given sequence and all the others in the database, a shorter sequence is preferable. Because short signature sequences are often generated from conserved sections of a protein, they are more resistant to mutations and hence more useful for detecting homologs. Sensitivity is high because signature sequences originate from functionally important conserved areas of proteins. This guarantees that the signature sequence can detect distant homologs despite alterations in the sequence, in addition to those that are closely related. Using a short signature sequence to look for distantly related homologous proteins is preferred over a large sequence because it is more specific, requires less computing effort, is more resistant to mutations, and is more sensitive to evolutionary divergence.
