In general, searching using a short sequence is preferable than searching with a lengthy sequence since short sequences are more specific and less prone to false positives. A longer sequence enhances the likelihood of finding a match, but it also raises the likelihood of discovering a non-homologous sequence that happens to contain the same sequence by accident. A short signature sequence is also more likely to be preserved across evolutionarily distant animals, increasing the likelihood of discovering distant homologs.
