For numerous reasons, employing a short signature sequence to search for distantly related homologous proteins is seen to be a superior method than using a lengthy sequence: A short signature sequence is more unique to a certain protein activity and is less likely to match with other proteins in the database. Long sequences, on the other hand, are more likely to have high homology areas that are not unique to the protein function. Lower computational cost: Searching the database with a short sequence is less costly computationally than searching with a big sequence. This is because comparing a shorter sequence to other sequences in the database involves fewer computations, which might be time-consuming. Signature sequences are generally formed from conserved sections of a protein that are crucial for its function, despite their small length. This guarantees that the signature sequence will recognize both closely related and distant homologs. Short signature sequences are less likely to be influenced by evolutionary divergence since they are drawn from conserved sections. This implies that they will be able to recognize homologs even in creatures that are distantly related. In conclusion, using a short signature sequence to search for distantly related homologous proteins is thought to be a superior technique than utilizing a large sequence since it is more specific, less computationally costly, and more sensitive to evolutionary divergence.
