Short sequences are more specific and less prone to false positives, hence they are better for searching. Longer sequences enhance the odds of finding a match but also increase the odds of discovering a non-homologous sequence with the same sequence by chance. Short signature sequences are more likely to be preserved across evolutionarily distant species, making distant homologs easier to find.
