There are various reasons why employing a short signature sequence instead of a lengthy one while looking for distantly related homologous proteins is preferred: High specificity: A short signature sequence has a lower chance of matching unrelated proteins in the database since it is more specialized to a certain protein activity. On the other hand, sections of high homology that are not unique to the particular protein function are more likely to be found in long sequences. Less costly computationally: Searching the database with a short sequence costs less computationally than searching with a big sequence. This is so that a shorter sequence may be compared to other sequences in the database more quickly, which can be a laborious process. High sensitivity: Despite being shorter, signature sequences often originate from conserved protein regions that are crucial to the protein's operation. As a result, both more distant and closely related homologs will be recognized by the signature sequence. Short signature sequences are less likely to be impacted by evolutionary divergence since they are generated from conserved sections, making them more susceptible to it. They will be able to recognize homologs even in creatures that are not closely related to them. As a result, employing a short signature sequence is thought to be a more effective approach than using a large sequence when looking for distantly related homologous proteins since it is more specialized, less computationally costly, and more sensitive to evolutionary divergence.
