Searching using a short sequence is preferable to searching with a lengthy sequence because short sequences are more specific and less susceptible to false positives. A longer sequence enhances the likelihood of finding a match, but it also raises the likelihood of discovering a non-homologous sequence with a coincidentally identical sequence. Moreover, a short signature sequence is more likely to be preserved across evolutionarily distant animals, hence increasing the likelihood of discovering distant homologs.
