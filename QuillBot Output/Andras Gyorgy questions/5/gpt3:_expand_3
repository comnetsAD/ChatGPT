When searching, it is best to utilize a short sequence rather than a lengthy sequence since short sequences are more particular and are less likely to produce false positives. Long sequences, on the other hand, are more likely to produce true positives. A longer sequence not only raises the likelihood of finding a homologous match, but also raises the likelihood of discovering a non-homologous sequence that, by coincidence, also has the same sequence. In addition, a short signature sequence is more likely to be preserved among creatures that are quite different from one another in terms of their evolutionary history, which enhances the likelihood of locating distant homologs.
