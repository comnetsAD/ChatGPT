Searching using a short sequence is preferable to searching with a lengthy sequence since the former is more specialized and generates fewer false positives. The likelihood of finding a match improves with sequence length, but so does the likelihood of discovering a non-homologous sequence that has the same sequence by coincidence. The likelihood of locating distant homologs is further increased if the signature sequence is short, since it is more likely to be preserved across creatures with different evolutionary histories.
