In order to find distantly related homologous proteins, it is recommended to use a short signature sequence rather than a lengthy one. High specificity: a short signature sequence is less likely to match with other proteins in the database and is therefore more specific to a certain protein activity. However, areas of high homology that are not unique to the particular protein function are more likely to be present in longer sequences. Database searches that use shorter sequences are computationally cheaper than those that use longer ones. Since it might be laborious to calculate similarities between a given sequence and all the others in the database, a shorter sequence is preferable. Sensitivity at a high level since signature sequences are often generated from highly conserved and functionally important sections of a protein. In this way, the signature sequence may be relied upon to detect both near and distant homologs. Short signature sequences are less likely to be impacted by evolutionary divergence since they are drawn from conserved areas. This will allow them to find homologs in very distantly related species. Because of its greater specificity, lower processing cost, and greater sensitivity to evolutionary divergence, searching for distantly related homologous proteins using a short signature sequence is thought to be a superior technique than utilizing a lengthy sequence.
