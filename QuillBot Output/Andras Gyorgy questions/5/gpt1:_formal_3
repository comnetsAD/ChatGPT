Several factors suggest that searching for distantly related homologous proteins with a short signature sequence is preferable than utilizing a large sequence. A short signature sequence is more unique to a certain protein activity and less likely to match with other proteins in the database. However, long sequences are more likely to include sections of high homology that are not unique to the protein's activity. Utilizing a shorter sequence to search the database is less costly from a computational standpoint than using a longer sequence. This is due to the fact that a shorter sequence needs fewer computations to compare to other sequences in the database, which may be a time-consuming endeavor. High sensitivity: Despite being shorter, signature sequences are often generated from functionally crucial conserved portions of a protein. This guarantees that the signature sequence will recognize both closely related and distant homologs. Because they are formed from conserved areas, small signature sequences are more likely to be influenced by evolutionary divergence than longer signature sequences. This implies that they will be able to find homologs in creatures that are distantly related. In conclusion, it is believed that searching for distantly related homologous proteins using a short signature sequence is preferable than employing a lengthy signature sequence since it is more specific, less computationally costly, and more sensitive to evolutionary divergence.
