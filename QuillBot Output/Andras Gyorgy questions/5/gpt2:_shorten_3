A brief signature sequence indicating protein activity is often used to search the database for distantly related homologous proteins. Since: High selectivity: Short signature sequences are more specific to a protein function and less likely to match non-related proteins in the database. This improves the database's protein hit rate. Cheap computation: Short sequences are computationally cheaper for database searches. Shorter sequences need fewer computations to compare to other database sequences, which might take time. Robustness against mutations: Short signature sequences are frequently produced from conserved protein areas that are less likely to be impacted by mutations, making them better for recognizing homologs. High sensitivity: Signature sequences are generally generated from critical protein domains. Even with alterations, the signature sequence will identify closely related and distant homologs. In conclusion, searching for distantly related homologous proteins using a short signature sequence is more specific, less computationally costly, more resilient to mutations, and more sensitive to evolutionary divergence than using a large sequence.
