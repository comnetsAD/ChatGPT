The cell may be in risk from translating damaged or incomplete mRNAs in a number of ways, including: Proteins that are non-functional or detrimental to cells may be produced when an mRNA is only partially translated. This may result in cellular malfunction or injury. Energy waste: Partial mRNA translation may increase the amount of ineffective translation events, which can eat up a lot of energy and materials that might be put to better use in other vital cellular activities. Partial mRNAs may prevent full-length mRNAs from being translated, which might reduce the amount of functional proteins produced. This could be harmful to the cell, particularly if it affects the proteins involved in vital activities like growth, division, or repair. Inefficient ribosome use: In prokaryotes, partial mRNA translation may result in the formation of unstable ribosomes that have a tendency to separate from the mRNA before it has been fully translated. This can increase the number of truncated proteins, which can result in the formation of misfolded proteins that may be toxic to the cell. An increase in the stress on the proteasome is caused by the shortened proteins that are produced as a result of incomplete mRNA translation and are then targeted for destruction by the proteasome. Translating incomplete mRNAs may result in the creation of truncated proteins that can bind to and incorrectly control the expression of other genes.
