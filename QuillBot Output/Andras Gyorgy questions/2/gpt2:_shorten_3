Broken or incomplete mRNA translation may harm cells: Non-functional or dangerous proteins: A incomplete mRNA may produce a cell-damaging protein. Wasteful energy consumption: Translating incomplete mRNAs may increase non-productive translation events, which waste energy and resources that might be employed for other vital cellular operations. Inhibition of full-length mRNA translation: Partial mRNAs may block the translation of full-length mRNAs, reducing protein synthesis and harming the cell, particularly if proteins crucial in growth, division, or repair are disrupted. Inefficient usage of ribosomes: In prokaryotes, translating partial mRNAs may lead to unstable ribosomes that slip off the mRNA before translating it entirely, resulting in truncated proteins and misfolded proteins that may be hazardous to the organism. Increased proteasome stress: Translating partial mRNAs produces truncated proteins that the proteasome degrades, increasing its stress. Translation of incomplete mRNAs may produce truncated proteins that bind to and misregulate other genes.
