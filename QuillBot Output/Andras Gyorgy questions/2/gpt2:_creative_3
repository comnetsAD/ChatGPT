Numerous risks to the cell arise when incomplete or damaged mRNAs are translated. The protein synthesized from an mRNA fragment may not function properly or may even be toxic to the cell, causing malfunction or injury. Partial mRNA translation may increase the frequency of non-productive translation events, squandering cellular energy and resources that might be employed for more useful operations. Reduced generation of functional proteins is harmful to the cell, particularly if the proteins engaged in crucial activities like growth, division, or repair are impacted by the inhibition of translation of full-length mRNAs by partial mRNAs. Inefficient use of ribosomes: in prokaryotes, translating partial mRNAs may lead to the formation of unstable ribosomes that tend to fall off the mRNA before translating it completely, leading to an increase in the number of truncated proteins, which can lead to the formation of misfolded, toxic proteins. Stress on the proteasome is raised because of the creation of truncated proteins from the translation of partial mRNAs; these proteins are destined for destruction by the proteasome. When just a portion of an mRNA is translated, a truncated protein is produced that may bind to and improperly control the expression of other genes.
