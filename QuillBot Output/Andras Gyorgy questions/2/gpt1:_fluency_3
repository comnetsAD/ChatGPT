Translating damaged or incomplete mRNAs may endanger the cell in a variety of ways. One risk is that the resultant protein will be ineffective or even damaging to the cell. Another risk is that incomplete mRNA translation might increase the frequency of non-productive translation events, which can squander a lot of energy and resources. Furthermore, incomplete mRNAs may hinder full-length mRNA translation, resulting in a reduction in the generation of functional proteins. This may be harmful to the cell, particularly if proteins involved in critical processes like growth, division, or repair are compromised. Furthermore, in prokaryotes, translating partial mRNAs may result in the formation of unstable ribosomes, which tend to fall off the mRNA before fully translating it, resulting in an increase in the number of truncated proteins, which can lead to the formation of misfolded proteins, which can be toxic to the cell.
