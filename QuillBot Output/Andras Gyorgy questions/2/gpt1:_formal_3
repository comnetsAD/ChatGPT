Broken or incomplete mRNA translation poses various threats to the cell. The resultant protein may be nonfunctional or even toxic to the cell, which poses a risk. The translation of incomplete mRNAs may also contribute to a rise in non-productive translation events, which can use a great deal of energy and resources. In addition, incomplete mRNAs may hinder the translation of full-length mRNAs, resulting in a reduction in functional protein synthesis. This may be harmful to the cell, particularly if proteins involved in vital activities such as growth, division, or repair are impacted. Furthermore, in prokaryotes, the translation of partial mRNAs may result in the formation of unstable ribosomes that tend to detach from the mRNA prior to its complete translation. This can lead to an increase in the number of truncated proteins, which can result in the formation of misfolded proteins that are potentially toxic to the cell.
