The cell may be in risk as a result of translating mRNAs that are incomplete or damaged. The possibility that the produced protein won't function or potentially endanger the cell is one risk. Another risk is that the translation of incomplete mRNAs may result in more ineffective translation events, which may waste a lot of time and energy. Additionally, incomplete mRNAs may prevent full-length mRNAs from being translated, which would reduce the amount of functional proteins produced. The cell may suffer as a result, particularly if the proteins necessary for vital functions like growth, division, or repair are compromised. Additionally, in prokaryotes, incomplete mRNA translation may result in unstable ribosomes that tend to separate from the mRNA before it is fully translated. This can increase the production of truncated proteins, which can result in the generation of misfolded proteins that can be hazardous to cells.
