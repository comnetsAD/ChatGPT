The cell faces many risks while translating imperfect or missing mRNAs. The risk is that the protein produced is either useless or potentially toxic to the cell. Partial mRNA translation poses an additional threat since it may increase the amount of non-productive translation events, which can be very costly. Partial mRNAs may also prevent the translation of full-length mRNAs, resulting in a reduction in the generation of functional proteins. If this happens to proteins involved in crucial cellular functions like growth, division, or repair, it might have a negative impact on the cell. An increase in the amount of truncated proteins, which may lead to the creation of misfolded protein that can be hazardous to the cell, has been linked to the translation of incomplete mRNAs in prokaryotes.
