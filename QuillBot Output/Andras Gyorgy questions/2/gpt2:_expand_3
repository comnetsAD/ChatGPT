The translation of damaged or incomplete mRNAs may be harmful to the cell in a number of ways, including the following: Proteins that are either non-functional or dangerous to the cell: If a cell only receives a portion of its mRNA, the protein that is produced may be either non-functional or even toxic to the cell. This may result in malfunction or damage to the cell. Consumption of unnecessary amounts of energy: The process of translating partial mRNAs can result in an increase in the number of non-productive translation events, which can use up a significant amount of energy and resources that the cell could be putting to better use for other, more essential processes. Inhibition of the translation of full-length mRNA Partial mRNAs have the potential to inhibit the translation of full-length mRNAs, which can result in a decrease in the production of functional proteins. This can be harmful to the cell, particularly if proteins that are involved in essential processes like growth, division, or repair are impacted. Inefficient use of ribosomes: In prokaryotes, translating partial mRNAs can lead to the formation of unstable ribosomes, which have a tendency to fall off the mRNA before completely translating it. This can lead to an increase in the number of truncated proteins, which can lead to the formation of misfolded protein, which can be harmful to the cell. Inefficient use of ribosomes can also lead to the formation of misfolded protein, Increase in the amount of stress placed on the proteasome as a result of the formation of truncated proteins as a result of the translation of partial mRNAs. Since truncated proteins are targeted for degradation by the proteasome, this results in an increase in the amount of stress placed on the proteasome. Incorrect regulation of gene expression may result from the translation of incomplete mRNAs, which can then lead to the creation of truncated proteins that can bind to other genes and inadvertently alter their expression.
