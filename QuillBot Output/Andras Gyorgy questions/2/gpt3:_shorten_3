Broken or incomplete mRNA translation may harm cells: Truncated or non-functional proteins: A partial mRNA may not have all the coding regions needed to make a full and functioning protein. Partial mRNAs may compete with full-length mRNAs for translation resources, reducing functional protein output. Increased protein synthesis mistakes: Partial mRNAs may cause protein synthesis errors, resulting in non-functional or toxic proteins. Misregulation of gene expression: Translating incomplete mRNAs produces truncated proteins that bind to and misregulate other genes. Increased burden on quality control equipment: Translation of incomplete mRNAs may produce non-functional proteins that need quality control mechanisms like the proteasome.
