Broken or incomplete mRNA translation poses a number of threats to the cell, including: Nonfunctional or hazardous proteins: The protein produced by a partial mRNA may be nonfunctional or even detrimental to the cell, resulting in malfunction or injury. Translation of incomplete mRNAs may result in an increase in the frequency of non-productive translation events, which can waste a great deal of energy and resources that might be utilized for other essential cellular operations. Inhibition of full-length mRNA translation: Partial mRNAs may inhibit the translation of full-length mRNAs, resulting in a decrease in the production of functional proteins, which can be detrimental to the cell, particularly if proteins involved in essential cellular processes such as growth, division, or repair are inhibited. Inefficient use of ribosomes: In prokaryotes, translating partial mRNAs can lead to the formation of unstable ribosomes that tend to fall off the mRNA before translating it completely. This can lead to an increase in the number of truncated proteins, which can result in the formation of misfolded proteins that are potentially toxic to the cell. Increase in proteasome stress: Translation of incomplete mRNAs results in the creation of truncated proteins that are targeted for destruction by the proteasome, hence increasing proteasome stress. Translation of incomplete mRNAs may result in the production of truncated proteins that can bind to and misregulate the expression of other genes.
