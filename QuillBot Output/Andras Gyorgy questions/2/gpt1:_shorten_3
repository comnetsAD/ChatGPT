Broken or incomplete mRNA translation may harm cells. The protein may be non-functional or detrimental to the cell. Partial mRNA translation may increase non-productive translation events, which waste energy and resources. Partial mRNAs may also hinder full-length mRNA translation, reducing functional protein output. If growth, division, or repair proteins are impaired, this may harm the cell. In prokaryotes, translating incomplete mRNAs may cause unstable ribosomes to slip off the mRNA before translating it, resulting in an increase in truncated proteins and misfolded proteins that may be hazardous to the organism.
