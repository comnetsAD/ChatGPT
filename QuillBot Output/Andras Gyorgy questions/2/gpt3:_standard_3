The cell may be in risk from translating damaged or incomplete mRNAs in a number of ways, including: Production of incomplete or non-functional proteins: A partial mRNA could lack some of the coding sequences required to make a whole, functional protein, which might result in the production of incomplete or non-functional proteins. Partial mRNAs may compete with full-length mRNAs for translational resources, inhibiting the translation of full-length mRNAs and reducing the generation of functional proteins. An increase in protein synthesis mistakes may be caused by the existence of incomplete mRNAs, which can result in the creation of undesirable or dangerous proteins. Translation of incomplete mRNAs may result in the creation of truncated proteins that can bind to and incorrectly control the expression of other genes. Stress on the quality control system is increased because incomplete mRNA translation may result in the creation of non-functional proteins that need the proteasome and other quality control systems to operate.
