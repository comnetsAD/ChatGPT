Translation of damaged or incomplete mRNAs may endanger the cell in numerous ways, including: Production of truncated or non-functional proteins: Because a partial mRNA may lack all of the essential coding sequences to make a full and functional protein, truncated or non-functional proteins are formed. Inhibition of full-length mRNA translation: Partial mRNAs may compete for translation resources with full-length mRNAs, resulting in a reduction in the generation of functional proteins. Increased protein synthesis mistakes: The presence of incomplete mRNAs may cause errors in protein synthesis, resulting in the creation of non-functional or dangerous proteins. Misregulation of gene expression: When incomplete mRNAs are translated, truncated proteins are formed, which may bind to and misregulate the expression of other genes. Increased stress on the quality control machinery: Partial mRNA translation may result in the creation of non-functional proteins that need the activity of quality control machinery such as the proteasome, putting additional strain on this equipment.
