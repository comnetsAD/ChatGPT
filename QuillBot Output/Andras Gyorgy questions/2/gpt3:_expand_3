The synthesis of truncated or non-functional proteins may occur when a partial mRNA does not include all of the essential coding regions to make a full and functional protein. This can result in the production of proteins that are either truncated or that do not function properly. Inhibition of the translation of full-length mRNA may occur when partial mRNAs compete with full-length mRNAs for the resources necessary for translation. This can result in a reduction in the amount of functional proteins produced. Increase in the number of errors that occur during the process of protein synthesis The presence of partial mRNAs can lead to an increase in the number of errors that occur during the process of protein synthesis, which can result in the formation of proteins that are either non-functional or harmful. Incorrect control of gene expression may result from the translation of incomplete mRNAs, which can lead to the creation of truncated proteins that can bind to other genes and inadvertently alter their expression. Increase in the amount of stress placed on the machinery used for quality control The translation of partial mRNAs can result in the formation of non-functional proteins, which need the action of the machinery used for quality control, such as the proteasome. This results in an increase in the amount of stress placed on the machinery used for quality control.
