Translation of damaged or incomplete mRNAs may endanger the cell in numerous ways, including: Non-functional or hazardous proteins: The protein formed as a consequence of a partial mRNA may be non-functional or even detrimental to the cell, resulting in cellular malfunction or injury. Energy waste: Partial mRNA translation may increase the frequency of non-productive translation events, which can drain a lot of energy and resources that might be utilized for other critical cellular operations. Inhibition of full-length mRNA translation: Partial mRNAs may inhibit full-length mRNA translation, resulting in a decrease in the production of functional proteins, which can be harmful to the cell, especially if proteins involved in essential processes such as growth, division, or repair are affected. Inefficient use of ribosomes: In prokaryotes, translating partial mRNAs may result in the formation of unstable ribosomes, which tend to fall off the mRNA before fully translating it. This can result in an increase in the number of truncated proteins, which can lead to the formation of misfolded proteins, which can be toxic to the cell. Increased proteasome stress: Translation of incomplete mRNAs results in the creation of truncated proteins that are targeted for destruction by the proteasome, increasing proteasome stress. Translation of incomplete mRNAs may result in the production of truncated proteins that can bind to and misregulate the expression of other genes.
