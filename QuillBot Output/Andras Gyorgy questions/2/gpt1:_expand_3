The translation of flawed or incomplete mRNAs may be harmful to the cell in a number of ways. One of the potential risks is that the protein that is produced may not function properly or may even be damaging to the cell. Another potential risk is that the translation of incomplete mRNAs may result in a rise in the number of translation events that are not productive. These events may use up a significant amount of energy and other resources. In addition, the generation of functional proteins is hindered when incomplete mRNAs block the translation of full-length mRNAs, which leads to a reduction in overall protein output. This may be harmful to the cell, particularly if the proteins that are involved in vital activities like growth, division, or repair are impacted. Additionally, the process of translating partial mRNAs can lead to the formation of unstable ribosomes in prokaryotic cells. These ribosomes have a tendency to fall off the mRNA before the process of translating it in its entirety is finished. This can result in an increase in the number of truncated proteins, which can lead to the formation of misfolded protein, which can be harmful to the cell.
