Broken or incomplete mRNA translation poses a number of threats to the cell, including: A partial mRNA may lack the required coding sequences to make a full and functional protein, resulting in the production of truncated or non-functional proteins. Inhibition of full-length mRNA translation: Partial mRNAs may compete with full-length mRNAs for translation resources, resulting in a reduction in functional protein output. The existence of incomplete mRNAs may lead to an increase in mistakes in protein synthesis, which can result in the creation of nonfunctional or dangerous proteins. Translation of incomplete mRNAs may result in the production of truncated proteins that can bind to and misregulate the expression of other genes. Translation of incomplete mRNAs may result in the creation of non-functional proteins that need the activity of quality control machinery such as the proteasome, hence increasing the load on this mechanism.
