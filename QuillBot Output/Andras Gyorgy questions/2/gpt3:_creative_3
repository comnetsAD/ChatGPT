Numerous risks to the cell arise when incomplete or damaged mRNAs are translated. Partial mRNAs may lack some of the coding areas required to generate a full and functional protein, resulting to the generation of proteins that are either incomplete or dysfunctional. Reduced protein function due to competition for translational resources between complete and partial mRNAs. Errors in protein synthesis are more likely to occur when incomplete mRNAs are present, which may lead to the production of proteins that are either ineffective or even dangerous. When just a portion of an mRNA is translated, a truncated protein is produced that may bind to and incorrectly control the expression of other genes. Translation of incomplete mRNAs may result in the production of non-functional proteins that must be eliminated by the action of quality control machinery like the proteasome, hence increasing the workload of these systems.
