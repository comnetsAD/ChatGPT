According to the second rule of thermodynamics, systems will inevitably tend to become more disordered or entropic. However, since living things always retain a high level of order and organization, it would seem that they go against this idea. As living beings are able to preserve their ordered condition by a process known as "dissipative structures," which is a way to maintain order by dissipating energy from the environment, this seeming violation of the second law is not a true violation. Self-organizing systems known as dissipative structures utilise energy from the environment to maintain their internal structure and carry out metabolic functions. This enables living things to persist in a low-entropy steady state in spite of the second law of thermodynamics. A low-entropy condition can be maintained within a live body since they are not isolated systems and can absorb energy from their surroundings. This is feasible because living things are open systems that may exchange matter and energy with their surroundings, in contrast to closed systems to which the second law of thermodynamics only applies. In conclusion, living things are open systems that can exchange matter and energy with the environment, which makes them fully compatible with the laws of thermodynamics. They are able to maintain their ordered state through the process of dissipative structures, which allows them to take in energy from the environment and use it to maintain internal organization and carry out metabolic processes.
