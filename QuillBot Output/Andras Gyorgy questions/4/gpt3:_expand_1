According to the second rule of thermodynamics, systems tend to evolve toward a more disordered, or high-entropy, state. However, living beings seem to defy this idea, as they keep a very high level of order and organization despite their chaotic nature. Living creatures are able to keep their order by a mechanism known as "dissipative structures," which is a way to maintain order by dissipating energy from the environment, therefore this seeming violation of the second law is not a true violation. Self-sustaining and metabolic, dissipative structures absorb energy from their surroundings and utilise it to maintain internal order. This allows living things to defy the second rule of thermodynamics by remaining in a state of relatively low entropy. Furthermore, living beings are not closed systems; they are able to draw energy from their surroundings, which helps them to stay in a state of low entropy. To explain how this is possible, consider that the second law of thermodynamics only applies to closed systems, but living organisms are open systems that may exchange matter and energy with their surroundings. As open systems that can exchange matter and energy with the environment, living organisms are perfectly consistent with the laws of thermodynamics, and their ordered state is maintained by the process of dissipative structures that allow them to take in energy from the environment and use it to maintain internal organization and carry out metabolic processes.
