According to the second rule of thermodynamics, systems always evolve to more disordered states (disorder). Nonetheless, biological systems are extremely organized, which seems to go against this rule. Living systems are entirely consistent with the principles of thermodynamics, thus this seeming contradiction is not a violation at all. Knowing that biological systems are open systems that interchange matter and energy with their surrounds is the key to making sense of this seeming contradiction. They take in food as a source of energy and material, which they then employ to build and maintain their structures and run their metabolic processes. By producing heat and other byproducts, they contribute to an increase in the entropy of their environment. Entropy rises outside of the living system and outweighs its fall inside it because of the existence of the system. Furthermore, the second rule of thermodynamics stipulates that entropy can never decrease in an isolated system. On the other hand, biological systems are not closed systems; they may draw energy from their surroundings, which keeps the organism's internal entropy low. In conclusion, living systems do not contradict the second rule of thermodynamics because they are open systems that constantly transfer matter and energy to and from their environment. Collectively, the entropy of all biological systems and their environment rises.
