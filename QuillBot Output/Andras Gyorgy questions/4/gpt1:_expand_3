According to the second rule of thermodynamics, systems will always move inexorably toward more disorderly configurations if left to their own devices (disorder). On the other hand, biological systems often seem to have a high level of order, which seems to go against this concept. As biological systems are completely consistent with the principles of thermodynamics, this seeming breach does not represent an actual violation of the laws. Realizing that biological systems are open systems that engage in the interchange of matter and energy with their surrounds is essential to gaining a grasp of this seeming contradiction. They do this by taking in energy and substance in the form of food, which they then utilize to arrange their components and carry out the metabolic activities that are necessary for survival. They achieve this by producing heat and waste products, which both contribute to an increase in the entropy of their environment. The rise in entropy that is induced by the living system as a whole, which takes into account the system as well as the environment in which it exists, is larger than the reduction in entropy that occurs inside the living system itself. In addition, the second law of thermodynamics stipulates that the amount of entropy in a system that is kept to itself can never increase. Living systems, on the other hand, are not isolated systems; rather, they are able to draw energy from their surroundings, which enables them to keep their internal state of entropy at a relatively low level. In conclusion, living systems do not contradict the second rule of thermodynamics because they are open systems that constantly interchange matter and energy with their surrounds. An overall rise in entropy may be attributed to the fact that the entropy of both living systems and their environments, when considered together, rises.
