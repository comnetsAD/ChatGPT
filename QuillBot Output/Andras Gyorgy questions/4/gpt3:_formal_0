The second law of thermodynamics states that all systems tend toward greater entropy or disorder. However, living organisms appear to defy this principle because they maintain a high level of order and organization. This apparent violation of the second law is not actually a violation, as living organisms are able to maintain their ordered state through a process known as "dissipative structures," which maintain order by dissipating energy from their surroundings. Dissipative structures are self-organizing systems that absorb energy from their surroundings and use it to maintain their internal order and conduct metabolic processes. Despite the second law of thermodynamics, this enables living organisms to maintain a constant state of low entropy. In addition, living organisms are not isolated systems and are capable of extracting energy from their surroundings, allowing them to maintain a low entropy state. The second law of thermodynamics only applies to closed systems, whereas living organisms are open systems that can exchange matter and energy with their surroundings. In conclusion, living organisms are able to maintain their ordered state through the process of dissipative structures, which allows them to take in energy from the environment and use it to maintain internal organization and carry out metabolic processes, and they are open systems that can exchange matter and energy with the environment, which makes them fully compatible with the laws of thermodynamics.
