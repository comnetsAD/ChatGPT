The second rule of thermodynamics asserts that systems will tend to increase in entropy, or disorder. Living creatures, on the other hand, seem to defy this notion by maintaining a high level of order and structure. This seeming breach of the second rule is not a real violation since living creatures may retain their ordered state by using a mechanism known as "dissipative structures," which is a method of maintaining order by dissipating energy from the environment. Dissipative structures are self-organizing systems that absorb energy from their surroundings and utilize it to keep their internal order and metabolic processes running. Despite the second rule of thermodynamics, this permits living creatures to maintain a constant state of low entropy. Furthermore, living creatures are not isolated systems and may drain energy from their surroundings, enabling the organism to maintain a low-entropy condition. Because the second rule of thermodynamics only applies to closed systems, living creatures are open systems that may interchange matter and energy with their surroundings. In summary, living organisms can maintain their ordered state through the process of dissipative structures, which allows them to take in energy from their surroundings and use it to maintain internal organization and carry out metabolic processes, and they are open systems that can exchange matter and energy with their surroundings, making them fully compatible with thermodynamic laws.
