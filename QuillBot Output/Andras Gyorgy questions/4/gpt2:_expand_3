Living things are able to keep themselves in an ordered condition because they are continually taking in energy and matter from their surrounds and using this ingested material and energy to carry out metabolic activities and maintain their internal structure. This phenomenon is referred to as negative entropy or negentropy, and it describes the capacity of biological systems to preserve order and complexity by drawing energy from their surroundings and putting it to use. According to the second rule of thermodynamics, the amount of entropy, or disorder, that exists in a closed system will always rise as time passes. Living systems, on the other hand, are open systems that are capable of exchanging matter and energy with their environment. This allows living systems to sustain a stable state with a low entropy even though they are open systems. In addition, the second rule of thermodynamics can only be applied to closed systems where there is no change in the amount of entropy. The living species that can be found on Earth are a part of an open system, and the sun is the source of the energy that allows these organisms to continue their existence and even grow. The energy that comes from the sun is what drives the process of photosynthesis in plants, which serves as the foundation of the food chain for all living things. In conclusion, living systems are able to keep their ordered state by continuously taking in energy and matter from their surroundings and utilizing it to sustain their internal organization and carry out metabolic processes. While the second law of thermodynamics only applies to closed systems where the entropy is constant, the Earth and all of its living organisms are part of an open system, which makes it fully compatible with the laws of thermodynamics.
