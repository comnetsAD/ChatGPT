The second rule of thermodynamics asserts that systems naturally move toward higher entropy (disorder). Living systems look extremely ordered, violating this rule. Living systems comply with thermodynamics, hence this seeming breach is not real. Living systems exchange matter and energy with their environment, which explains this contradiction. They utilize food for energy and metabolism. They release heat and waste, increasing entropy. The living system and its surroundings create entropy more than the system itself. The second rule of thermodynamics asserts that isolated systems cannot reduce entropy. Living systems may drain energy from their surroundings to maintain a low-entropy condition. Living systems exchange matter and energy with their environment, therefore they do not contradict the second rule of thermodynamics. Together, biological systems and their environment promote entropy.
