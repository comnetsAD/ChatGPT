Maintaining their internal order and carrying out metabolic activities requires living systems to continuously take in energy and matter from their environment. Negentropy, the capacity of biological systems to retain order and complexity by absorbing and harnessing energy from their surroundings, describes this process. According to the second rule of thermodynamics, entropy (disorder) in a closed system constantly increases with time. Living systems, on the other hand, are open systems that can interchange matter and energy with their surrounds, enabling them to keep their entropy low indefinitely. The second rule of thermodynamics is also restricted to closed systems with a constant entropy. The sun provides the energy necessary for all life on Earth to exist and flourish since the Earth and all its inhabitants are part of a closed system. Sunlight powers the process of photosynthesis in plants, which in turn supports all other forms of life. While the second law of thermodynamics only applies to closed systems where the entropy is constant, the Earth and all of its living organisms are part of an open system and are therefore fully compatible with the laws of thermodynamics.
