According to the second law of thermodynamics, all systems will eventually arrive at a point where there is a higher level of entropy, often known as disorder. However, living beings seem to go against this idea since they have a high degree of order and structure in their systems. Because living beings are able to keep their ordered condition by a mechanism known as "dissipative structures," which is a means to preserve order by dissipating energy from the environment, this seeming violation of the second rule is not a real violation of the second law. Dissipative structures are self-organizing systems that take in energy from their surroundings, utilize that energy to carry out metabolic activities, and then release the energy back into their surroundings. In spite of the second rule of thermodynamics, this makes it possible for living creatures to keep themselves in a constant state of low entropy. In addition, living creatures are not closed systems; rather, they are able to draw energy from their surroundings, which allows for a state of low entropy to be maintained inside the organism itself. The second rule of thermodynamics only applies to closed systems, but living creatures are open systems that are able to interchange matter and energy with their surroundings, hence this is not a problem for them. They are open systems that are able to exchange matter and energy with the environment, which makes them fully compatible with the laws of thermodynamics. In conclusion, living organisms are able to maintain their ordered state through the process of dissipative structures, which allows them to take in energy from the environment and use it to maintain internal organization and carry out metabolic processes.
