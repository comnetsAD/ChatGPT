Living systems need energy and matter from their surrounds to maintain their internal structure and metabolic activities. Negentropy is the capacity of biological systems to sustain order and complexity by absorbing and using energy from their surroundings. The second rule of thermodynamics asserts that closed systems always increase entropy (disorder). However, open living systems may exchange matter and energy with their surrounds to maintain low entropy. The second law of thermodynamics only applies to closed, constant-entropy systems. In an open system, the sun gives life on Earth. All living things depend on photosynthesis, which is powered by the sun. In summary, living systems maintain their ordered state by constantly taking in energy and matter from their surroundings and using it to sustain their internal organization and carry out metabolic processes. The second law of thermodynamics only applies to closed systems where the entropy is constant, but the Earth and its living organisms are part of an open system, making it compatible with the laws.
