The second rule of thermodynamics asserts that systems will naturally shift toward more entropic configurations (disorder). However, biological systems tend to be highly organized, which appears to be in violation of this rule. This seeming infringement is not an actual violation since biological systems are perfectly consistent with thermodynamic rules. Recognizing that biological systems are open systems that interchange matter and energy with their surrounds is the key to comprehending this seeming contradiction. They consume energy and substance in the form of food, which they then utilize to arrange their constituents and carry out metabolic operations. By generating heat and waste products, they enhance the entropy of their environment. The total rise in entropy induced by the living system, which includes both the system and its surroundings, exceeds the reduction in entropy inside the system. Furthermore, the second rule of thermodynamics stipulates that in an isolated system, entropy can never decrease. However, biological systems are not isolated systems and may drain energy from their surroundings, enabling the organism to maintain a low-entropy condition. To summarize, living systems do not contradict the second rule of thermodynamics because they are open systems that interchange matter and energy with their surrounds. The entropy of living systems and their environment rises concurrently, resulting in a net increase in entropy.
