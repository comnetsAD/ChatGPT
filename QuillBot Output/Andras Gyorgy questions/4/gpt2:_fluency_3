Living systems may retain their ordered state by continually absorbing energy and matter from their surrounds and use it to support their internal organization and metabolic activities. This is known as negative entropy or negentropy, and it relates to biological systems' capacity to sustain order and complexity by absorbing and using energy from their surroundings. The second rule of thermodynamics asserts that in a closed system, entropy (disorder) will always rise with time. Living systems, on the other hand, are open systems that can interchange matter and energy with their environment, enabling them to maintain a constant state of low entropy. Furthermore, the second rule of thermodynamics only applies to closed systems with constant entropy. The Earth and its inhabitants are part of an open system in which the sun provides energy for the living species to exist and grow. The sun's energy powers the photosynthesis process in plants, which serves as the foundation of the food chain for all living species. In summary, while the second law of thermodynamics only applies to closed systems with constant entropy, the Earth and its living organisms are part of an open system, making it fully compatible with thermodynamic laws.
