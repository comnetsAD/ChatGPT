The second rule of thermodynamics asserts that systems will naturally evolve toward larger entropy states (disorder). Nonetheless, biological systems tend to be extremely organized, which seems to contradict this rule. As biological systems are perfectly consistent with the principles of thermodynamics, this seeming infringement is not a violation at all. Living systems are open systems that interchange matter and energy with their surrounds; this is the key to comprehending this seeming contradiction. They use food to arrange their components and carry out metabolic operations. By generating heat and waste products, they enhance the entropy of their environment. The rise in entropy induced by the living system and its environment is larger than the reduction in entropy inside the system itself. In addition, the second rule of thermodynamics stipulates that the entropy of an isolated system can never decrease. However, biological systems are not isolated and are capable of extracting energy from their surroundings, enabling the organism to maintain a low entropy state. Living systems do not contradict the second rule of thermodynamics because they are open systems that interchange matter and energy with their environment. Together, the entropy of living systems and their environment grows, resulting in a net increase in entropy.
