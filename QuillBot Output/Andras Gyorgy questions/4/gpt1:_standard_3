According to the second rule of thermodynamics, systems will naturally shift toward configurations that have more entropy (disorder). Living systems, on the other hand, tend to be highly organized, which would seem to go against this concept. Given that biological systems are completely consistent with the principles of thermodynamics, this seeming violation is not really one. Comprehending that biological systems are open systems that interchange matter and energy with their surrounds is the key to understanding this seeming contradiction. They consume food, which contains both energy and substance, and utilize it to assemble their parts and carry out metabolic functions. They achieve this by emitting heat and waste, which raises the entropy of their environment. The reduction in entropy inside the system itself is less than the total rise in entropy brought on by the living system, which includes the system and its surroundings. Additionally, entropy can never decrease in an isolated system, according to the second rule of thermodynamics. Although they are not isolated systems, living things may draw energy from their surroundings, which enables them to maintain a low-entropy internal environment. In conclusion, because biological systems are open systems that interchange matter and energy with their environment, the second rule of thermodynamics is not broken by them. Entropy grows as a consequence of both the entropy of living systems and the environment as a whole.
