The second rule of thermodynamics asserts that systems tend toward disorder, or entropy. However, living beings are highly ordered and organized. Living creatures use "dissipative structures" to preserve order by dissipating energy from the environment. Self-organizing dissipative structures employ environmental energy to sustain order and metabolic activities. Despite the second rule of thermodynamics, living creatures retain minimal entropy. Living creatures may take energy from their surroundings, maintaining a low-entropy condition. Because the second rule of thermodynamics only applies to closed systems, living beings may exchange matter and energy with the environment. In summary, dissipative structures allow living organisms to take energy from the environment and use it to maintain internal organization and metabolic processes. They are open systems that can exchange matter and energy with the environment, making them fully compatible with the laws of thermodynamics.
