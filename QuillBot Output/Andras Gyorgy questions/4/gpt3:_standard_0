According to the second law of thermodynamics, systems will inevitably tend to become more disordered or entropic. However, since living things consistently maintain a high level of order and organization, it would seem that they go against this principle. As living organisms are able to maintain their ordered state through a process known as "dissipative structures," which is a way to maintain order by dissipating energy from the environment, this apparent violation of the second law is not a true violation. Self-organizing systems known as dissipative structures use energy from the environment to maintain their internal structure and carry out metabolic functions. This enables living things to persist in a low-entropy steady state in spite of the second law of thermodynamics. A low-entropy state can be maintained within a living organism because they are not isolated systems and can absorb energy from their surroundings. This is possible because living things are open systems that can exchange matter and energy with their surroundings, in contrast to closed systems to which the second law of thermodynamics only applies. In conclusion, living things are open systems that can exchange matter and energy with the environment, which makes them fully compatible with the laws of thermodynamics. They are able to maintain their ordered state through the process of dissipative structures, which allows them to take in energy from the environment and use it to maintain internal organization and carry out metabolic processes.
