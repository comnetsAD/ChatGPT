According to the second rule of thermodynamics, systems tend to evolve toward a more disordered, or high-entropy, state. However, living beings seem to defy this idea, since they maintain a very high level of order and structure despite their chaotic nature. Self-sustaining and metabolic, dissipative structures absorb energy from their surroundings and utilise it to maintain internal order. This permits living things to defy the second rule of thermodynamics by remaining in a state of relatively low entropy. To explain how this is possible, consider that the second rule of thermodynamics only applies to closed systems, but living beings are open systems that may interchange matter and energy with their surroundings. As open systems that can exchange matter and energy with the environment, living organisms are perfectly consistent with the laws of thermodynamics, and their ordered state is maintained by the process of dissipative structures that allow them to take in energy from the environment and use it to maintain internal organization and carry out metabolic processes.
