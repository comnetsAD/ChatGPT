Living systems are able to retain their ordered state by continuously absorbing energy and matter from their environment and use it to maintain their internal structure and conduct metabolic activities. Negentropy or negative entropy refers to the capacity of biological systems to sustain order and complexity by absorbing and using energy from their surroundings. The second law of thermodynamics asserts that in a closed system, entropy (disorder) will always rise with time. However, biological systems are open systems that may interchange matter and energy with their environment, enabling them to retain a low entropy state. In addition, the second rule of thermodynamics only applies to closed systems with constant entropy. The Earth and its living species are part of an open system in which the sun provides the energy necessary for the organisms' survival and growth. The photosynthesis process in plants, which is the base of the food chain for all living species, is powered by solar energy. While the second law of thermodynamics only applies to closed systems in which entropy is constant, the Earth and its living organisms are part of an open system, making them fully compatible with the laws of thermodynamics.
