The second rule of thermodynamics holds that all systems tend toward increased entropy or chaos. However, living beings appear to defy this idea since they maintain a high level of order and organization. This seeming breach of the second rule is not actually a violation, since living creatures are able to retain their ordered condition through a mechanism known as "dissipative structures," which preserve order by dissipating energy from their surroundings. Dissipative structures are self-organizing systems that absorb energy from their surroundings and use it to maintain their internal order and conduct metabolic activities. Despite the second rule of thermodynamics, this enables living creatures to maintain a constant state of low entropy. In addition, living beings are not isolated systems and are capable of extracting energy from their surroundings, allowing them to maintain a low entropy condition. The second rule of thermodynamics only applies to closed systems, but living creatures are open systems that may interchange matter and energy with their surroundings. In conclusion, living organisms are able to maintain their ordered state through the process of dissipative structures, which allows them to take in energy from the environment and use it to maintain internal organization and carry out metabolic processes, and they are open systems that can exchange matter and energy with the environment, which makes them fully compatible with the laws of thermodynamics.
