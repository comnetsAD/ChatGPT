Living systems are capable of sustaining their internal structure and carrying out metabolic activities by continuously ingesting energy and materials from their environment. The capacity of biological systems to retain order and complexity by absorbing and using energy from their surroundings is known as negative entropy, also known as negentropy. Entropy (disorder), according to the second rule of thermodynamics, will constantly rise over time in a closed system. Living systems, on the other hand, are open systems that may interchange matter and energy with their environment, enabling them to sustain a constant state of low entropy. Furthermore, only closed systems with constant entropy are subject to the second rule of thermodynamics. The sun provides energy for the living things on Earth, allowing them to exist and grow in an open system that includes both the Earth and the living things that inhabit it. The process of photosynthesis, which is the foundation of the food chain for all living things, is powered by the sun's energy. In conclusion, while the second law of thermodynamics only applies to closed systems where the entropy is constant, the Earth and its living organisms are part of an open system, making them fully compatible with the laws of thermodynamics. Living systems are able to maintain their ordered state by continuously absorbing energy and matter from their surroundings and using it to sustain their internal organization and carry out metabolic processes.
