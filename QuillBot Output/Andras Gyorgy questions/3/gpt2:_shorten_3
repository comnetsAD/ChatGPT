DNA base pairing underpinned Erwin Chargaff's findings. DNA pairs A with T and C with G. Due to base pairing, double-stranded DNA has equal mole percents of G, C, A, and T. Chargaff's regulations depend on this nucleotide connection. Some DNA samples defy Chargaff's guidelines. In the single-stranded DNA of the virus FX174, A=24, C=22, G=23, and T=31. Single-stranded DNA has fewer base-pairing limitations than double-stranded DNA, enabling nucleotide composition changes. Chargaff's criteria were based on DNA measurements from several creatures, and DNA base composition may vary across and within species.
