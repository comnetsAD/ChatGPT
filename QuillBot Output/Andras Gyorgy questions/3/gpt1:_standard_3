The base pairing concept of DNA structure is the basis for Erwin Chargaff's finding that the mole percents of G and C, as well as the mole percents of A and T, are equal in DNA samples from a variety of animals. Adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G) are the four nucleotides that make up DNA, and they always couple up in a certain way: A with T, and C with G. As a result, there must be a T for every A and a G for every C in the DNA. The structure on which Chargaff's laws are based is the connection between the nucleotides. Not all DNA samples, meanwhile, abide with Chargaff's guidelines. The mole percents are not identical in the single-stranded DNA of the virus FX174 because A=24, C=22, G=23, and T=31. This is so that alterations in the nucleotide composition are possible as single-stranded DNA does not have the base-pairing restrictions that double-stranded DNA does. Because the genome of the virus FX174 is single-stranded DNA, it defies the laws. Because base-pairing is not a constraint in single-stranded DNA, a wider range of nucleotides may be used.
