The crucial finding by Erwin Chargaff was that the mole percents of G and C in double-stranded DNA are equal, as well as the mole percents of A and T. This is because DNA follows certain base-pairing principles, which pair A with T and C with G. This rule is not absolute and does not hold true for all DNA samples, such as single-stranded DNA found in the genome of the virus FX174, where the mole percents are A=24, C=22, G=23, and T=31. Variations in the nucleotide makeup are possible because single-stranded DNA does not have the base-pairing restrictions that double-stranded DNA has. DNA base makeup may also differ across species as well as within a single species.
