Erwin Chargaff discovered that the mole percent of G in double-stranded DNA is equal to the mole percent of C, and the mole percents of A and T are equal. This is owing to DNA's unique base-pairing regulations, which pair A with T and C with G. However, this rule is not general and does not apply to all DNA samples, such as single-stranded DNA, such as the genome of the virus FX174, where the mole percents are A=24, C=22, G=23, and T=31. Because single-stranded DNA lacks the base-pairing limitations of double-stranded DNA, it allows for nucleotide composition changes. Furthermore, the base makeup of DNA may change across species as well as within the same species.
