The findings of Erwin Chargaff were based on the base pairing concept of DNA structure. The four nucleotides (adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine) in DNA are paired in a precise order: A with T, and C with G. This base pairing results in the finding that the mole percent of G in double-stranded DNA is equal to the mole percent of C, and the mole percents of A and T are equal. The structural foundation for Chargaff's laws is the interaction between the nucleotides. However, not all DNA samples adhere to Chargaff's guidelines. For example, the mole percents of A, C, G, and T in the single-stranded DNA of the virus FX174 are not equal, with A=24, C=22, G=23, and T=31. This is due to the fact that single-stranded DNA lacks the base-pairing limitations that double-stranded DNA possesses, allowing for variances in nucleotide composition. Furthermore, Chargaff's guidelines were based on DNA measurements from a diverse variety of creatures, and the base makeup of DNA may change across species as well as within the same species.
