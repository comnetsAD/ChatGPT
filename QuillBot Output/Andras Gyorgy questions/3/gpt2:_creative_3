Erwin Chargaff's findings relied on the base-pairing concept found in DNA. Adenine and thymine, cytosine and guanine, and the other two nucleotides are paired off in DNA in precise ways. Because of this base pairing, it has been shown that the proportion of G to C and A to T in double-stranded DNA is also balanced. Chargaff's guidelines have a structural foundation in the interaction between the nucleotides. On the other hand, not all DNA samples follow Chargaff's guidelines. The mole percentages of A, C, G, and T are not identical; in the single-stranded DNA of the virus FX174, for instance, A=24, C=22, G=23, and T=31. This is because differences in nucleotide composition are more easily accommodated in single-stranded DNA than in double-stranded DNA due to the lack of base-pairing limitations in the former. And because Chargaff's principles relied on measurements of DNA from many various kinds of creatures, and since DNA's base makeup may change both across and within species, it's possible that they're not universal.
