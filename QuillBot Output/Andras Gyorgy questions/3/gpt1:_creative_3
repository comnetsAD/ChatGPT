Based on the base pairing concept of DNA structure, Erwin Chargaff found that the percentage of G in DNA samples from a broad variety of creatures is equal to the percentage of C, and that the percentages of A and T are also identical. Adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G) are the four nucleotides that make up DNA; they always couple up in the same way: A with T, and C with G. Therefore, there must be a G and a T in the DNA for every C and A, respectively. Chargaff's guidelines have a structural foundation in the interaction between the nucleotides. On the other hand, not all DNA samples follow Chargaff's guidelines. A=24, C=22, G=23, and T=31 make up the single-stranded DNA of virus FX174, although these mole percentages are not uniform. This is because differences in nucleotide composition are more easily accommodated in single-stranded DNA than in double-stranded DNA due to the lack of base-pairing limitations in the former. Because the genome of the FX174 virus is a single-stranded form of DNA, it defies conventional wisdom. Since base-pairing is not an issue with single-stranded DNA, the nucleotide composition is more flexible.
