The base pairing concept of DNA structure served as the foundation for Erwin Chargaff's discoveries. Adenine and thymine are coupled with cytosine, whereas guanine and cytosine are associated with guanine in DNA. Due to this base pairing, it can be shown that in double-stranded DNA, the mole percents of G and C are equal, as well as the mole percents of A and T. The structure on which Chargaff's laws are based is the connection between the nucleotides. Not all DNA samples, meanwhile, abide with Chargaff's guidelines. For instance, the mole percents of A, C, G, and T are not identical in the single-stranded DNA of the virus FX174, where A=24, C=22, G=23, and T=31 This is so that alterations in the nucleotide composition are possible as single-stranded DNA does not have the base-pairing restrictions that double-stranded DNA does. Furthermore, Chargaff's guidelines were developed using DNA measurements from a variety of creatures, and DNA base composition may differ both across and within species.
