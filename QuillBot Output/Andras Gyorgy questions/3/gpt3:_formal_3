Erwin Chargaff made the significant finding that the mole percent of G in double-stranded DNA is equal to the mole percent of C, and that the mole percents of A and T are also identical. This is because of the DNA's particular base-pairing regulations, which pair A with T and C with G. This rule is not universal and does not apply to all DNA samples, such as single-stranded DNA such as the genome of the virus FX174, where the mole percents are A=24, C=22, G=23, and T=31. As single-stranded DNA lacks the base-pairing limitations of double-stranded DNA, it allows for nucleotide composition diversity. Furthermore, the base makeup of DNA may vary across species and sometimes within a species.
