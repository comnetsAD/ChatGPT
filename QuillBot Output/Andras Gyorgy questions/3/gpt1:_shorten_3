The base pairing principle of DNA structure explains Erwin Chargaff's finding that the mole percent of G is equal to the mole percent of C in DNA samples from a broad variety of species and that A and T are equivalent. Adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G) are the four nucleotides of DNA, and they always pair with T and G. Thus, DNA must include a G for every C and a T for every A. Chargaff's regulations depend on this nucleotide connection. Some DNA samples defy Chargaff's guidelines. A=24, C=22, G=23, and T=31 in the virus FX174's single-stranded DNA. Single-stranded DNA has fewer base-pairing limitations than double-stranded DNA, enabling nucleotide composition changes. Single-stranded DNA virus FX174 breaks the norms. Single-stranded DNA has a wider nucleotide makeup since base-pairing is not a factor.
