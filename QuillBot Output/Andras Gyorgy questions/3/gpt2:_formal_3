Erwin Chargaff's discoveries were based on the DNA structural concept of base pairing. In DNA, the pairing of the four nucleotides (adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine) is specific: A with T, and C with G. This base pairing leads to the finding that the percentage of G and C in double-stranded DNA are equal, as are the percentages of A and T. The structural foundation for Chargaff's laws is this interaction between the nucleotides. Nevertheless, not all DNA samples comply with Chargaff's standards. For instance, the mole percents of A, C, G, and T in the single-stranded DNA of the virus FX174 are not equal: A=24, C=22, G=23, and T=31. This is because single-stranded DNA lacks the base-pairing limitations of double-stranded DNA, allowing for nucleotide composition changes. In addition, Chargaff's guidelines were derived from measurements of DNA from a broad variety of creatures, and the base makeup of DNA may change across and within species.
