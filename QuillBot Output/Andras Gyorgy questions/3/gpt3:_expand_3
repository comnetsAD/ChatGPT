Erwin Chargaff made the significant finding that the mole percent of G in double-stranded DNA is equivalent to the mole percent of C, and that the mole percents of A and T are also equivalent to one another. This is because of the precise rules that govern base-pairing in DNA, which state that A must pair with T and C must pair with G. This rule does not, however, apply to all DNA samples. For instance, single-stranded DNA, such as the genome of the virus FX174, has the mole percents A=24, C=22, G=23, and T=31. This rule is not universal and it does not apply to all DNA samples. Because single-stranded DNA is not subject to the same base-pairing limitations as double-stranded DNA is, the nucleotide makeup of single-stranded DNA is more amenable to alteration. In addition, the sequence of the bases that make up DNA may change across different species as well as between individuals of the same species.
