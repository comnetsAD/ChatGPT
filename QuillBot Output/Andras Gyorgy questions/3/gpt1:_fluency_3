The base pairing concept of DNA structure underpins Erwin Chargaff's finding that the mole percent of G is equal to the mole percent of C in DNA samples from a broad variety of species, and the mole percents of A and T are identical. Adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G) are the four nucleotides of DNA, and they always couple up in the same way: A with T, and C with G. As a result, there must be a G for every C in the DNA, and a T for every A. The structural foundation for Chargaff's laws is the interaction between the nucleotides. However, not all DNA samples adhere to Chargaff's guidelines. The mole percents of the virus FX174's single-stranded DNA are not equal, with A=24, C=22, G=23, and T=31. This is due to the fact that single-stranded DNA lacks the base-pairing limitations that double-stranded DNA possesses, allowing for variances in nucleotide composition. Because the virus FX174's genome is single-stranded DNA, it does not follow the rules. Because single-stranded DNA is not bound by base-pairing, the nucleotide composition may vary more widely.
