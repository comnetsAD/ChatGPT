Erwin Chargaff discovered that in double-stranded DNA, G is equivalent to C, A, and T. DNA base-pairing regulations pair A with T and C with G. This criterion doesn't apply to single-stranded DNA like the virus FX174's genome, which has mole percents of A=24, C=22, G=23, and T=31. Single-stranded DNA permits nucleotide composition alterations due to its base-pairing freedom. DNA base makeup may vary across and among species.
