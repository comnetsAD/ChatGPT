The observation made by Erwin Chargaff, according to which the mole percent of G is equal to the mole percent of C in DNA samples taken from a wide range of organisms, and the mole percents of A and T are equal, can be explained by the fact that the base pairing principle underlies the structure of DNA. Adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G) are the four nucleotides that make up DNA, and they always pair up in a precise manner. More specifically, A always pairs up with T, and C always pairs up with G. Since this is the case, there must be a G in the DNA for each and every C, and there must be a T for each and every A. Chargaff's guidelines have their conceptual foundation in the structural connection that exists between the nucleotides. Nevertheless, not all DNA samples behave according to Chargaff's criteria. The mole percents of the four different bases, A=24, C=22, G=23, and T=31, do not add up to 100 in the case of the single-stranded DNA of the virus FX174. This is due to the fact that single-stranded DNA does not have the same limits on base-pairing that double-stranded DNA does, which allows for more nucleotide diversity. The genome of the FX174 virus is a single-stranded DNA, which means that it does not follow the laws. Because the formation of base pairs in single-stranded DNA is not a requirement, the nucleotide composition may be more freely varied.
