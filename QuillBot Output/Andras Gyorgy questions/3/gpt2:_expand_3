The findings made by Erwin Chargaff were founded on the base-pairing concept that underlies the structure of DNA. The four nucleotides that make up DNA—adenine, thymine, cytosine, and guanine—are coupled with one another in a certain way: adenine is paired with thymine, while cytosine is associated with guanine. As a result of these base pairings, it was discovered that the mole percent of G in double-stranded DNA is equivalent to the mole percent of C, and that the mole percents of A and T are also equivalent to one another. Chargaff's guidelines have their conceptual foundation in the structural connection that exists between the nucleotides. Nevertheless, not all DNA samples behave according to Chargaff's criteria. For instance, in the case of the single-stranded DNA of the virus FX174, the mole percents of A, C, G, and T are not identical. The value of A is 24, the value of C is 22, the value of G is 23, and the value of T is 31. This is due to the fact that single-stranded DNA does not have the same limits on base-pairing that double-stranded DNA does, which allows for more nucleotide diversity. In addition, Chargaff's guidelines were derived through measurements of DNA extracted from a diverse assortment of creatures. The fundamental constituents of DNA are known to vary not just across species but also between individuals of the same species.
