Erwin Chargaff found that in double-stranded DNA, the mole percentages of G and C are identical, and those of A and T are also equal. This is because A pairs with T and C pairs with G according to DNA's strict base-pairing regulations. Single-stranded DNA, such as the genome of the virus FX174, has mole percents of A=24, C=22, G=23, and T=31, hence this criterion does not hold true for all DNA samples. Variations in nucleotide composition are permitted in single-stranded DNA because it lacks the base-pairing limitations of double-stranded DNA. DNA base makeup may also vary across species and even between individuals of the same species.
