The finding of Erwin Chargaff that the mole percent of G is equal to the mole percent of C in DNA samples from a variety of animals, and that the mole percents of A and T are also identical, is based on the base pairing principle of DNA structure. The four nucleotides in DNA are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G), and they always couple up in a certain way: A with T and C with G. Therefore, every C in the DNA must be paired with a G, and every A with a T. The structural foundation for Chargaff's laws is this interaction between the nucleotides. Nevertheless, not all DNA samples comply with Chargaff's standards. In the instance of the virus FX174's single-stranded DNA, the mole percentages of A=24, C=22, G=23, and T=31 are not identical. This is because single-stranded DNA lacks the base-pairing limitations of double-stranded DNA, allowing for nucleotide composition changes. The genome of the virus FX174 has a single-stranded DNA, hence it does not follow the rules. The nucleotide makeup of single-stranded DNA is not bound by base-pairing, hence it may vary more widely.
