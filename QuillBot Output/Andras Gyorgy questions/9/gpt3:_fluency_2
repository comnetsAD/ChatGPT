The enzyme RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA. It reads the DNA code and then synthesizes a corresponding RNA molecule using one of the DNA strands as a template. RNA polymerase attaches to a specific section of DNA known as a promoter, which acts as the transcriptional start point. Following that, the RNA polymerase proceeds along the DNA, reading the genetic information and adding nucleotides to the developing RNA strand. This procedure is repeated until the RNA polymerase reaches a particular sequence known as the termination signal, at which time transcription is terminated and the RNA molecule is released.
