RNA polymerase converts DNA into RNA. It synthesizes a corresponding RNA molecule from the DNA instructions. RNA polymerase starts transcription by binding to a DNA promoter. RNA polymerase reads the genetic code and adds nucleotides to the RNA strand as it proceeds along the DNA. The RNA molecule is released when the RNA polymerase reaches the termination signal.
