An enzyme called RNA polymerase is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of DNA into RNA. It deciphers the DNA code and builds a corresponding RNA molecule using one of the DNA strands as a template. The promoter, which is the starting point for transcription, is a particular area on the DNA that RNA polymerase attaches to. After decoding the genetic code and adding nucleotides to the expanding RNA strand, the RNA polymerase proceeds along the DNA. Transcription doesn't stop and the RNA molecule is released when the RNA polymerase reaches a particular sequence known as the termination signal.
