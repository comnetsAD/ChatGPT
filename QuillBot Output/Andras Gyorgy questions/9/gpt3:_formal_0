RNA polymerase is an enzyme that catalyzes DNA to RNA transcription. It reads the DNA code and creates a complementary RNA molecule using one of the DNA strands as a template. RNA polymerase binds to a promoter on the DNA, which serves as the initiation site for transcription. The RNA polymerase reads the genetic code and adds nucleotides to the growing RNA strand as it moves along the DNA. This process continues until the RNA polymerase reaches a particular sequence known as the termination signal, at which point transcription is terminated and the RNA molecule is released.
