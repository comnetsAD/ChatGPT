RNA polymerase converts DNA into RNA. It synthesizes a complementary RNA molecule from the DNA code. RNA polymerase starts transcription by binding to a DNA promoter. RNA polymerase reads the genetic code and adds nucleotides to the RNA strand as it moves along the DNA. The RNA molecule is released when the RNA polymerase reaches the termination signal.
