RNA polymerase is an enzyme that catalyzes DNA to RNA transcription. It reads the DNA code and creates a corresponding RNA molecule using one of the DNA strands as a template. RNA polymerase interacts to a promoter on the DNA, which serves as the initiation site for transcription. The RNA polymerase reads the genetic code and adds nucleotides to the developing RNA strand as it advances along the DNA. This process continues until the RNA polymerase reaches a certain sequence known as the termination signal, at which time transcription is terminated and the RNA molecule is released.
