The enzyme RNA polymerase catalyzes the transcription of DNA into RNA. It reads the DNA code and then synthesizes a complementary RNA molecule using one of the DNA strands as a template. RNA polymerase binds to a specific region of DNA known as a promoter, which serves as the transcriptional start point. Following that, the RNA polymerase moves along the DNA, reading the genetic code and adding nucleotides to the growing RNA strand. This process is repeated until the RNA polymerase reaches a specific sequence known as the termination signal, at which point transcription is terminated and the RNA molecule is released.
