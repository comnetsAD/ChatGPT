Transcription from DNA to RNA is catalyzed by the enzyme RNA polymerase. The DNA code is deciphered, and a corresponding RNA molecule is synthesized using a strand of DNA as a template. Transcription begins when RNA polymerase attaches to a promoter, a particular piece of DNA. The RNA polymerase then continues its journey along the DNA, stopping to read the genetic code and add new nucleotides to the expanding RNA strand as it goes. When the RNA polymerase enzyme reaches a certain sequence known as the termination signal, transcription stops and the RNA molecule is released.
