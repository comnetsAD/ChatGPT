RNA polymerase is an enzyme that is responsible for catalyzing the process of DNA being converted into RNA. It does so by reading the DNA code and then creating a complementary RNA molecule by employing one of the DNA strands as a template for the process. RNA polymerase forms a complex with a particular section of the DNA known as a promoter, which acts as the origination point for the process of transcription. After then, the RNA polymerase proceeds along the DNA, reading the genetic code as it goes, and adding nucleotides to the strand of RNA that is forming. This process will continue until the RNA polymerase reaches a particular sequence known as the termination signal. Once the RNA polymerase reaches this sequence, transcription will come to an end, and the RNA molecule will be released.
