An individual's immediate social and relational milieu may influence their educational results, according to research. Family income, parental education and employment, and community features may influence a child's educational attainment and academic success. Low-income students are more likely to attend schools with less resources, less experienced instructors, and less demanding curriculum, which might affect their academic performance. Low-income students may also have less enrichment options outside of school, such as extracurricular programs or summer camps, which may further widen the success gap. Parental education and career may affect a child's schooling. Research shows that children whose parents have greater education and higher-paying occupations are more likely to attend better-performing schools and have more resources, which may improve academic achievements. Living in a poor area might also impair a child's education. Research shows that children living in neighborhoods with high levels of poverty and crime are more likely to attend lower-performing schools, have less access to resources like libraries and community centers, and experience more stress and trauma, which can affect their academic performance and mental health. Research reveals that an individual's immediate social and relational milieu might significantly affect their educational results.
