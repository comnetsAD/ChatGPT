The individual's immediate social and relational environment can have a significant impact on their educational outcomes. Studies have demonstrated that factors such as family structure, poverty, and community resources can significantly influence the educational experiences and outcomes of an individual. Research has shown, for instance, that children from single-parent households are more likely to have lower educational achievement and graduation rates than children from two-parent households. Additionally, poverty can negatively affect educational outcomes. Children from low-income families are more likely to attend schools with fewer resources and less-experienced teachers, which can result in poorer academic performance. In addition, the level of education and income of a person's parents can influence their educational outcomes. Children of parents with higher levels of education and income are more likely to have positive educational experiences and outcomes, in part because they have greater access to educational resources and opportunities. Children residing in areas with a high crime rate and limited access to community resources, such as libraries and parks, may have fewer educational opportunities and face greater educational obstacles. The immediate social and relational context in which a person grows up can have a substantial effect on their educational outcomes.
