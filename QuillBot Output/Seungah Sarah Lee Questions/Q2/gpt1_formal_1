According to research, a person's immediate social and relational milieu can have a substantial effect on their educational outcomes. The opportunities and resources available to a kid are influenced by factors such as family income, parental education and occupation, and neighborhood features, which can have an effect on their educational attainment and academic performance. Studies have shown, for instance, that children from low-income households are more likely to attend schools with fewer resources, less experienced teachers, and less rigorous curricula, which can have a negative impact on their academic attainment. In addition, children from low-income households may have fewer options for enrichment activities outside of school, such as extracurricular programs or summer camps, which might exacerbate the achievement gap between them and their wealthier friends. Additionally, parental education and career can influence a child's educational outcomes. Children whose parents have greater levels of education and higher-paying occupations are more likely to attend better-performing schools and have access to more resources, which can contribute to better academic achievements, according to research. Additionally, living in a deprived community can impact a child's academic performance. Children living in neighborhoods with high levels of poverty and crime are more likely to attend low-performing schools, have less access to resources such as libraries and community centers, and experience more stress and trauma, which can have a negative effect on their academic performance and mental health, according to research. Overall, research indicates that an individual's immediate social and relational environment can have a considerable impact on their educational outcomes. Opportunities and resources available to a kid can be influenced by factors such as family income, parental education and occupation, and community features, which can affect academic attainment and accomplishment.
