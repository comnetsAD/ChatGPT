An individual's immediate social and relational context may influence their educational outcomes, according to research. Family income, parental education and occupation, and neighborhood characteristics can influence a child's educational attainment and academic success. Low-income children are more likely to attend schools with fewer resources, less experienced teachers, and less challenging curricula, which can hurt their academic performance. Low-income children may also have fewer enrichment opportunities outside of school, such as extracurricular programs or summer camps, which can further widen the achievement gap. Parental education and occupation can affect a child's education. Research shows that children whose parents have higher education and higher-paying jobs are more likely to attend better-performing schools and have more resources, which can improve academic outcomes. Living in a poor neighborhood can also affect a child's education. Research shows that children living in neighborhoods with high levels of poverty and crime are more likely to attend lower-performing schools, have less access to resources like libraries and community centers, and experience more stress and trauma, which can affect their academic performance and mental health. Research suggests that an individual's immediate social and relational context can significantly affect their educational outcomes. Family income, parental education and occupation, and neighborhood characteristics can impact a child's academic success.
