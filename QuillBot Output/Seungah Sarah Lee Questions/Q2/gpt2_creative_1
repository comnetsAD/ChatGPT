It has been shown that a person's educational outcomes are strongly influenced by their immediate social and relational milieu throughout their formative years. Numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of contextual elements in determining a student's educational experiences and outcomes. For instance, studies have indicated that children of single parents have lower rates of academic success and graduation than their two-parent counterparts. This may be the result of several circumstances, including a lack of emotional and financial support from a second parent and a lack of role models who have completed higher levels of schooling. The effects of poverty on learning are often overlooked. Low-income students have a higher propensity to attend schools with fewer resources and less experienced teachers, both of which can have a negative impact on student performance. They may also be deprived of resources crucial to a quality education, such as computers, clubs, and books. An individual's educational outcomes may also be affected by their parents' level of education and money. Children of higher-income and higher-educated families tend to have better school experiences and outcomes. A person's educational accomplishments may also be affected by their upbringing and the society in which they live. There may be less educational possibilities and greater difficulties for kids who grow up in high-crime neighborhoods with restricted access to community amenities like libraries and parks. Overall, a person's educational outcomes may be affected significantly by the social, relational milieu in which they grow up. An individual's educational prospects and experiences are influenced by their family and socioeconomic backgrounds as well as the resources available to them in their local community.
