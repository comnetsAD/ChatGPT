A child's immediate social and relational environment can affect their educational success. Family structure, poverty, and community resources have been demonstrated to affect educational attainment. For instance, single-parent children had poorer school success and graduation rates than two-parent children. Lack of emotional and financial support from a second parent and a lack of role models with higher education may contribute to this. Poverty also hurts schooling. Low-income children attend schools with fewer resources and less experienced teachers, which can impair academic achievement. They may also lack technology, extracurricular activities, and educational tools needed for a decent education. Educational achievements can also depend on parents' education and income. Due to increased resources and opportunity, children of higher-educated and higher-income parents have better educational experiences and outcomes. Educational achievements can also depend on a person's area and community. Children in high-crime regions with restricted access to community facilities like libraries and parks may have fewer learning chances and more educational obstacles. Overall, a child's initial social, relational milieu can affect their educational outcomes. Family structure, poverty, and community resources might affect a student's schooling and academic success.
