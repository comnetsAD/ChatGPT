An individual's immediate social and relational milieu in which they grow up can have a substantial impact on their educational outcomes. According to research, factors such as family structure, poverty, and community resources can all have a substantial impact on an individual's educational experiences and outcomes. Children from single-parent households, for example, have poorer school success and graduation rates than children from two-parent households, according to study. This can be due to a variety of causes, including a lack of emotional and financial support from a second parent, as well as a lack of role models with higher levels of education. Poverty can also have a negative impact on academic performance. Low-income children are more likely to attend schools with fewer resources and less experienced teachers, which can contribute to lower academic attainment. They may also lack access to technology, extracurricular activities, and educational resources, all of which are necessary for a good education. Additionally, an individual's parents' level of education and income can influence their educational success. Children with higher levels of education and income are more likely to have positive educational experiences and results, owing to greater access to resources and opportunities. The culture and neighborhood in which a person grows up might also influence their educational success. Children who grow up in high-crime regions with limited access to community facilities like libraries and parks may have less opportunities to study and face more obstacles in school. Overall, an individual's immediate social, relational milieu in which they grow up can have a substantial impact on their educational outcomes. Family structure, poverty, and community resources can all influence an individual's educational experiences and opportunities, and hence their academic achievement.
