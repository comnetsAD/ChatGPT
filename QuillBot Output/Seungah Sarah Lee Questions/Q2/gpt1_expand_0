According to the findings of some studies, the immediate social and relational context of an individual can have a significant effect on the educational outcomes of that individual. The opportunities and resources that are available to a child can be shaped by a variety of factors, including their family's income, their parents' education and occupation, and the characteristics of their neighborhood, all of which can, in turn, affect the educational attainment and academic achievement of the child. Studies have shown, for instance, that children who come from families with low incomes are more likely to attend schools that have fewer resources, teachers with less experience, and curricula that are less challenging, all of which can have a negative impact on the children's academic achievement. Children who come from families with low incomes may also have fewer opportunities for enrichment activities outside of school, such as summer camps or extracurricular programs, which can further widen the achievement gap between them and their peers who come from families with higher incomes. A child's educational outcomes can also be influenced by their parents' levels of education as well as the careers they choose. Research has shown that children whose parents have higher levels of education and higher-paying jobs are more likely to attend better-performing schools and have more resources available to them, both of which can lead to better academic outcomes for the children.

According to the findings of some studies, children who grow up in communities that have high rates of both poverty and crime are more likely to go to schools with lower test scores, have less access to resources like libraries and community centers, and experience more stress and trauma. All of these factors can have a negative effect on the academic success and mental health of these children. Research in its entirety suggests that the immediate social and relational context in which an individual grows up can have a significant impact on the educational outcomes that the individual experiences as a result of their education. A child's access to opportunities and resources, which in turn can have an impact on their academic attainment and achievement, can be influenced by a variety of factors, including their family's income, their parents' education and occupation, as well as the characteristics of their neighborhood.
