An individual's immediate social and relational context in which they grow up can have a significant impact on their educational outcomes. According to research, family income, parental education levels, and family structure can all have an impact on a child's educational attainment. Students from low-income families, for example, are more likely to face educational disadvantages such as attending under-resourced schools, a lack of access to educational materials and technology, and fewer opportunities for extracurricular activities. Students from low-income families may experience lower academic achievement and graduation rates as a result of these factors. Parental education levels influence a child's educational outcomes. Children of more educated parents are more likely to have access to educational resources and support, which can lead to improved educational outcomes. Another important factor that can influence educational outcomes is family structure. According to research, students from single-parent families are more likely to face educational disadvantages such as lower academic achievement and graduation rates. In addition to these variables, social capital, or the networks and resources to which individuals have access, can influence educational outcomes. Students who have more social capital, such as access to educational resources and networks, are more likely to succeed academically. To summarize, an individual's immediate social and relational context in which they grow up can have a significant impact on their educational outcomes. Family income, parental education levels, family structure, and social capital can all influence a child's educational experiences and outcomes.
