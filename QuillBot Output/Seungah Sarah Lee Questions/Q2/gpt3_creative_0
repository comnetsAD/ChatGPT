An individual's educational outcomes may be significantly influenced by the social and relational environment in which they were raised. Recent studies have found that a child's educational outcomes can be affected by a variety of contextual factors, including family income, parental education levels, and family structure. Students from low-income families, for instance, are more likely to experience educational disadvantages, such as attending under-resourced schools, lacking access to educational materials and technology, and having fewer opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities. Students from low-income backgrounds are particularly vulnerable to these factors, which can have a negative impact on their school performance and their likelihood of graduating. A child's educational outcomes are affected by their parents' educational backgrounds. Children of parents with advanced degrees have a better chance of getting the help and resources they need to succeed in school. A student's academic success may also be affected by their family dynamic. Studies have shown that children of single parents have it harder to succeed in school and are less likely to graduate. The networks and resources that people have access to are examples of social capital, and they can play a role in a person's educational outcomes alongside the aforementioned factors. Socially advantaged students, those who have better access to educational resources and networks, are more likely to succeed academically. In conclusion, a person's social and relational surroundings during their formative years have a powerful bearing on their later academic success. A child's educational experiences and outcomes can be influenced by factors such as family income, parental education level, family structure, and social capital.
