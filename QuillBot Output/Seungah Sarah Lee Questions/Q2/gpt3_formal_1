The individual's immediate social and relational environment can have a substantial impact on their educational outcomes. According to research, factors such as family income, parental education, and family structure might impact a child's educational success. Students from low-income households, for instance, are more likely to encounter educational disadvantages, such as attending under-resourced schools, lacking access to instructional resources and technology, and having fewer extracurricular options. These variables can contribute to low academic success and graduation rates among low-income students. The amount of parental education also influences the educational outcomes of a child. Children of educated parents are more likely to have access to educational resources and assistance, which can lead to improved educational outcomes. Another key aspect that can influence educational success is family structure. Students from single-parent families are more likely to encounter scholastic disadvantages, such as poorer academic success and graduation rates, according to research. Social capital, or the networks and resources to which an individual has access, can also influence educational achievements. Students with greater social capital, such as access to educational resources and networks, are more likely to achieve superior academic results. In conclusion, an individual's immediate social and relational environment can have a substantial impact on their educational outcomes. The educational experiences and outcomes of a kid can be influenced by factors such as family income, parental education levels, family structure, and social capital.
