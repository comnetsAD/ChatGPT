An individual's immediate social and relational milieu in which they grow up may have a substantial influence on their educational results. According to research, family income, parental education levels, and family structure may all have an impact on a child's educational success. Students from low-income households, for example, are more likely to experience educational disadvantages such as attending under-resourced schools, a lack of access to instructional resources and technology, and less possibilities for extracurricular activities. Students from low-income homes may have reduced academic attainment and graduation rates as a result of these issues. Parental education levels influence a child's educational results. Children with more educated parents are more likely to have access to educational resources and assistance, which may lead to improved educational results. Another key aspect that might impact educational success is family structure. According to research, kids from single-parent families are more likely to face educational disadvantages such as poorer academic success and graduation rates. In addition to these variables, social capital, or the networks and resources to which people have access, may influence educational achievements. Students who have greater social capital, such as access to educational resources and networks, are more likely to succeed academically. To summarize, an individual's immediate social and relational milieu in which they grow up may have a substantial influence on their educational results. Family income, parental education levels, family structure, and social capital may all influence a child's educational experiences and results.
