According to the findings of several studies, the immediate social and relational setting of an individual can have a considerable effect on the educational results of that individual. The opportunities and resources that are available to a child can be shaped by a variety of factors, including their family's income, their parents' education and occupation, and the characteristics of their neighborhood, all of which can, in turn, affect the educational attainment and academic achievement of the child. Studies have shown, for instance, that children who originate from families with poor incomes are more likely to attend schools that have fewer resources, instructors with less experience, and curriculum that are less difficult, all of which can have a detrimental influence on the children's academic success. Children who originate from homes with low incomes may also have less options for enrichment activities outside of school, such as summer camps or extracurricular programs, which can further increase the achievement gap between them and their classmates who come from households with higher incomes. A child's educational results can also be influenced by their parents' levels of education as well as the careers they choose. Research has shown that children whose parents have higher levels of education and higher-paying jobs are more likely to attend better-performing schools and have more resources available to them, both of which can lead to better academic outcomes for the children.

According to the findings of some studies, children who grow up in communities that have high rates of both poverty and crime are more likely to go to schools with lower test scores, have less access to resources like libraries and community centers, and experience more stress and trauma. All of these factors can have a negative effect on the academic success and mental health of these children. Research in its whole reveals that the immediate social and relational setting in which an individual grows up can have a major influence on the educational results that the individual experiences as a result of their schooling. A child's access to opportunities and resources, which in turn can have an impact on their academic attainment and accomplishment, can be influenced by a variety of factors, including their family's income, their parents' education and career, as well as the qualities of their neighborhood.
