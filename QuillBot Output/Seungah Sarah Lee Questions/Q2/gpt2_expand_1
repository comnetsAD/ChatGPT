The immediate social and relational environment in which a person grows up can have a substantial impact on the educational outcomes that person experiences as a result of that environment. Studies have demonstrated that factors like as family composition, economic status, and the availability of community resources can all play a big part in determining the educational experiences and outcomes that an individual has. For instance, studies have shown that the educational attainment and graduation rates of children who were raised in families with only one parent are much lower than those of children who were raised in households with both parents present. This may be due to a number of factors, including a lack of emotional and financial support from a second parent, as well as a lack of role models who have completed higher levels of education. Another possible cause is that there are not enough people who have completed higher levels of education to serve as examples. The results of educational endeavors might also be negatively influenced by poverty. Children who originate from households with lower incomes are more likely to attend schools that have fewer resources and teachers with less experience, both of which can contribute to lower levels of academic accomplishment. In addition, they could not have access to the fundamental components of a quality education, such as educational materials, extracurricular activities, and technological resources. In addition, an individual's educational outcomes can also be affected by their parents' degree of education as well as their financial level. Children whose parents have greater incomes and education levels are more likely to have better educational experiences and outcomes. This is due, in part, to the fact that these children have more access to resources and opportunities. It is possible that a person's educational outcomes will be influenced by the town and neighborhood in which they spent their formative years. Children who live in areas with high crime rates and limited access to community resources, such as libraries and parks, may have fewer opportunities to learn and may experience more difficulties in their educational pursuits. This is because children who live in these types of areas may be more likely to be victims of crime. The immediate social and relational milieu in which an individual grows up can have a major impact on the individual's educational outcomes. This is true on a global scale. An individual's educational experiences and opportunities can be shaped by factors such as family composition, economic status, and the resources available in their community, which can eventually have an effect on the individual's level of academic success.
