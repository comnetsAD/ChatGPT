According to research, a person's immediate social and relational setting can have a substantial influence on their educational results. Family income, parental education and employment, and community features may all determine the possibilities and resources available to a kid, affecting their educational attainment and academic success. Children from low-income households, for example, are more likely to attend schools with fewer resources, less experienced instructors, and less demanding curriculum, which might have a detrimental influence on their academic progress. Furthermore, children from low-income households may have less options for enrichment activities outside of school, such as extracurricular programs or summer camps, widening the achievement gap between them and their more affluent friends. Parental education and career can also influence a child's educational performance. Children with greater levels of education and higher-paying occupations are more likely to attend better-performing schools and have more resources accessible to them, which can contribute to better academic achievements, according to research. Furthermore, living in a low-income area might have an impact on a child's educational performance. Children living in high-poverty, high-crime neighborhoods are more likely to attend lower-performing schools, have less access to resources such as libraries and community centers, and experience more stress and trauma, which can negatively impact their academic achievement and mental health, according to research. Overall, research indicates that an individual's immediate social and relational milieu in which they grow up can have a major influence on their educational success. Family income, parental education and career, and community factors can determine a child's possibilities and resources, which can effect their academic attainment and accomplishment.
