According to research, a person's immediate social and relational situation may significantly affect how well they do in school. The opportunities and resources available to a kid may be shaped by a variety of factors, including family income, parental education and employment, and community features, which in turn can have an impact on the child's academic success and educational attainment. Children from low-income households are more likely to attend schools with less resources, less qualified instructors, and less demanding curriculum, for instance, which may have a detrimental effect on their academic performance. More so than their more wealthy friends, kids from low-income homes can also have less possibilities for extracurricular activities or summer camps, which might expand the achievement gap between them and them. The educational results of a kid may also be influenced by the education and employment of the parents. According to research, kids with more educated and well-paid parents are more likely to attend schools that perform better and have access to more resources, which may improve their academic achievements. Furthermore, a child's academic results may suffer if they reside in an underprivileged area. According to research, children who reside in areas with high rates of poverty and crime are more likely to attend schools with lower test scores, have less access to resources like libraries and community centers, and encounter more stress and trauma, all of which can have a detrimental effect on their academic performance and mental well-being. Overall, the evidence points to a considerable connection between an individual's educational results and the immediate social and relational milieu in which they are raised. The possibilities and resources available to a kid may be shaped by factors including family income, parental education and employment, and community features, which can impact their academic progress and accomplishment.
