An individual's immediate social and relational milieu may influence their educational outcomes, according to research. Family income, parental education and occupation, and community features can influence a child's educational attainment and academic success. Low-income students are more likely to attend schools with fewer resources, less experienced teachers, and less demanding curricula, which can affect their academic performance. Low-income students may also have less enrichment opportunities outside of school, such as extracurricular programs or summer camps, which can further widen the success gap. Parental education and career can affect a child's schooling. Research shows that children whose parents have greater education and higher-paying occupations are more likely to attend better-performing schools and have more resources, which can improve academic achievements. Living in a poor neighborhood might also impair a child's education. Research shows that children living in neighborhoods with high levels of poverty and crime are more likely to attend lower-performing schools, have less access to resources like libraries and community centers, and experience more stress and trauma, which can affect their academic performance and mental health.
