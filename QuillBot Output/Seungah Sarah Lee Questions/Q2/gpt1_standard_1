According to research, a person's immediate social and relational situation can significantly affect how well they do in school. The opportunities and resources available to a kid can be shaped by a variety of factors, including family income, parental education and occupation, and community features, which in turn can have an impact on the child's academic achievement and educational attainment. Children from low-income families are more likely to attend schools with fewer resources, less qualified teachers, and less demanding curricula, for instance, which may have a negative effect on their academic performance. More so than their more affluent friends, kids from low-income homes can also have fewer possibilities for extracurricular activities or summer camps, which might expand the achievement gap between them and them. The educational outcomes of a child can also be influenced by the education and occupation of the parents. According to research, kids with more educated and well-paid parents are more likely to attend schools that perform better and have access to more resources, which can improve their academic achievements. Furthermore, a child's academic results may suffer if they reside in an underprivileged area. According to research, children who reside in areas with high rates of poverty and crime are more likely to attend schools with lower test scores, have less access to resources like libraries and community centers, and encounter more stress and trauma, all of which can have a detrimental effect on their academic performance and mental well-being. Overall, the evidence points to a considerable connection between an individual's educational outcomes and the immediate social and relational milieu in which they are raised. The possibilities and resources available to a kid can be shaped by factors including family income, parental education and occupation, and community features, which can impact their academic progress and accomplishment.
