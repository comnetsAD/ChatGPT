A child's immediate social and relational environment can affect their educational outcomes. Family structure, poverty, and community resources have been shown to affect educational outcomes. For instance, single-parent children have lower educational achievement and graduation rates than two-parent children. Lack of emotional and financial support from a second parent and a lack of role models with higher education may contribute to this. Poverty also hurts education. Low-income children attend schools with fewer resources and less experienced teachers, which can lower academic achievement. They may also lack technology, extracurricular activities, and educational materials needed for a good education. Educational outcomes can also depend on parents' education and income. Due to more resources and opportunities, children of higher-educated and higher-income parents have better educational experiences and outcomes. Educational outcomes can also depend on a person's neighborhood and community. Children in high-crime areas with limited access to community resources like libraries and parks may have fewer learning opportunities and more educational challenges. Overall, a child's immediate social, relational context can affect their educational outcomes. Family structure, poverty, and community resources can affect a student's education and academic success.
