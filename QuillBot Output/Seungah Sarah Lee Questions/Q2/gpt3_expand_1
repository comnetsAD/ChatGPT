The immediate social and relational environment in which a person grows up can have a substantial impact on the educational outcomes that person experiences as a result of that environment. According to research, a child's educational achievement can be affected by a variety of factors, including family finances, the educational levels of the child's parents, and the structure of the family. Students who come from families with lower incomes, for instance, are more likely to face educational challenges. These challenges can include attending schools with fewer resources, not having access to educational materials and technology, and having fewer opportunities to participate in extracurricular activities. Students who originate from homes with poor incomes are more likely to have worse academic achievement and a lower graduation rate as a result of these variables. The educational attainment of a child is also impacted by the educational backgrounds of the child's parents. Children whose parents have completed higher levels of education have a greater chance of gaining access to educational resources and support, both of which have the potential to improve the children's academic performance. Another significant aspect that can have an effect on educational results is the composition of the family. According to the findings of several studies, children who grow up in households with only one parent are more likely to have scholastic challenges, including lower rates of academic accomplishment and graduation. In addition to the characteristics listed above, social capital, which refers to the networks and resources to which an individual has access, can also play a part in the outcomes of educational endeavors. Students who have access to a wider variety of educational materials and networks, for example, are more likely to succeed academically than those who do not have these advantages. In a nutshell, the immediate social and relational setting in which a person grows up can have a substantial impact on the educational outcomes that person experiences later in life. A child's educational experiences and outcomes can be influenced by a variety of factors, including but not limited to the degree of parental education, the financial level of the family, the composition of the family, and the amount of social capital in the community.
