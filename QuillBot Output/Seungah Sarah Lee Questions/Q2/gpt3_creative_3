An individual's educational results may be significantly influenced by the social and relational environment in which they were raised. Recent studies have shown that a child's educational outcomes may be affected by a variety of contextual variables, including family income, parental education levels, and family structure. Students from low-income households, for instance, are more likely to experience educational disadvantages, such as attending under-resourced schools, missing access to instructional resources and technology, and having less chances to participate in extracurricular activities. Students from low-income backgrounds are more vulnerable to these issues, which may have a negative impact on their school performance and their likelihood of graduating. A child's educational results are affected by their parents' educational backgrounds. Children with parents with advanced degrees have a greater chance of getting the help and resources they need to succeed in school. A student's academic success may also be affected by their family dynamic. Studies have shown that children of single parents have it harder to succeed in school and are less likely to graduate. The networks and resources that people have access to are examples of social capital, and they may play a role in a person's educational success alongside the aforementioned elements. Socially advantaged students, those who have greater access to educational resources and networks, are more likely to succeed academically. In conclusion, a person's social and relational surroundings throughout their formative years have a powerful bearing on their later academic success. A child's educational experiences and results may be influenced by factors such as family income, parental education level, family structure, and social capital.
