It has been shown that a person's educational outcomes are strongly influenced by their immediate social and relational context during their formative years. Numerous studies have demonstrated the importance of contextual factors in determining a student's educational experiences and outcomes. For instance, studies have shown that children of single parents have lower rates of academic success and graduation than their two-parent counterparts. This may be the result of several factors, including a lack of emotional and financial support from a second parent and a lack of role models who have completed higher levels of education. The effects of poverty on learning are often overlooked. Low-income students have a higher propensity to attend schools with fewer resources and less experienced teachers, both of which can have a negative impact on student performance. An individual's educational outcomes may also be affected by their parents' level of education and income. Children of higher-income and higher-educated families tend to have better educational experiences and outcomes. A person's educational outcomes may also be affected by their upbringing and the community in which they live. There may be fewer educational opportunities and more difficulties for kids who grow up in high-crime neighborhoods with limited access to community resources like libraries and parks. Overall, a person's educational outcomes may be affected significantly by the social, relational context in which they grow up. An individual's educational opportunities and experiences are influenced by their family and socioeconomic backgrounds as well as the resources available to them in their local community.
