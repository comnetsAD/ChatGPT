According to studies, a person's immediate social and relational milieu can have a major effect on their academic performance. A child's educational attainment and academic success may be influenced by their family's socioeconomic status, the level of education and employment of their parents, and the nature of their local community. Studies have shown, for instance, that low-income students tend to attend schools with fewer resources, less experienced teachers, and less demanding curricula, all of which can have a negative effect on students' academic performance. The achievement gap between children from low-income households and their more affluent counterparts can be exacerbated by the fact that children from low-income homes may have less options for enrichment activities outside of school, such as extracurricular programs or summer camps. A child's educational outcomes may also be influenced by their parents' level of education and by the jobs that their parents have. Children of parents with higher educational attainment and incomes have a greater chance of being enrolled in high-performing schools and having access to additional resources, which can improve their academic performance. A child's educational outcomes can be negatively impacted by their living situation, which can be exacerbated by being located in a low-income neighborhood. Children in low-income and high-crime areas tend to attend schools with lower test scores, have less access to community resources like libraries, and may be more vulnerable to the negative psychological effects of stress and trauma. Overall, studies have shown that one's early social and relational environment has a major bearing on their later academic success. Opportunities and resources available to a kid can be influenced by factors such as family income, parental education and occupation, and neighborhood features, all of which have an impact on the child's academic proficiency and success.
