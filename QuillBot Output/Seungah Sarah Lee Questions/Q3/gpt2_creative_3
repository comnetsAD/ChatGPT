The dispute over whether or not current educational reform is successful is reflected in the tension between these two realities. One might say that people understand the need of educational reform for the sake of the future of society and the children who will populate it. The achievement gap, insufficient resources, and outmoded teaching techniques are all highlighted as problems that the school system must alter and improve to fix. However, other people believe that educational reform is unlikely because of all the obstacles it would provide. Unintended effects of reform initiatives are highlighted, as are the challenges of negotiating the political, bureaucratic, and economic frameworks that govern education systems. Education, educational institutions, and instructional procedures are all influenced by cultural assumptions. For instance, if people believe educational reform is important, they may prioritize accountability and evaluation, create laws and initiatives to close the achievement gap, and so on. A more cautious approach to change, with an emphasis on gradual improvements and pilot initiatives rather than large-scale reform attempts, may result from the widespread belief that educational reform is unlikely to succeed. Overall, these two realities interact with one another to shape education, education systems, and education processes by emphasizing the need for change and development while simultaneously admitting the problems and complexity involved in enacting reform. This continuing discussion has the potential to shape the creation of progressive but workable educational policies and initiatives.
