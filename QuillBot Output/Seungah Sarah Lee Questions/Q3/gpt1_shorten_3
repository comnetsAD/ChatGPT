Educational reform is complicated by these two realities. On one side, the school system needs urgent reform to enhance children's life prospects and society's future. However, executing such change is complex and may not always provide the expected results. The first perspective, that educational reform is necessary, stems from a desire to solve disparities and flaws in the present education system, such as the achievement gap across racial and ethnic groups and the absence of quality education for some populations. A well-functioning education system is vital for a healthy and affluent society, which drives it. The second impression, that educational reform is unlikely, underlines the challenges that might preclude effective change. This might include opposition from entrenched interests, lack of political will, and a lack of awareness of the core causes of the issues that need to be addressed. It shows the complexity of education systems and the necessity to understand how different variables affect educational attainment. These two views influence educational change. Understanding the challenges and complexity may help plan and execute changes, while recognizing the need for change can encourage improvement. Reforms might fail or create damage if the core issues are not understood. In conclusion, these two realities show the complexity and urgency of education reform and the necessity to understand the system and its workings to achieve effective change. This demands a comprehensive strategy that considers education system complexity, core causes, and the political and social context of changes.
