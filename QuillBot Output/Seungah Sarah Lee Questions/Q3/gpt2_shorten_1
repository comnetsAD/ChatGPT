These two realities reflect the argument about educational reform's efficacy. Educational reform is needed to better children's lives and society's future. To address challenges like the achievement gap, poor resources, and obsolete teaching methods, this perspective promotes education system reform. However, due to the difficulties of change, educational reform is seen as unlikely. This approach emphasizes the challenges of navigating political, bureaucratic, and economic processes that govern education systems and the possibility for unexpected consequences of reform. Perceptions influence education, systems, and processes. Educational reform can lead to accountability, assessment, and policies and initiatives to address specific concerns like the achievement gap. However, if educational reform is seen as unlikely, incremental improvements and experimental projects may be prioritized over large-scale reform. These two realities shape education, systems, and processes by emphasizing the need for change and development while acknowledging the difficulties of reform. This debate can inform ambitious but practical education policies and activities.
