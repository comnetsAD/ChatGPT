A varied and complex picture of educational change emerges from these two perspectives. A majority of people agree that the education system has to undergo significant reform and development in order to properly prepare today's youth for successful participation in society in the future. However, it is recognized that enacting such a shift can be challenging and may not always produce the desired results. The first view, that education reform is necessary, is motivated by the need to close gaps in opportunity and outcomes in schools, such as the achievement gap between racial and ethnic groupings and the dearth of quality education for some communities. This is motivated in part by the realization that a thriving educational system is crucial to the success of any society as a whole. The complexity and difficulty of bringing about real change in schools is reflected in the second view, that educational reform is unlikely to succeed. Many factors, such as opposition from entrenched interests, a lack of political will, and an inability to identify and grasp the true sources of the problems, contribute to this impasse. This highlights the need of analyzing the relationships between the many elements that influence students' academic performance. Because of the mutual influence of these two perspectives, our approach to educational reform is shaped by a combination of both. Knowing there is a problem and working to fix it is a good start, but being aware of the challenges and intricacies will help you craft a solution that works. However, changes may be inefficient or even counterproductive if they are enacted without first identifying and addressing the underlying causes of the problems. In sum, these contrasting views of the world underline the importance of doing research into the education system before making any drastic changes. Considering the multifaceted nature of educational institutions, the persistence of underlying issues, and the political and social climate in which reforms are being implemented are all necessary components of a comprehensive strategy.
