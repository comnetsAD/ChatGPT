These two perspectives on reality interact with one another in that they serve as a reflection of the ongoing discussion regarding the efficacy of educational reform. On the one hand, it is acknowledged that educational reform is required to increase children's chances for success in life and secure society's future. This viewpoint emphasizes the necessity of reforming the educational system to address problems including the achievement gap, a lack of funding, and obsolete teaching strategies. On the other hand, some people believe that educational reform is unlikely because of the difficulties and difficulties associated with enacting change. These perspectives have a variety of effects on education, educational systems, and educational procedures. A focus on accountability and assessment, as well as the creation of policies and programs geared at solving particular problems like the achievement gap, might result from the belief that educational reform is required. Overall, these two perspectives on reality interact to shape education, educational systems, and educational practices by emphasizing the need for development and change while simultaneously understanding the difficulties and complexity associated with putting reform into practice. This continual discussion can help create educational policies and initiatives that are both comprehensive and realistic.
