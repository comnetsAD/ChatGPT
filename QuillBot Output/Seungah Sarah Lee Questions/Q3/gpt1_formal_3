These two realities give an intricate and nuanced understanding of educational change. On the one hand, the urgent need for reform and development in the education system is acknowledged in order to provide students with better life opportunities and safeguard the future of society. On the other hand, it is recognized that executing such change may be challenging and may not always provide the intended results. The first perspective, that educational reform is necessary, is motivated by the desire to solve disparities and deficiencies in the present education system, such as the achievement gap between racial and ethnic groups and the lack of access to quality education for certain populations. In addition, it is motivated by the realization that a well-functioning education system is crucial for a healthy and thriving society. The second perspective, that educational reform is implausible, underlines the complexity and constraints that might impede substantive progress. This might include opposition from entrenched interests, a lack of political will, and a failure to comprehend the underlying causes of the issues that must be addressed. It also reflects the complexity of education systems and the necessity to comprehend the interaction of several variables that influence educational results. These two views influence our approach to educational change via their interaction. Understanding the constraints and difficulties may guide the design and execution of reforms, while recognizing the need for change can inspire efforts to enhance the system. However, the implementation of changes may be inefficient or even destructive without a comprehensive knowledge of the underlying causes of issues. In conclusion, these two perspectives of reality illustrate the complexity and urgency of education reform, as well as the necessity to comprehend the system and its inner workings in order to enact substantive change. This demands a comprehensive approach that takes into consideration the complexity of education systems, the underlying causes of issues, and the political and social context of changes.
