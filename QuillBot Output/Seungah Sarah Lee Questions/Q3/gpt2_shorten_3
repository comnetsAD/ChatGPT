These two realities represent the argument about educational reform's efficacy. Educational reform is needed to better children's lives and society's future. To address challenges like the achievement gap, poor resources, and obsolete teaching techniques, this approach promotes education system reform. However, owing to the difficulties of change, educational reform is seen as unlikely. This approach emphasizes the challenges of negotiating political, bureaucratic, and economic processes that govern education systems and the possibility for unexpected effects of change. Perceptions influence education, institutions, and processes. Educational reform may lead to accountability, evaluation, and policies and initiatives to address particular concerns like the achievement gap. However, if educational reform is seen as unlikely, incremental improvements and experimental projects may be prioritized over large-scale reform. These two realities shape education, institutions, and processes by emphasizing the need for change and development while admitting the difficulties of reform. This discussion may inform ambitious but realistic education policies and activities.
