The debate over whether or not current educational reform is effective is reflected in the tension between these two realities. One can say that people understand the importance of educational reform for the sake of the future of society and the children who will populate it. The achievement gap, insufficient resources, and outmoded teaching methods are all highlighted as problems that the education system must change and improve to fix. However, some people believe that educational reform is unlikely because of all the obstacles it would present. Unintended consequences of reform efforts are highlighted, as are the challenges of navigating the political, bureaucratic, and economic structures that shape education systems. Education, educational systems, and instructional procedures are all influenced by cultural assumptions. For instance, if people believe educational reform is important, they may prioritize accountability and assessment, create policies and programs to close the achievement gap, and so on. A more cautious approach to change, with an emphasis on incremental improvements and pilot programs rather than large-scale reform efforts, may result from the widespread belief that educational reform is unlikely to succeed. Overall, these two realities interact with one another to shape education, education systems, and education processes by emphasizing the need for change and improvement while also acknowledging the challenges and complexities involved in implementing reform. This ongoing discussion has the potential to shape the creation of progressive yet workable educational policies and initiatives.
