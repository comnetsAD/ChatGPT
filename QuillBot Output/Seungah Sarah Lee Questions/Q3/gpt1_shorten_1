Educational reform is complicated by these two realities. On one side, the school system needs urgent reform to improve children's life chances and society's future. However, executing such change is complex and may not always yield the expected results. The first perception, that educational reform is necessary, stems from a desire to solve disparities and shortcomings in the current education system, such as the achievement gap across racial and ethnic groups and the absence of quality education for some populations. A well-functioning education system is vital for a healthy and affluent society, which drives it. The second perception, that educational reform is unlikely, underlines the challenges that can preclude effective change. This can include resistance from entrenched interests, lack of political will, and a lack of awareness of the core causes of the problems that need to be addressed. It shows the complexity of education systems and the necessity to understand how different factors affect educational attainment. These two views influence educational reform. Understanding the challenges and complexities can help plan and implement changes, while recognizing the need for change can encourage improvement. Reforms might fail or cause harm if the core issues are not understood. In conclusion, these two realities show the complexity and urgency of education reform and the necessity to understand the system and its workings to make effective change. This demands a holistic strategy that considers education system complexity, core causes, and the political and social context of reforms.
