These two realities give an intricate and nuanced understanding of educational reform. On the one hand, the urgent need for change and development in the education system is acknowledged in order to provide students with better life opportunities and safeguard the future of society. On the other hand, it is recognized that executing such change can be challenging and may not always produce the desired results. The first perception, that educational reform is necessary, is motivated by the desire to solve disparities and deficiencies in the current education system, such as the achievement gap between racial and ethnic groups and the lack of access to quality education for certain populations. In addition, it is motivated by the realization that a well-functioning education system is crucial for a healthy and thriving society. The second perspective, that educational reform is improbable, underlines the complexities and constraints that can impede substantive progress. This can include opposition from entrenched interests, a lack of political will, and a failure to comprehend the underlying causes of the problems that must be addressed. It also reflects the complexity of education systems and the necessity to comprehend the interplay of multiple factors that influence educational outcomes. These two perceptions influence our approach to educational change through their interaction. Understanding the constraints and difficulties can guide the design and implementation of reforms, while recognizing the need for change can inspire efforts to enhance the system. However, the implementation of reforms can be inefficient or even destructive without a comprehensive knowledge of the underlying causes of problems. In conclusion, these two perspectives of reality illustrate the complexity and urgency of education reform, as well as the necessity to comprehend the system and its inner workings in order to enact substantive change. This demands a comprehensive approach that takes into account the complexity of education systems, the underlying causes of issues, and the political and social context of reforms.
