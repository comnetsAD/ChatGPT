These two realities present an intricate and nuanced view of educational reform. On the one hand, the urgent need for change and improvement in the education system is acknowledged in order to provide children with better life opportunities and safeguard the future of society. On the other hand, it is recognized that implementing such change can be challenging and may not always produce the desired results. The first perception, that educational reform is necessary, is motivated by the desire to address inequalities and deficiencies in the current education system, such as the achievement gap between racial and ethnic groups and the lack of access to quality education for certain populations. In addition, it is motivated by the recognition that a well-functioning education system is crucial for a healthy and prosperous society. The second perception, that educational reform is improbable, highlights the complexities and obstacles that can impede substantive change. This can include opposition from entrenched interests, a lack of political will, and a failure to comprehend the underlying causes of the problems that must be addressed. It also reflects the complexity of education systems and the need to comprehend the interplay of multiple factors that influence educational outcomes. These two perceptions influence our approach to educational reform through their interaction. Understanding the obstacles and complexities can inform the design and implementation of reforms, while recognizing the need for change can motivate efforts to enhance the system. However, the implementation of reforms can be ineffective or even harmful without a clear understanding of the underlying causes of problems. In conclusion, these two perceptions of reality highlight the complexity and urgency of education reform, as well as the need to comprehend the system and its inner workings in order to enact substantive change. This requires a holistic approach that takes into account the complexity of education systems, the underlying causes of problems, and the political and social context of reforms.
