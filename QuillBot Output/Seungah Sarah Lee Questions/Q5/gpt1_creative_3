To a functionalist, education is a crucial institution that helps society as a whole by generating educated and productive workers, strengthening social bonds, and perpetuating economic and social stratification. To guarantee that everyone can play their part in society and contribute to its overall functioning, it is essential to provide everyone with educational opportunities, even in a nation or community that may not necessarily value education. According to conflict theorists, classroom instruction serves as a mechanism for perpetuating existing inequalities in wealth and status. Even if education is not highly regarded in a given nation or culture, those who are able to take advantage of educational possibilities may find themselves in a position of power and luxury. Therefore, for people who may prefer to forego formal education in favor of non-formal alternatives, it is essential to investigate how formal education is being used to sustain inequity and to strive towards the development of more equitable substitutes. Institutionalists see schooling as a social and cultural activity that is influenced by the priorities of the ruling class. Knowing how the education system is affected by the interests and values of people in power and how it may be reinforcing uneven power relations is essential in a nation or society where education may not be valued. Therefore, it is vital to investigate the cultural and social practices that construct the current education system and strive towards developing more democratic and inclusive alternatives for people who may choose to forego formal schooling in favor of non-formal options. The institutionalist stance appeals to me more than any other. Understanding the ways in which the interests and values of people in power impact education is crucial since education is shaped by cultural and social practices of the society. In a place or culture where schooling is not highly valued, it is all the more crucial to analyze how the educational system perpetuates inequitable power structures and to work toward developing more democratic and inclusive alternatives that better serve the community's values and interests.
