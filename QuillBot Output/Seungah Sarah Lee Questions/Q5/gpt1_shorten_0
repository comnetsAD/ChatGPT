Functionalists view education as an essential institution that promotes social cohesion, reproduces social and economic inequality, and educates a literate and skilled workforce. Therefore, even in a country or community that may not value education, it is important to ensure that all individuals have access to educational opportunities to fulfill their roles in society and contribute to community functioning. According to conflict theorists, education perpetuates social and economic inequality. Education can give people power and privilege in a country or community that doesn't value it. Therefore, those who may want to opt out of the modern education system in favor of non-formal alternatives should examine how the education system is used to maintain inequality and work toward more equitable alternatives. Institutionalists view education as a power-shaped cultural and social practice. In a country or community where education may not be valued, it is important to understand how the education system is shaped by power interests and values and may reproduce unequal power relations. Thus, those who want to leave the modern education system for non-formal alternatives should examine the cultural and social practices that shape it and work toward more democratic and inclusive alternatives. I prefer institutionalism. It is important to understand how power and culture shape education. In a country or community that doesn't value education, it's important to understand how the education system reproduces unequal power relations and work toward more democratic and inclusive alternatives that meet the community's values and needs.
