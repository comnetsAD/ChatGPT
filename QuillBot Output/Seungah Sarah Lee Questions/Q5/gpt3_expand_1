This is something that they would push for. Those who subscribe to the conflict theory would contend that education is vitally essential in any nation or society because of its capacity to perpetuate social and economic disparities. They would argue that powerful interest groups, like as the government and businesses, control the education system, and that the system is designed to benefit these interests at the expense of disadvantaged and oppressed groups. They would argue that education is utilized as a tool to preserve the existing power structures in society, and that it is vital to question these structures in order to promote social change and equality. This is because education is used as a tool to perpetuate the status quo.

Personally, I would say that education is important in a country or community from the standpoint of the conflict theory because it serves as a means to challenge and ultimately change the existing power structures that perpetuate social and economic inequality. This is why I would say that education is important in a country or community. Education is a potent instrument that can be utilized to advance social change and to empower communities that have historically been disenfranchised or oppressed. It is crucial to note that the current education system is frequently controlled by influential interest groups and that it can perpetuate these inequities even while it is important to acknowledge that non-formal alternatives may be helpful. Because of this, it is vital to conduct an in-depth analysis of the educational system as well as the power dynamics that exist within it in order to advance the cause of genuine equality and social justice.
