Education philosophers and theorists would certainly have differing explanations and reasons for the significance of education in a country or culture that does not necessarily value it or prefers non-formal alternatives to the current education system. Functionalists would argue that education is needed for society and the economy to operate. They would argue that education is a crucial component of socialization, preparing individuals for their responsibilities in society and fostering social stability. Additionally, they would argue that education is vital for economic growth and development since it equips individuals with the skills and information required to engage in the workforce. Education, according to conflict theorists, is a technique of social control employed to retain the authority of dominant groups and perpetuate social inequalities. They would claim that the education system is geared to promote those in authority while keeping underprivileged groups in their place. They would also argue that non-formal alternatives are frequently not alternatives since they are frequently underfunded and underresourced, hence perpetuating inequality. Institutionalists would argue that the education system is a crucial social institution that shapes individuals and society. In addition, they would claim that education is essential for the development of critical thinking, civic participation, and social cohesiveness. They would also argue that non-formal education options may have their own limits, such as a lack of certification, less access to resources and assistance, and may not be as successful in equipping persons with the skills and information they need to engage fully in society. Considering the aforementioned viewpoints, one might argue that education is crucial for the functioning of society and the economy and for economic growth and development since it equips individuals with the skills and knowledge necessary to engage in the labor force. Nonetheless, it is essential to recognize that the education system may perpetuate social injustice and that non-formal alternatives must be promoted and made available. Therefore, efforts should be made to make the education system more inclusive, egalitarian, and adaptable to the varying requirements of many populations.
