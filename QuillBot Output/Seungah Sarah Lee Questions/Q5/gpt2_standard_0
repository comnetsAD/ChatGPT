Different explanations and arguments for the value of education in a nation or community that may not necessarily value it or want to opt-out of the modern education system in favor of non-formal alternatives would likely be offered by philosophers and education theorists. Education, according to functionalists, is crucial to the health of society and the economy. Education, they contend, is a critical component of socialization, preparing people for their roles in society and fostering social stability. They would also contend that since education equips people with the knowledge and abilities required for employment, it is crucial for economic growth and development. Conflict theorists contend that education is a social control tool that perpetuates social inequality and the power of dominant groups. They would contend that the educational system is set up to help the powerful and keep the weak in their place. Additionally, they contend that non-formal alternatives frequently lack the resources and funding necessary to be true alternatives, perpetuating inequality in the process. Institutionalists contend that the educational system is a social institution that has a significant impact on how people behave and how society develops. They would also contend that education is crucial for the growth of civic engagement, social cohesion, and critical thinking. They would also contend that non-formal education alternatives might have their own drawbacks, such as a lack of accreditation, restricted access to resources and support, and a potential inefficiency in supplying students with the abilities they need to participate fully in society. Although I don't personally have a preferred theoretical framework, it is possible to make the case that education is crucial for both the health of society and the economy as well as for economic growth and development because it equips people with the knowledge and skills required to participate in the labor force. It's also critical to recognize that the educational system can contribute to social inequality and that non-formal alternatives need to be encouraged and made available. In order to better serve the diverse needs of various communities, efforts should be made to make the educational system more inclusive, equitable, and responsive.
