Functionalists view education as an essential institution that promotes social cohesiveness, reproduces social and economic inequalities, and educates a literate and trained workforce. Therefore, even in a country or community that may not value education, it is necessary to guarantee that all persons have access to educational opportunities to fulfill their duties in society and contribute to communal functioning. According to conflict theorists, education perpetuates social and economic injustice. Education may give people power and privilege in a society or culture that doesn't appreciate it. Therefore, people who may desire to opt out of the current education system in favor of non-formal alternatives should study how the education system is employed to sustain inequality and strive toward more fair alternatives. Institutionalists view education as a power-shaped cultural and social activity. In a country or culture where education may not be valued, it is crucial to understand how the education system is formed by power interests and values and may reproduce uneven power relations. Thus, people who desire to leave the current education system for non-formal alternatives should evaluate the cultural and social practices that produce it and strive toward more democratic and inclusive alternatives. I prefer institutionalism. It is crucial to understand how power and culture impact education. In a country or community that doesn't value education, it's crucial to recognize how the education system reproduces uneven power relations and strive toward more democratic and inclusive alternatives that meet the community's values and needs.
