Education, according to functionalists, is an important institution that serves the requirements of society as a whole by producing literate and skilled labor, encouraging social cohesiveness, and replicating social and economic inequity. As a result, even in a country or community that may not value education, it is critical to ensure that all persons have access to educational opportunities in order to fulfill their roles in society and contribute to the overall functioning of the community. According to conflict theorists, education is a mechanism for perpetuating and reproducing social and economic inequality. Individuals with access to educational possibilities may be able to exploit that access to achieve power and privilege over others in a country or culture where education is not valued. As a result, for those who choose to avoid the current education system in favor of non-formal alternatives, it is critical to evaluate how the education system is utilized to sustain inequality and work toward building more egalitarian alternatives. Education, according to institutionalists, is a cultural and social activity formed by the interests and values of those in power. In a society or culture where education is not valued, it is critical to understand how the education system is formed by people in power's interests and values, and how it may reproduce uneven power relations. As a result, for individuals who choose to avoid the modern education system in favor of non-formal alternatives, it is critical to investigate the cultural and social practices that define the education system and work toward building more democratic and inclusive alternatives. Personally, I am inclined to the institutionalist viewpoint. Education is formed by societal cultural and social practices, and it is critical to understand how it is shaped by people in power's interests and ideals. In a country or community where education is not valued, it is critical to understand how the education system reproduces uneven power relations and to strive toward more democratic and inclusive alternatives that match with the community's values and needs.
