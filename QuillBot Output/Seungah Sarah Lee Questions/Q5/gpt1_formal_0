From a functionalist perspective, education is viewed as an institution that serves the needs of society as a whole by producing literate and skilled workers, fostering social cohesion, and reproducing social and economic inequality. Therefore, even in a country or community that may not necessarily value education, it is essential that all individuals have access to educational opportunities in order to fulfill their roles in society and contribute to the community's overall functioning. Education is viewed as a tool for maintaining and reproducing social and economic inequality, according to conflict theory. In a country or community where education may not be valued, those who have access to educational opportunities may be able to use those opportunities to gain power and privilege over others. For those who may want to opt out of the modern education system in favor of non-formal alternatives, it is crucial to examine how the education system is being used as a tool to maintain inequality and to create more equitable alternatives. Institutionalists view education as a cultural and social practice shaped by the values and interests of those in authority. In a country or community where education may not be highly valued, it is crucial to comprehend how the education system is shaped by the interests and values of those in power and how it may reproduce unequal power relations. For those who may want to opt out of the modern education system in favor of non-formal alternatives, it is crucial to examine the cultural and social practices that shape the education system and to create more democratic and inclusive alternatives.

Education is shaped by the cultural and social practices of society, and it is essential to comprehend how it is influenced by the interests and values of those in authority. In a country or community where education may not be valued, it is essential to comprehend how the education system reproduces unequal power relations and to create democratic and inclusive alternatives that reflect the community's values and needs.
