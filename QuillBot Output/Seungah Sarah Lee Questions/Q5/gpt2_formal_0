Education philosophers and theorists would likely have differing explanations and arguments for the significance of education in a country or community that does not necessarily value it or prefers non-formal alternatives to the modern education system. Functionalists would argue that education is essential for society and the economy to function. They would argue that education is a crucial component of socialization, preparing individuals for their roles in society and fostering social stability. Additionally, they would argue that education is necessary for economic growth and development because it equips individuals with the skills and knowledge required to participate in the workforce. Education, according to conflict theorists, is a tool of social control employed to maintain the power of dominant groups and perpetuate social inequality. They would argue that the education system is designed to benefit those in authority while keeping marginalized groups in their place. They would also argue that non-formal alternatives are frequently not alternatives because they are frequently underfunded and underresourced, thereby perpetuating inequality. Institutionalists would argue that the education system is a crucial social institution that shapes individuals and society. In addition, they would argue that education is essential for the development of critical thinking, civic participation, and social cohesion. They would also argue that non-formal education alternatives may have their own limitations, such as a lack of accreditation, less access to resources and support, and may not be as effective in equipping individuals with the skills and knowledge they need to participate fully in society. Considering the aforementioned perspectives, one could argue that education is essential for the functioning of society and the economy and for economic growth and development because it equips individuals with the skills and knowledge necessary to participate in the labor force. Nonetheless, it is essential to recognize that the education system can perpetuate social inequality and that non-formal alternatives must be supported and made available. Therefore, efforts should be made to make the education system more inclusive, equitable, and adaptable to the diverse needs of various communities.
