To a functionalist, education is a crucial institution that helps society as a whole by producing educated and productive workers, strengthening social bonds, and perpetuating economic and social stratification. To ensure that everyone can play their part in society and contribute to its overall functioning, it is essential to provide them with educational opportunities, even in a country or community that may not necessarily value education. According to conflict theorists, classroom instruction serves as a mechanism for perpetuating existing inequalities in wealth and status. Even if education is not highly valued in a given country or community, those who are able to take advantage of educational opportunities may find themselves in a position of power and privilege. Therefore, for those who may want to forego formal education in favor of non-formal alternatives, it is essential to investigate how formal education is being exploited to sustain inequity and to work towards the development of more equitable substitutes. Institutionalists view schooling as a social and cultural practice that is influenced by the priorities of the ruling class. Knowing how the education system is shaped by the interests and values of those in power and how it may be reproducing unequal power relations is essential in a country or community where education may not be valued. Therefore, it is important to investigate the cultural and social practices that shape the modern education system and work towards developing more democratic and inclusive alternatives for those who may wish to forego formal education in favor of non-formal options. The institutionalist stance appeals to me more than any other. Understanding the ways in which the interests and values of those in power shape education is crucial because education is shaped by cultural and social practices of the society. In a place or culture where schooling is not highly valued, it is all the more crucial to analyze how the educational system perpetuates inequitable power structures and to work toward developing more democratic and inclusive alternatives that better serve the community's values and needs.
