In a society or culture that does not necessarily value education, or that wants to forego the formal education system in favor of non-formal alternatives, educational philosophers and theorists may provide other explanations and reasons for the significance of education. Those who hold to the functionalist theory of value would say that education is crucial to the smooth operation of both the economy and society. They would say that school is crucial to socialization because it helps people find their place in society and keeps the peace. Education, they say, is crucial for economic growth and development because it equips people with the information and skills they need to enter the labor and contribute to the economy. It is the contention of conflict theorists that schools are instruments of social control that serve to reinforce existing power structures and perpetuate inequalities. They claim that schools are rigged to favor the wealthy and powerful while keeping minorities in their place. Non-formal alternatives, they would add, are frequently not true alternatives since they continue to replicate inequality due to a lack of funding and resources. The educational system, according to institutionalists, is a social institution that significantly influences both people and groups. A good education, they would say, is essential to the development of analytical skills, participation in public life, and communal harmony. There are many who believe that non-traditional forms of education aren't as successful in equipping students with the information and skills they need to properly engage in society, and they point to issues like a lack of certification, less resources, and less support as examples. While I don't subscribe to any particular theoretical framework, it seems reasonable to conclude from the discussion above that education is crucial to the health of our communities and economies and that it drives progress and innovation by equipping people with the knowledge and abilities they'll need to find gainful employment. Nonetheless, it is critical to recognize that formal education may perpetuate social injustice and that non-formal alternatives should also be encouraged and made available. There must be an increased focus on making the educational system accessible to people of all backgrounds and ensuring that it meets the requirements of all communities.
