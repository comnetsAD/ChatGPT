Education, according to functionalists, is an important institution that serves the needs of society as a whole by producing literate and skilled labor, promoting social cohesion, and reproducing social and economic inequality. As a result, even in a country or community that may not value education, it is critical to ensure that all individuals have access to educational opportunities in order to fulfill their roles in society and contribute to the overall functioning of the community. According to conflict theorists, education is a tool for maintaining and reproducing social and economic inequality. Individuals with access to educational opportunities may be able to use that access to gain power and privilege over others in a country or community where education is not valued. As a result, for those who wish to avoid the modern education system in favor of non-formal alternatives, it is critical to examine how the education system is used to maintain inequality and work toward creating more equitable alternatives. Education, according to institutionalists, is a cultural and social practice shaped by the interests and values of those in power. In a country or community where education is not valued, it is critical to understand how the education system is shaped by those in power's interests and values, and how it may reproduce unequal power relations. As a result, for those who wish to avoid the modern education system in favor of non-formal alternatives, it is critical to investigate the cultural and social practices that shape the education system and work toward creating more democratic and inclusive alternatives. Personally, I am drawn to the institutionalist viewpoint. Education is shaped by societal cultural and social practices, and it is critical to understand how it is shaped by those in power's interests and values. In a country or community where education is not valued, it is critical to understand how the education system reproduces unequal power relations and to work toward more democratic and inclusive alternatives that align with the community's values and needs.
