Different reasons and justifications for the worth of education in a nation or society that may not necessarily value it or choose to opt-out of the contemporary education system in favor of non-formal alternatives would likely be offered by philosophers and education theorists. Education, according to functionalists, is crucial to the health of society and the economy. Education, they contend, is a critical component of socialization, preparing people for their responsibilities in society and fostering social stability. They would also argue that because education equips people with the information and abilities required for employment, it is crucial for economic growth and development. Conflict theorists contend that education is a social control instrument that perpetuates social inequality and the authority of dominant groups. They would argue that the educational system is set up to help the powerful and keep the weak in their place. Additionally, they contend that non-formal alternatives sometimes lack the resources and funding necessary to be true alternatives, perpetuating inequality in the process. Institutionalists contend that the educational system is a social institution that has a significant impact on how people behave and how society develops. They would also argue that education is crucial for the growth of civic involvement, social cohesiveness, and critical thinking. They would also contend that non-formal education options can have their own drawbacks, such as a lack of certification, restricted access to resources and assistance, and a potential inefficiency in supplying students with the abilities they need to engage fully in society. Although I don't personally have a preferred theoretical framework, it is possible to make the case that education is crucial for both the health of society and the economy as well as for economic growth and development because it equips people with the knowledge and skills required to participate in the labor force. It's also critical to recognize that the educational system may contribute to social inequality and that non-formal alternatives ought to be encouraged and made available. In order to better serve the varying needs of many groups, efforts should be made to make the educational system more inclusive, egalitarian, and responsive.
