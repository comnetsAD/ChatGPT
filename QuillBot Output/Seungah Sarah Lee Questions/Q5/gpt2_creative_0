In a country or community that does not necessarily value education, or that wants to forego the formal education system in favor of non-formal alternatives, educational philosophers and theorists may offer different explanations and arguments for the significance of education. Those who hold to the functionalist theory of value would argue that education is crucial to the smooth operation of both the economy and society. They would say that school is crucial to socialization because it helps people find their place in society and keeps the peace. Education, they say, is crucial for economic growth and development because it equips people with the knowledge and skills they need to enter the workforce and contribute to the economy. It is the contention of conflict theorists that schools are instruments of social control that serve to reinforce existing power structures and perpetuate inequalities. They claim that schools are rigged to favor the wealthy and powerful while keeping minorities in their place. Non-formal alternatives, they would add, are often not true alternatives because they continue to reproduce inequality due to a lack of funding and resources. The educational system, according to institutionalists, is a social institution that significantly influences both individuals and groups. A good education, they would say, is essential to the growth of analytical skills, participation in public life, and communal harmony. There are those who believe that non-traditional forms of education aren't as effective in equipping students with the knowledge and skills they need to fully participate in society, and they point to issues like a lack of accreditation, fewer resources, and less support as examples. While I don't subscribe to any particular theoretical framework, it seems reasonable to conclude from the discussion above that education is crucial to the health of our communities and economies and that it drives progress and innovation by equipping people with the knowledge and abilities they'll need to find gainful employment. Nonetheless, it is critical to recognize that formal education can perpetuate social inequality and that non-formal alternatives should also be supported and made available. There must be an increased focus on making the educational system accessible to people of all backgrounds and ensuring that it meets the needs of all communities.
