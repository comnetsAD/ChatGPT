Functionalists believe education is important because it equips people with the knowledge, skills, and abilities they need to function in society. They would argue that education is necessary for social order and smooth functioning. Education also helps people improve their social and economic status, which benefits the community. Conflict theorists believe education perpetuates social and economic inequality. They claim that the government and businesses control the education system and use it to benefit themselves at the expense of marginalized and oppressed groups. They argue that education maintains social power structures and must be challenged to promote social change and equality. Institutionalists argue that education is important because it is ingrained in society and maintains social norms and values. They believe education is essential to socialization, teaching students a culture's values and norms. Education gives people the knowledge, skills, and abilities to function in society and reproduce social and economic structures, they say. I think education is important from a conflict theorist perspective because it challenges and changes power structures that perpetuate social and economic inequality. Education can empower marginalized groups and change society. Non-formal alternatives may be useful, but the modern education system is often controlled by powerful interest groups and can perpetuate these inequalities. To achieve true equality and social justice, the education system and its power dynamics must be critically examined.
