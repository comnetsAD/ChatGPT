Education is considered as an important institution from a functionalist point of view since it serves the requirements of society as a whole by generating literate and skilled workers, fostering social cohesion, and perpetuating social and economic inequalities. Therefore, even in a nation or community that does not necessarily place a high value on education, it is essential to make sure that all individuals have access to educational opportunities so that they can fulfill the roles that have been assigned to them in society and contribute to the smooth operation of the community as a whole. Education is viewed as a mechanism by conflict theorists as a means of perpetuating existing social and economic inequalities, as well as developing new ones. In a nation or culture that may not place a high value on education, those who have access to educational possibilities may be able to exploit that access to their advantage in order to achieve power and privilege over those around them. Therefore, for those who may be interested in pursuing non-formal educational alternatives rather than the contemporary education system, it is essential to investigate the ways in which the education system is being utilized as a tool for maintaining inequality and to work toward the development of educational alternatives that are more equitable. When viewed through the lens of institutional theory, education is understood to be a cultural and social activity that is molded by the priorities and ideals of those in positions of authority. In a nation or a community that may not place a high value on education, it is essential to have an understanding of how the education system is shaped by the interests and values of those in power and how it may be reproducing unequal power relations. This is because the education system is a major factor in the development of the education system. Examining the cultural and social practices that shape the education system and working toward the creation of alternatives that are more democratic and inclusive is important work to do for those who may want to opt out of the modern education system in favor of non-formal alternatives. This is why it is important for those who may want to opt-out of the modern education system in favor of non-formal alternatives. The institutionalist point of view is the one that most appeals to me personally. The cultural and social practices of a society have a significant impact on education, and it is essential to have a deep understanding of the ways in which education is influenced by the interests and values of those in positions of authority. In a nation or a community that may not place a high value on education, it is essential to gain an understanding of the ways in which the educational system reproduces unequal power relations and to work toward the development of alternative educational models that are more democratic and inclusive and that are in line with the priorities and requirements of the community.
