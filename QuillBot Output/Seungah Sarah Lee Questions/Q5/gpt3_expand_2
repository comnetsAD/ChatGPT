Those who subscribe to the conflict theory would contend that education is very essential in any nation or society because of its capacity to perpetuate social and economic disparities. They would claim that powerful interest groups, like as the government and companies, control the education system, and that the system is intended to benefit these interests at the expense of disadvantaged and oppressed groups. They would argue that education is utilized as a tool to preserve the current power structures in society, and that it is vital to question these structures in order to promote social change and equality. This is because education is used as a tool to perpetuate the status quo.

Personally, I would say that education is important in a country or community from the standpoint of the conflict theory because it serves as a means to challenge and ultimately change the existing power structures that perpetuate social and economic inequality. This is why I would say that education is important in a country or community. Education is a potent instrument that may be utilized to advance social change and to empower communities who have historically been disenfranchised or oppressed. It is crucial to note that the current education system is frequently dominated by influential interest groups and that it can perpetuate these inequities even while it is necessary to acknowledge that non-formal alternatives may be helpful. Because of this, it is vital to conduct an in-depth analysis of the educational system as well as the power dynamics that exist within it in order to advance the cause of genuine equality and social justice.
