From a functionalist viewpoint, education is seen as a significant institution that contributes to social cohesiveness, produces social and economic inequalities, and produces a workforce that is educated and skilled. Therefore, it is crucial to make sure that everyone has access to educational opportunities so they may perform their duties in society and contribute to the smooth operation of the community as a whole, even in a nation or community that may not necessarily value education. Education is seen from the standpoint of conflict theorists as a means of perpetuating social and economic inequality. People who have access to educational possibilities may be able to exploit that access to achieve power and privilege over others in a nation or society where education may not be valued. Therefore, it is crucial to consider how the educational system is being utilized as a vehicle for preserving inequality and to work toward providing more equitable options for people who may prefer to forego the current educational system in favor of non-formal alternatives. Education is seen from an institutionalist angle as a cultural and social activity that is influenced by the goals and principles of those in authority. Understanding how the education system is molded by the interests and values of people in power and how it may be reinforcing uneven power relations is crucial in a nation or community where education may not be valued. Therefore, it is crucial to look at the cultural and social practices that create the education system and work toward developing more democratic and inclusive options for people who may prefer to forego the contemporary educational system in favor of non-formal alternatives. Personally, I find the institutionalist viewpoint to be more compelling. It's critical to comprehend how the interests and values of people in authority impact education, which is molded by the cultural and social practices of the society. Understanding how the educational system reproduces uneven power relations is crucial if one want to create more democratic and inclusive alternatives that are in line with the interests and values of the community in a nation or community where education may not be highly valued.
