According to functionalists, education is an essential part of a nation or community because it provides a fundamental social function by equipping people with the information, skills, and talents required to operate in society. They would claim that education is crucial for the smooth running of society and the preservation of social order. They would also claim that education allows people to enhance their social and economic position, which helps the whole society. According to conflict theorists, education is crucial in a nation or society because it reproduces social and economic inequality. They would claim that the education system is dominated by strong interest groups such as the government and corporations, and that it is structured to benefit these interests at the cost of disadvantaged and oppressed groups. They would claim that education is utilized to perpetuate society's current power structures, and that challenging these systems is necessary to achieve social change and equality. Education, according to institutionalists, is crucial because it is a deeply rooted institution in society and is necessary for the preservation of societal norms and values. They would say that education is an important element of socialization because it teaches pupils the norms and values that are valued in a specific culture. They would also argue that education is a crucial element of social reproduction because it equips people with the information, skills, and capacities they need to operate in society and reproduce the current social and economic institutions. Personally, I believe that education is vital in a nation or community from a conflict theorist standpoint because it provides as a method to confront and eventually transform the current power structures that perpetuate social and economic inequalities. Education is a significant instrument for promoting social change and empowering underprivileged and oppressed communities. While non-formal options may be beneficial, it is critical to understand that the contemporary education system is often dominated by strong interest groups and has the potential to perpetuate inequality. In order to foster real equality and social justice, a critical analysis of the education system and its power dynamics is required.
