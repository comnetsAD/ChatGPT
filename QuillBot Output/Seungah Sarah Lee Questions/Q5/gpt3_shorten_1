Functionalists believe education is important because it equips people with the knowledge, skills, and abilities they need to function in society. They would claim that education is crucial for social order and smooth functioning. Education also helps people improve their social and economic status, which benefits the community. Conflict theorists believe schooling perpetuates social and economic inequality. They claim that the government and businessmen control the education system and use it to enrich themselves at the expense of marginalized and oppressed communities. They contend that education maintains social power systems and must be challenged to create social transformation and equality. Institutionalists think that education is crucial because it is ingrained in society and maintains social norms and values. They believe education is essential to socialization, teaching kids a culture's values and conventions. Education gives people the information, skills, and talents to participate in society and replicate social and economic institutions, they say. I think education is crucial from a conflict theorist standpoint because it challenges and changes power systems that perpetuate social and economic inequity. Education may empower underprivileged populations and transform society. Non-formal alternatives may be useful, however the current education system is typically dominated by powerful interest groups and can perpetuate existing inequities. To achieve true equality and social justice, the education system and its power dynamics must be critically examined.
