Functionalists contend that education is a crucial component of a nation or community because it helps people develop the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to contribute to society. They would contend that education is crucial for the preservation of social order and for the efficient operation of society. They would also contend that education gives people the chance to raise their social and economic standing, which ultimately helps the entire neighborhood. According to conflict theorists, education is crucial for a nation or community because it helps to maintain social and economic inequality. They would contend that the government and corporate interests, as well as other strong interest groups, are in charge of the educational system and that it is set up to benefit these groups at the expense of oppressed and marginalized ones. They would contend that because power structures in society are maintained through education, it is crucial to challenge these structures in order to advance social change and equality. The importance of education is argued by institutionalists to be due to the institution's pervasive social influence and the necessity of education in preserving social norms and values. They would contend that teaching students the norms and values that are valued in a particular culture is an important part of socialization. They would also contend that education plays a significant role in social reproduction by giving people the skills, knowledge, and abilities they need to contribute to society and perpetuate the social and economic structures that already exist. In my opinion, education is crucial for a nation or community from a conflict theorist standpoint because it provides a way to confront and, ultimately, transform the existing power structures that support social and economic inequality. Education is a potent tool that can be used to empower marginalized and oppressed groups and encourage social change. Although non-formal options might be beneficial, it's important to understand that the current educational system is frequently governed by strong interest groups and that it has the potential to maintain these disparities. Therefore, in order to advance real equality and social justice, a critical analysis of the educational system and the power dynamics within it is required.
