Functionalists contend that education is a crucial component of a nation or community because it helps people develop the information, skills, and capacities necessary to contribute to society. They would contend that education is crucial for the preservation of social order and for the efficient operation of society. They would also contend that education gives people the chance to raise their social and economic standing, which eventually helps the entire neighborhood. According to conflict theorists, education is crucial for a nation or society since it helps to maintain social and economic disparity. They would contend that the government and corporate interests, as well as other strong interest groups, are in charge of the educational system and that it is set up to benefit these groups at the expense of oppressed and disadvantaged ones. They would contend that because power structures in society are maintained through education, it is crucial to confront these systems in order to advance social change and equality. The importance of education is argued by institutionalists to be due to the institution's pervasive social influence and the necessity of education in preserving social norms and values. They would contend that teaching kids the norms and values that are valued in a specific culture is an important part of socialization. They would also contend that education plays a significant role in social reproduction by giving people the skills, information, and abilities they need to contribute to society and perpetuate the social and economic institutions that already exist. In my opinion, education is crucial for a nation or society from a conflict theorist standpoint because it provides a way to confront and, ultimately, transform the existing power structures that support social and economic injustice. Education is a potent instrument that can be utilized to empower underprivileged and oppressed populations and encourage social change. Although non-formal options could be beneficial, it's crucial to understand that the current educational system is frequently governed by strong interest groups and that it has the potential to maintain existing disparities. Therefore, in order to advance real equality and social justice, a critical analysis of the educational system and the power dynamics inside it is required.
