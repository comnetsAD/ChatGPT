Education philosophers and theorists would most likely have various explanations and justifications for the necessity of education in a country or society that may not value it or choose to opt out of the modern education system in favor of non-formal alternatives. According to functionalists, education is necessary for society and the economy to operate. They would say that education is an important aspect in socializing because it prepares people for roles in society and promotes social stability. They would also argue that education is vital for economic growth and development because it gives people with the skills and information they need to work. According to conflict theorists, education is a social control instrument used to sustain the authority of dominant groups and reproduce social inequalities. They would claim that the educational system is set up to promote those in power while keeping oppressed groups in check. They would also argue that non-formal alternatives are sometimes not actually alternatives because they are frequently underfunded and under-resourced, perpetuating inequity. Institutionalists would argue that the educational system is a social institution that shapes individuals and society. They would also argue that education is crucial for critical thinking, civic involvement, and social cohesiveness. They would also argue that non-formal education options may have their own limits, such as a lack of certification, less access to resources and assistance, and may be less successful in providing persons with the essential skills and knowledge to fully engage in society. Personally, I don't have a preferred theoretical framework, but given the various perspectives presented above, one could argue that education is critical for the functioning of society and the economy, as well as for economic growth and development, because it provides individuals with the skills and knowledge required to participate in the labor force. However, it is equally necessary to recognize that the education system has the potential to perpetuate social inequality and that non-formal alternatives should be promoted and made available. As a result, efforts should be undertaken to make the education system more inclusive, equal, and sensitive to the various needs of various populations.
