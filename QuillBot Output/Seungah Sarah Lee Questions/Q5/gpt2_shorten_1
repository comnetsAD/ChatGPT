Philosophers and theorists of education would certainly have different reasons and justifications for the necessity of education in a country or society that may not value it or choose to opt out of the modern education system for non-formal alternatives. Functionalists say society and the economy need education. Education prepares people for society and promotes social stability, they say. Education also gives people the skills and knowledge to work, which boosts the economy. Conflict theorists believe education is a weapon of social control used to preserve power and inequality. They say the school system favors the powerful and marginalizes others. They also claim that underfunded and under-resourced non-formal alternatives perpetuate inequality. Institutionalists believe education is a social institution that shapes people and society. Education promotes critical thinking, civic involvement, and social solidarity, they say. They also contend that non-formal education alternatives may lack accreditation, funding, and support, and may not provide the skills and information needed to fully engage in society. I don't have a theoretical framework, but based on the perspectives above, education is crucial for society and the economy since it gives people the skills and knowledge to work. However, the school system can perpetuate socioeconomic inequalities, thus non-formal alternatives should be promoted and made available. Thus, the education system should be more inclusive, equal, and responsive to varied groups.
