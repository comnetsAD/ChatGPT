From a functionalist perspective, education is viewed as a significant institution that contributes to social cohesion, produces social and economic inequality, and produces a workforce that is educated and skilled. Therefore, it is crucial to make sure that everyone has access to educational opportunities so they can fulfill their roles in society and contribute to the smooth operation of the community as a whole, even in a nation or community that may not necessarily value education. Education is viewed from the perspective of conflict theorists as a means of perpetuating social and economic inequality. People who have access to educational opportunities may be able to use that access to gain power and privilege over others in a nation or community where education may not be valued. Therefore, it is crucial to consider how the educational system is being used as a tool for maintaining inequality and to work toward creating more equitable alternatives for those who may want to forego the modern educational system in favor of non-formal alternatives. Education is viewed from an institutionalist angle as a cultural and social practice that is influenced by the goals and principles of those in authority. Understanding how the education system is shaped by the interests and values of those in power and how it may be reproducing unequal power relations is crucial in a nation or community where education may not be valued. Therefore, it is crucial to look at the cultural and social practices that shape the education system and work toward developing more democratic and inclusive alternatives for those who may want to forego the modern educational system in favor of non-formal alternatives. Personally, I find the institutionalist viewpoint to be more compelling. It's critical to comprehend how the interests and values of those in authority shape education, which is shaped by the cultural and social practices of the society. Understanding how the educational system reproduces unequal power relations is crucial if one wishes to create more democratic and inclusive alternatives that are in line with the needs and values of the community in a nation or community where education may not be highly valued.
