In a nation or community that does not necessarily value education or that wants to opt out of the modern education system in favor of non-formal alternatives, educational philosophers and theorists would most likely have different explanations and arguments for the significance of education. These explanations and arguments could be either positive or negative. Theorists who subscribe to the functionalist school of thought would contend that formal education is necessary to ensure the smooth operation of both the economy and society. They would contend that education is one of the most important aspects of socialization because it helps individuals get ready for their roles in society and fosters social stability. They would also argue that education is necessary for economic growth and development because it equips individuals with the skills and knowledge necessary to participate in the workforce. This is because education provides individuals with the skills and knowledge they need to participate in the workforce. Education, in the view of conflict theorists, functions as a tool of social control because it helps dominant groups to maintain their power and perpetuates existing patterns of social inequality. They would argue that the educational system is set up in such a way as to benefit those who are already in power and to keep marginalized groups where they belong. They would also argue that non-formal alternatives are not always true alternatives because they are frequently underfunded and under-resourced, which means that they continue to reproduce inequality. This is another argument that they would make. Institutionalists would argue that the educational system is a social institution that plays an important part in the formation of both individuals and society as a whole. They would also contend that education is necessary for the growth of critical thinking, civic engagement, and social cohesion in a society. They would also argue that non-formal education alternatives may have their own limitations, such as a lack of accreditation, less access to resources and support, and the possibility that they are not as effective in providing individuals with the necessary skills and knowledge for them to fully participate in society. Personally, I don't have a particular theoretical framework that I prefer, but taking into consideration the various viewpoints presented above, one could argue that education is necessary for the proper functioning of society and the economy, and that it is essential for economic growth and development because it equips individuals with the knowledge and skills that are required to participate in the workforce. This is because education provides individuals with the skills and knowledge that are required to participate in the workforce. However, it is essential to recognize that the education system can contribute to the maintenance of social inequality and that informal alternatives, in addition to formal ones, should be supported and made available. As a result, there is a need for increased effort to be put into making the educational system more inclusive, equitable, and sensitive to the various requirements of the various communities.
