Education philosophers and theorists would most likely have different explanations and arguments for the importance of education in a country or community that may not value it or wish to opt out of the modern education system in favor of non-formal alternatives. According to functionalists, education is necessary for society and the economy to function. They would argue that education is an important factor in socialization because it prepares people for roles in society and promotes social stability. They would also argue that education is necessary for economic growth and development because it provides people with the skills and knowledge they need to work. According to conflict theorists, education is a social control tool used to maintain the power of dominant groups and reproduce social inequality. They would argue that the educational system is set up to benefit those in power while keeping marginalized groups in check. They would also argue that non-formal alternatives are frequently not truly alternatives because they are frequently underfunded and under-resourced, perpetuating inequality. Institutionalists would argue that the educational system is a social institution that shapes individuals and society. They would also argue that education is important for critical thinking, civic engagement, and social cohesion. They would also argue that non-formal education alternatives may have their own limitations, such as a lack of accreditation, less access to resources and support, and may be less effective in providing individuals with the necessary skills and knowledge to fully participate in society. Personally, I don't have a preferred theoretical framework, but given the various perspectives presented above, one could argue that education is critical for the functioning of society and the economy, as well as for economic growth and development, because it provides individuals with the skills and knowledge required to participate in the labor force. However, it is also important to recognize that the education system has the potential to perpetuate social inequality and that non-formal alternatives should be supported and made available. As a result, efforts should be made to make the education system more inclusive, equitable, and responsive to the various needs of various communities.
