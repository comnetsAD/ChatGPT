Education, according to functionalists, is crucial to a nation or community because it equips its members with the information and skills they need to participate fully in society. They would say that education is crucial for society to operate normally and that it helps keep the peace. In addition, they would say that education helps people rise up the economic and social ladder, which is good for everyone. Education, according to conflict theorists, is crucial because it perpetuates social and economic inequalities within a society or community. They would say that the government and corporations have too much influence in schools, and that the system is rigged to favour the wealthy and the powerful at the cost of the poor and the powerless. That education is utilized to reinforce existing power structures is something they may bring up as an argument for why it's important to question such systems in the sake of fostering social change and equality. To institutionalists, education is crucial to the upkeep of societal norms and values, and hence is of paramount importance. Some would say that teaching pupils the values and standards that are prized in a society is one of the most important functions of schools. Education, they say, is crucial to maintaining social and economic order because it equips people with the information and skills they need to participate in and perpetuate society. From a conflict theorist's point of view, I believe that education is crucial for every society or group because it can be used to undermine the systems in place that maintain social and economic disparities. In order to bring about positive social change and provide voice to underrepresented populations, education is a crucial factor. The current education system is frequently dominated by strong interest groups and may perpetuate these disparities, therefore it's crucial to acknowledge the value of non-formal options as well. So, to advance genuine equality and social justice, it is essential to conduct a critical analysis of the educational system and the power dynamics inside it.
