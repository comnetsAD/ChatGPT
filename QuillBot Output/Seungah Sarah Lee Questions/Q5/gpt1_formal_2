From a functionalist perspective, education is viewed as an institution that serves the requirements of society as a whole by generating literate and competent workers, fostering social cohesiveness, and replicating social and economic inequity. Therefore, even in a country or community that may not necessarily value education, it is essential that all persons have access to educational opportunities in order to perform their duties in society and contribute to the group's overall functioning. Education is viewed as a mechanism for preserving and reproducing social and economic inequality, according to conflict theory. In a culture or society where education may not be respected, those who have access to educational possibilities may be able to utilize those opportunities to achieve power and privilege over others. For people who may desire to opt out of the current education system in favor of non-formal alternatives, it is crucial to investigate how the education system is being used as a tool to sustain inequality and to create more equitable alternatives. Institutionalists view education as a cultural and social activity affected by the beliefs and interests of those in authority. In a society or culture where education may not be highly valued, it is crucial to comprehend how the education system is formed by the interests and values of those in power and how it may reproduce uneven power relations. For people who may desire to opt out of the current education system in favor of non-formal alternatives, it is crucial to investigate the cultural and social practices that influence the education system and to create more democratic and inclusive alternatives. Personally, I'm more interested in the institutionalist viewpoint. Education is molded by the cultural and social practices of society, and it is essential to comprehend how it is influenced by the interests and ideals of those in authority. In a country or community where education may not be valued, it is essential to comprehend how the education system reproduces uneven power relations and to create democratic and inclusive alternatives that reflect the community's values and needs.
