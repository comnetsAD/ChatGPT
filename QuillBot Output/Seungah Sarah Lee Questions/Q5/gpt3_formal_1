Functionalists would argue that education is an essential component of a country or community because it equips individuals with the knowledge, skills, and talents necessary to function in society. They would claim that education is required for the efficient operation of society and for the maintenance of social order. In addition, they would argue that education affords individuals the chance to enhance their social and economic standing, which eventually benefits the entire community. Conflict theorists would argue that education is crucial in a country or society because it perpetuates social and economic inequality. They would claim that the education system is geared to serve powerful interest groups, such as the government and corporations, at the expense of disadvantaged and oppressed communities. They would claim that education is utilized to preserve the existing power structures in society, and that it is necessary to confront these systems to promote social change and equality. Institutionalists would argue that education is necessary for the maintenance of social norms and values since it is an institution that is deeply rooted in society. They would say that education is a significant facet of socialization because it teaches students the ideal norms and values of a given culture. They would also argue that education is a crucial component of social reproduction because it equips individuals with the knowledge, skills, and talents necessary to operate in society and to perpetuate the existing social and economic systems. In my opinion, education is vital in a country or community from a conflict theorist perspective because it provides a method to confront and ultimately alter the existing power structures that perpetuate social and economic injustice. Education is a potent instrument for fostering social transformation and empowering underprivileged and oppressed communities. Despite the potential value of non-formal alternatives, it is essential to remember that the current education system is frequently dominated by powerful interest groups and can perpetuate existing disparities. To promote true equality and social justice, a critical study of the education system and the power dynamics within it is important.
