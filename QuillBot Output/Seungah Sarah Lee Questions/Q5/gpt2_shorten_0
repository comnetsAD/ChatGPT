Philosophers and theorists of education would likely have different explanations and arguments for the importance of education in a country or community that may not value it or want to opt out of the modern education system for non-formal alternatives. Functionalists say society and the economy need education. Education prepares people for society and promotes social stability, they say. Education also gives people the skills and knowledge to work, which boosts the economy. Conflict theorists believe education is a tool of social control used to maintain power and inequality. They say the education system favors the powerful and marginalizes others. They also claim that underfunded and under-resourced non-formal alternatives perpetuate inequality. Institutionalists believe education is a social institution that shapes people and society. Education promotes critical thinking, civic engagement, and social cohesion, they say. They also argue that non-formal education alternatives may lack accreditation, resources, and support, and may not provide the skills and knowledge needed to fully participate in society. I don't have a theoretical framework, but based on the perspectives above, education is essential for society and the economy because it gives people the skills and knowledge to work. However, the education system can perpetuate social inequality, so non-formal alternatives should be supported and made available. Thus, the education system should be more inclusive, equitable, and responsive to diverse communities.
