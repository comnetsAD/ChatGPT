Many countries' current educational systems can trace their roots back to the industrial revolution and the resulting shifts in economic and social norms. Its original purpose was to equip people with the know-how they'd need to enter the labor force and contribute to the progress of industrial societies. Several factors have contributed to the system's growth to its present size and prominence in social and cultural life. The advent of new technologies has hastened the transition to a knowledge-based economy, which places a premium on education and training. The expansion of the system has also been motivated by the view that education is crucial to individual success and the maturation of democratic citizens. In today's world, there are many reasons to participate in the educational system.

In addition to its entertainment value, media also helps people become better integrated members of society by instilling in them the values and cultural understanding they'll need to thrive. A further goal is to encourage participation in public life and the preservation of democratic principles. The modern educational system is beneficial to individuals and families because it provides them with opportunities to acquire and apply knowledge and skills that can increase their economic standing and promote upward mobility. A highly educated workforce is beneficial to businesses because it increases productivity and stimulates economic growth. More money in the government's coffers and a flourishing economy are two outcomes that benefit from a well-educated populace. The benefits of today's educational system are shared by the public and the private sectors. First, it's a public good because it helps everyone by boosting employment and productivity in the economy. Education can be seen as a public good because it helps society as a whole, but it can also be seen as a private good because it helps individuals and their families. As a result of the belief that education is essential for social mobility and the development of democratic citizens, the modern educational system has grown to become large and central to social and cultural life since the advent of the industrial revolution. It aims to educate individuals on the norms, values, and cultural knowledge necessary to participate in society, as well as to promote civic engagement and democratic values.
