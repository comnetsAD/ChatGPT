Many schools now provide English Language Learner (ELL) programs to assist pupils who speak different languages at home. Features of the K-12 Education System: In the United States, the K-12 education system is largely administered by state and local governments. It consists of basic and secondary education separated into three levels: primary, middle, and secondary schools For kids aged 6 to 16, public schools are free and mandatory. Curriculum and teaching vary by state, but most include math, science, English, social studies, and foreign languages. Private schools are not government-funded and may have alternative curriculum and entrance standards.

According to studies, kids of color and low-income students had poorer academic success and graduation rates than their white and more wealthy counterparts.

The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) replaced the No Child Left Behind Act in 2015, giving states and local school districts greater flexibility over closing the performance gap. The Obama Administration's "My Brother's Keeper" campaign aims to improve outcomes for black and brown boys and young men. Some governments have developed measures to reduce the performance gap, such as California's "Weighted Student Formula," which pays more money to schools with larger numbers of low-income and minority pupils. The United States has a well-established education system in general, but there is a considerable accomplishment gap between different racial and ethnic groups, prompting numerous government policies and initiatives to address this problem.
