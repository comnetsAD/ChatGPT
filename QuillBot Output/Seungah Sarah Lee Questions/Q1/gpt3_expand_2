It is one of the most developed and industrialized countries in the world. It has a diversified population consisting of a mix of different ethnic and racial groupings. The United States of America is a federal republic with 50 states and a capital district. Instruction is almost often given in English because it is the most widely spoken language in the world. Additionally, many educational institutions provide courses and support for students who are learning English as a second language (commonly known as English Language Learners or ELLs). K-12 Education System Characteristics The K-12 education system in the United States is generally governed by the governments of the individual states and localities. Primary and secondary education are both included, and within each of those categories, there are three levels: the primary, the junior high, and the senior high schools Students between the ages of 6 and 16 are required to attend public schools, which are both free and mandatory. The curriculum and methods of education in a state might vary, but they often cover topics like mathematics, science, English, social studies, and even international languages. There are also private schools, which get no funding from the government and are free to devise their own unique educational programs and admittance standards. Concerns Regarding Education One of the primary areas of worry in the United States is the disparity in academic performance that exists between various racial and ethnic groups. Studies have indicated that children of color and kids with low incomes tend to have poorer academic success and graduation rates compared to their white and more wealthy counterparts in terms of both academic achievement and graduation rates. Principal Educational Practices, Programs, and Policies Taking Steps to Address the Problem: In order to assist low-income pupils in improving their academic performance, Title I of the "No Child Left Behind" Act allocates cash from the federal government to schools that have a high percentage of students from low-income families. In 2015, the No Child Left Behind Act was repealed and replaced by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), which grants more authority to individual states and local school districts in the effort to close the performance gap. The goal of the "My Brother's Keeper" campaign, which is being spearheaded by the Obama administration, is to make life better for black boys and young men. Some states have passed laws to address the achievement gap, such as California's "Weighted Student Formula," which gives additional funding to schools that have a higher concentration of low-income students and students of color. Other states have not taken any action to address the achievement gap. There is a considerable accomplishment gap between different racial and ethnic groups in the United States, which has spurred many policies and initiatives to be implemented by the government in order to address this issue. On the whole, the education system in the United States is well-established.
