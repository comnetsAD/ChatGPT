Brief national context: In North America, the United States is a federal republic. It consists of fifty states plus the District of Columbia. The population of the country is approximately 331 million. The United States has a population comprised of individuals from numerous ethnic, racial, and cultural backgrounds. The official language of instruction in the United States is English. However, numerous schools also offer instruction in Spanish, Mandarin, and French. The United States' K-12 education system is administered primarily by the individual states. Each state determines its own graduation and curriculum standards. Children aged 6 to 17 are required to receive a free and mandatory public education. Private schools and homeschooling are additional options available to families. The K-12 education system consists of elementary and secondary school. Education-related concern: In the United States, the achievement gap between students from different socioeconomic backgrounds is one of the most pressing educational issues. Students from low-income families tend to have lower academic achievement and graduation rates than their more affluent peers, according to studies. Principal education policies and/or programs that address the problem: The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) was enacted in 2001 with the intention of reducing the achievement gap and increasing teacher accountability. As a replacement for NCLB, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) was passed in 2015, with a focus on giving states and local communities more control over education policy. Title I funding aids schools with a high proportion of students from low-income families. Head Start provides low-income children and their families with comprehensive early childhood education, health, and nutrition services. Students from low-income families are provided with free or low-cost meals through the National School Lunch Program.
