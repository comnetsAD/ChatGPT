United States The predominant language of instruction in schools is English. Many schools also provide English Language Learner (ELL) programs to assist students who speak a language other than English at home. The K-12 education system in the United States is controlled by state and local governments primarily. It consists of the three levels of primary and secondary education: Primary, middle, and secondary school Six to sixteen-year-olds must attend free and mandatory public schools. State-specific curricula and instruction typically include math, science, English, social studies, and foreign languages. There are also private schools, which are not subsidized by the government and may have varying curricula and admission requirements. Concerning Education In the United States, the achievement gap between different racial and ethnic groups is a major concern. Compared to their white and affluent peers, students of color and low-income students tend to have lower academic achievement and graduation rates. Key Policies and Programs in Education Considering the Problem: Title I of the No Child Left Behind Act provides federal funding to schools with a high proportion of low-income students in order to enhance their academic performance. In 2015, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) replaced the No Child Left Behind Act and gave states and local school districts more control over addressing the achievement gap. The "My Brother's Keeper" initiative of the Obama Administration focuses on improving outcomes for boys and young men of color. Some states have implemented policies to address the achievement gap, such as California's "Weighted Student Formula," which provides additional funding to schools with a higher concentration of low-income and minority students. The United States has a well-established education system, but there is a significant achievement gap between racial and ethnic groups, which has prompted various government policies and programs to address this problem.
