I'll give you a breakdown of American schooling. The United States is a federal republic that can be found in North America. It has a population of about 328 million and is renowned for its rich cultural heritage. Although English is the official language, the entire nation also speaks a variety of other languages. K-12 Education System: In the United States, state and municipal governments are primarily in charge of overseeing and funding the K–12 education system. The system consists of elementary and secondary education, with the former covering kindergarten through grade five and the latter covering grades six through twelve. States and districts have different curricula and requirements, but math, science, English, social studies, and foreign languages are often prioritized. Various school kinds, including regular public schools, charter schools, and private schools, are also included in the educational system. The achievement gap—a persistent disparity in academic success and educational opportunities between various groups of students, notably those from low-income households and students of color—is one of the main concerns in the United States. Major educational policies and initiatives: A federal law known as the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) was passed in 2001 with the intention of enhancing academic attainment and holding schools responsible for pupil performance. The law has drawn criticism for its emphasis on standardized testing and its dearth of funding for underperforming schools. As a substitute for NCLB, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) was enacted in 2015. It intends to provide states and districts more latitude in how they improve schools and close the achievement gap. Schools with high percentages of low-income pupils are eligible for federal assistance under Title I of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act (ESEA). By giving resources and support to schools that most need it, this financing aims to reduce the achievement gap. Low-income children and their families can get comprehensive early childhood education, health, nutrition, and parent involvement services through the Head Start program. Overall, there are ongoing attempts to enhance student outcomes and reduce gaps in the diverse and complicated American educational system. The achievement gap is still a major concern, and policymakers and educators are still working to find solutions.
