A brief context of the country: North America is home to the nation of the United States of America, a federal republic. There are fifty states and one federal district that make up this country. It is estimated that there are approximately 331 million people living in the country. People in the United States come from a wide variety of racial, cultural, and linguistic backgrounds. This diversity can be seen in the country's population. The language of instruction in the United States is English, which is also the country's official language. Nevertheless, many schools also provide instruction in other languages such as Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, and French. In the United States, the individual states are primarily responsible for the administration of the education system from kindergarten through the twelfth grade. The minimum curricular requirements and educational benchmarks for graduation are different in each state. Children between the ages of 6 and 17 are required to attend public school and are not charged for their education. In addition to public schools and homeschooling, families also have the option of attending private schools. Primary (also known as elementary school) and secondary education (also known as high school) are both included in the K-12 educational system. Concerning an educational matter are: The achievement gap between students from different socioeconomic backgrounds is one of the most significant problems plaguing the educational system in the United States today. Studies have shown that students who come from families with lower incomes have a tendency to have lower academic achievement as well as a lower graduation rate than their peers who come from families with higher incomes. Important educational programs and/or policies that address the problem are as follows: The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) was enacted in 2001 with the intention of reducing the academic achievement gap while simultaneously increasing the level of accountability for both schools and teachers. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), which was enacted in 2015 to serve as a replacement for the No Child Left Behind Act, places an emphasis on giving states and local communities a greater degree of control over educational policy. Schools that have a significant number of students coming from low-income families are eligible to receive Title I funding, which provides financial assistance. Children and families with low incomes are eligible to participate in the Head Start program, which offers a variety of early childhood education, health, and nutrition services. Students who come from families with low incomes are eligible to receive free or reduced-cost lunches through the National School Lunch Program.
