A brief overview of the country: The United States of America is a federal republic in North America. It consists of 50 states plus the District of Columbia. The population of the country is approximately 331 million people. The population of the United States is diverse, with people of various ethnic, racial, and cultural backgrounds. English is the official language of instruction in the United States. Many schools, however, also provide instruction in languages such as Spanish, Mandarin, and French. Characteristics of the K-12 education system: The education system in the United States is primarily managed by individual states. Each state establishes its own curriculum and graduation requirements. For children aged 6 to 17, public education is free and mandatory. Families can also choose between private schools and homeschooling. Primary (elementary) and secondary (high) school education are included in the K-12 education system. Concerns about education: The achievement gap between students from different socioeconomic backgrounds is one of the most serious educational issues in the United States. According to studies, students from low-income families perform worse academically and graduate at a lower rate than their more affluent peers. Important educational policies and/or programs addressing the issue include: The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) was enacted in 2001 to close the achievement gap and increase accountability for schools and teachers. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) was passed in 2015 to replace NCLB, with a focus on giving states and local communities more control over education policy. Title I funding is given to schools that have a high percentage of students from low-income families. The Head Start program provides low-income children and families with comprehensive early childhood education, health, and nutrition services. Students from low-income families can get free or low-cost meals through the National School Lunch Program.
