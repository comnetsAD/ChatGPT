The United States is a federal republic consisting of 50 states plus the District of Columbia. It is one of the most advanced and industrialized nations in the world. Its population is made up of people of many different races and ethnicities. The majority of classroom instruction is conducted in English. Schools often provide English Language Learner (ELL) programs for kids whose families speak languages other than English at home. Key Elements of the K-12 Educational System: In the United States, state and local governments have primary responsibility for the public school system that serves children from kindergarten through grade twelve. It consists of three distinct stages of primary and secondary schooling: Primary, Junior High, and Senior High Students between the ages of 6 and 16 must attend public schools at no cost to them. Math, science, English, history, and geography are just some of the subjects typically taught in public schools across the country. However, there is another option: private schools, which operate independently from the government and thus can set their own policies regarding curriculum and student admission. The achievement gap between racial and ethnic groups is a serious problem in American education. Research shows that students of color and students from low-income backgrounds are less likely to succeed academically and graduate high school than their white and middle-class peers. Critical Policies and Programs in Education Taking Care of the Problem: According to Title I of the No Child Left Behind Act, federal funding is allocated to schools with a high percentage of low-income students in order to raise their overall academic performance. Since its passage in 2015, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) has given states and local school districts more leeway to close the achievement gap. With its "My Brother's Keeper" program, the Obama administration is working to better the lives of black boys and young men. To close the academic opportunity gap, some states have enacted policies like California's "Weighted Student Formula," which allocates additional funds to schools with a disproportionate number of students from low-income families or students of color. While the United States as a whole has a robust educational infrastructure, disparities in educational attainment among the country's many racial and ethnic groups have prompted a number of government initiatives.
