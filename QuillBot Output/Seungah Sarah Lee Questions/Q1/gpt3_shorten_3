Country context: The United States is a federal republic with 50 states and a capital district. It is one of the most developed and industrialized nations in the world and has a diversified population of ethnic and racial groupings. Schools teach in English. ELL programs aid kids who speak different languages at home. K-12 Education System: State and local governments run the US K-12 education system. Primary and secondary education have three levels: elementary, middle, and high Free public schools are mandatory for 6â€“16-year-olds. State-specific curricula include arithmetic, science, English, social studies, and foreign languages. Private schools have varied curriculum and entrance standards. Education Problem: Racial and ethnic attainment gaps are a serious issue in the US. Studies reveal that kids of color and low-income students have lower academic success and graduation rates than white and wealthier students. Educational Policies Problem-solving: Title I of the No Child Left Behind Act helps low-income schools improve academically. In 2015, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) replaced the No Child Left Behind Act and gave states and districts greater flexibility over closing the performance gap. The Obama Administration's "My Brother's Keeper" project improves outcomes for boys and young men of color. California's "Weighted Student Formula" gives low-income and minority schools additional funds to close the performance gap. Despite a large accomplishment difference across racial and ethnic groupings, the US education system is well-established.
