Brief national context: In North America, the United States is a federal republic. It consists of fifty states plus the District of Columbia. The population of the country is roughly 331 million. The United States has a population comprised of individuals from numerous ethnic, racial, and cultural backgrounds. The official language of teaching in the United States is English. However, numerous schools now offer education in Spanish, Mandarin, and French. The United States' K-12 education system is controlled mostly by the various states. Each state determines its own graduation and curricular standards. Children aged 6 to 17 are required to get a free and mandatory public education. Private schools and homeschooling are other options available to families. The K-12 education system consists of elementary and secondary school. Education-related concern: In the United States, the achievement gap between pupils from different socioeconomic origins is one of the most pressing educational challenges. Students from low-income homes tend to have poorer academic attainment and graduation rates than their more affluent counterparts, according to studies. Principal education policies and/or programs that address the problem: The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) was enacted in 2001 with the intention of reducing the achievement gap and boosting teacher accountability. As a substitute for NCLB, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) was passed in 2015, with a focus on giving states and local communities more autonomy over education policy. Title I financing aids schools with a high proportion of children from low-income families. Head Start serves low-income children and their families with comprehensive early childhood education, health, and nutrition programs. Students from low-income families are provided with free or low-cost lunches through the National School Lunch Program.
