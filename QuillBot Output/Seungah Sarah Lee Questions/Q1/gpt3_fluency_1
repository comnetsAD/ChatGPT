The United States is a federal republic with 50 states and a capital district. It is one of the world's most developed and industrialized countries. It has a diversified population comprised of various ethnic and racial groupings. Language of Instruction: The major language of instruction in schools is English. Many schools now provide English Language Learner (ELL) programs to assist pupils who speak different languages at home. Features of the K-12 Education System: In the United States, the K-12 education system is primarily administered by state and local governments. It consists of primary and secondary education separated into three levels: primary, middle, and secondary schools For kids aged 6 to 16, public schools are free and mandatory. Curriculum and instruction differ by state, but most include math, science, English, social studies, and foreign languages. Private schools are not government-funded and may have alternative curricula and entrance standards. One important source of concern in the United States is the attainment gap between different racial and ethnic groups. According to studies, kids of color and low-income students had poorer academic achievement and graduation rates than their white and more affluent peers. Important Educational Policies and Programs Taking Care of the Problem: Title I of the No Child Left Behind Act allocates federal funds to schools with a high concentration of low-income pupils in order to help them improve their academic performance. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) replaced the No Child Left Behind Act in 2015, giving states and local school districts more flexibility over closing the performance gap. The Obama Administration's "My Brother's Keeper" campaign aims to improve outcomes for black and brown boys and young men. Some governments have developed policies to reduce the achievement gap, such as California's "Weighted Student Formula," which pays more funding to schools with higher numbers of low-income and minority pupils. The United States has a well-established education system in general, but there is a considerable accomplishment gap between different racial and ethnic groups, prompting various government policies and programs to address this issue.
