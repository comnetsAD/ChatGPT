I'll profile US education. North American federal republic: the US. It boasts 328 million inhabitants with a rich culture and history. English is the national language, but many others are spoken. State and local governments operate the K-12 education system in the US, with some federal financing and control. Primary education runs from kindergarten through grade 5 and secondary from grade 6 to 12. Math, science, English, social studies, and foreign languages are often stressed in state and district curricula. The education system comprises public, charter, and private schools. Education Issue: The achievement gap—the ongoing academic achievement and educational opportunity gaps between different groups of students, notably low-income and minority students—is a serious issue in the US. Education Policies: The 2001 No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) sought to boost academic performance and hold schools accountable. The law has been criticized for its concentration on standardized testing and lack of assistance for failing schools. ESSA replaced NCLB in 2015. It gives states and districts more freedom to improve schools and close the achievement gap. Title I of the ESEA funds low-income schools. By supporting underfunded schools, this money aims to reduce the achievement gap. Low-income children and families get early childhood education, health, nutrition, and parent participation via Head Start. The US education system is varied and complicated, with continual initiatives to enhance student performance and address inequities. Policymakers and educators continue to address the achievement gap.
