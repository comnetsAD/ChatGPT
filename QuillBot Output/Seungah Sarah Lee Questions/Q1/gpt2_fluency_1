A brief overview of the country: The United States of America is a federal republic in North America. It consists of 50 states plus the District of Columbia. The population of the country is roughly 331 million people. The population of the United States is varied, with people of various ethnic, racial, and cultural backgrounds. English is the official language of education in the United States. Many schools, however, also provide teaching in languages such as Spanish, Mandarin, and French. Characteristics of the K-12 education system: The education system in the United States is mostly managed by individual states. Each state has its own curriculum and graduation criteria. For youngsters aged 6 to 17, public education is free and mandatory. Families can also choose between private schools and homeschooling. Primary (elementary) and secondary (high) school education are included in the K-12 education system. Concerns about education: The achievement gap between pupils from different socioeconomic origins is one of the most serious educational challenges in the United States. According to studies, students from low-income homes perform worse academically and graduate at a lower rate than their more affluent peers. Important educational initiatives and/or programs addressing the topic include: The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) was enacted in 2001 to close the achievement gap and increase responsibility for schools and teachers. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) was passed in 2015 to replace NCLB, with a focus on giving states and local communities more autonomy over education policy. Title I funding is given to schools that have a high percentage of children from low-income families. The Head Start program provides low-income children and families with comprehensive early childhood education, health, and nutrition services. Students from low-income families can get free or low-cost lunches through the National School Lunch Program.
