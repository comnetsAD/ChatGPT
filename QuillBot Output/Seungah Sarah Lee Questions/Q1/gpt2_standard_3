Detailed national context In North America, there is a federal republic called the United States. It consists of the District of Columbia and 50 states. There are around 331 million people living in the nation. The population of the United States is varied, consisting of individuals from several various ethnic, racial, and cultural origins. English is the official language of the United States and is used in educational settings. However, several schools also provide teaching in tongues including French, Mandarin, and Spanish. Features of the K–12 education system: The states in the United States are largely responsible for managing the education system. Each state has its own graduation criteria and curricular standards. Between the ages of 6 and 17, public education is free and required. Families have the choice of homeschooling or private schools. Both primary (elementary) and secondary (high) school education are part of the K–12 educational system. Concerning topic in education: The achievement gap between pupils from various socioeconomic origins is one of the largest challenges in American education. According to studies, kids from low-income homes often do less well in school and graduate at a lower rate than their more wealthy counterparts. Important educational policies and/or initiatives to address the problem: The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), which was enacted in 2001, aims to reduce the achievement gap and raise teacher and school accountability. As a substitute for NCLB, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) was enacted in 2015 with an emphasis on giving states and local communities greater autonomy over educational policy. Schools receiving a large proportion of their pupils from low-income households under Title I financing get financial support. Low-income children and families may get comprehensive early childhood education, health, and nutrition services via the Head Start program. Students from low-income households may get free or inexpensive meals via the National School Lunch Program.
