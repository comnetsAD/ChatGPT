English is the official language of the United States and is used in educational settings. However, numerous schools also provide instruction in tongues including French, Mandarin, and Spanish. Features of the K–12 education system: The states in the United States are primarily responsible for managing the education system. Each state establishes its own graduation requirements and curricular standards. Between the ages of 6 and 17, public education is free and required. Families have the choice of homeschooling or private schools. Both primary (elementary) and secondary (high) school education are part of the K–12 educational system. Concerning topic in education: The achievement gap between pupils from various socioeconomic origins is one of the largest challenges in American education. According to studies, students from low-income homes typically perform less well in school and graduate at a lower rate than their more affluent peers. Important educational policies and/or initiatives to address the problem: The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), which was passed in 2001, aims to reduce the achievement gap and raise teacher and school accountability. As a substitute for NCLB, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) was passed in 2015 with a focus on giving states and local communities more autonomy over educational policy. Schools receiving a large proportion of their pupils from low-income households under Title I financing receive financial support. Low-income children and families can get comprehensive early childhood education, health, and nutrition services through the Head Start program. Students from low-income families can receive free or inexpensive meals through the National School Lunch Program.
