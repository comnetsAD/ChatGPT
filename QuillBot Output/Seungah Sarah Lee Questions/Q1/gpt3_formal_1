United States The predominant language of instruction in schools is English. Many schools now provide English Language Learner (ELL) programs to assist pupils who speak a language other than English at home. The K-12 education system in the United States is overseen by state and local governments primarily. It consists of the three levels of primary and secondary education: Primary, middle, and secondary school Six to sixteen-year-olds must attend free and mandatory public schools. State-specific curricula and instruction often include math, science, English, social studies, and foreign languages. There are also private schools, which are not subsidized by the government and may have varying curricula and admission standards. Concerning Education In the United States, the accomplishment gap between different racial and ethnic groups is a serious worry. Compared to their white and wealthier peers, kids of color and low-income students tend to have poorer academic achievement and graduation rates. Key Policies and Programs in Education Considering the Problem: Title I of the No Child Left Behind Act offers federal financing to schools with a high proportion of low-income kids in order to enhance their academic performance. In 2015, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) replaced the No Child Left Behind Act and gave states and local school districts more flexibility over tackling the performance gap. The "My Brother's Keeper" initiative of the Obama Administration focuses on improving outcomes for boys and young men of color. Some governments have established policies to reduce the achievement gap, such as California's "Weighted Student Formula," which distributes additional funding to schools with a higher concentration of low-income and minority pupils. The United States has a well-established education system, but there is a considerable accomplishment gap between racial and ethnic groups, which has inspired many government policies and programs to address this problem.
