The United States is a federal republic with 50 states and a capital district. It is one of the world's most developed and industrialized countries. It has a diverse population comprised of various ethnic and racial groups. Language of Instruction: The primary language of instruction in schools is English. Many schools also provide English Language Learner (ELL) programs to assist students who speak other languages at home. Features of the K-12 Education System: In the United States, the K-12 education system is primarily controlled by state and local governments. It consists of primary and secondary education divided into three levels: primary, middle, and secondary schools For students aged 6 to 16, public schools are free and mandatory. Curriculum and instruction differ by state, but most include math, science, English, social studies, and foreign languages. Private schools are not government-funded and may have different curricula and admission requirements. One major source of concern in the United States is the achievement gap between different racial and ethnic groups. According to studies, students of color and low-income students have lower academic achievement and graduation rates than their white and more affluent peers. Important Educational Policies and Programs Taking Care of the Problem: Title I of the No Child Left Behind Act allocates federal funds to schools with a high concentration of low-income students in order to help them improve their academic performance. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) replaced the No Child Left Behind Act in 2015, giving states and local school districts more control over closing the achievement gap. The Obama Administration's "My Brother's Keeper" initiative aims to improve outcomes for black and brown boys and young men. Some states have implemented policies to address the achievement gap, such as California's "Weighted Student Formula," which provides more funding to schools with higher concentrations of low-income and minority students. The United States has a well-established education system in general, but there is a significant achievement gap between different racial and ethnic groups, prompting various government policies and programs to address this issue.
