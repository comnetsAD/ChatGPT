A brief background of the country: North America is home to the nation of the United States of America, a federal republic. There are fifty states and one federal district that make up this country. It is estimated that there are roughly 331 million people living in the nation. People in the United States come from a wide variety of racial, cultural, and linguistic origins. This diversity can be seen in the country's population. The language of education in the United States is English, which is also the country's official language. Nevertheless, many schools also provide education in other languages such as Mandarin Chinese, Spanish, and French. In the United States, the individual states are principally responsible for the administration of the education system from kindergarten through the twelfth grade. The minimum curricular requirements and educational benchmarks for graduation are different in each state. Children between the ages of 6 and 17 are required to attend public school and are not charged for their education. In addition to public schools and homeschooling, families also have the option of attending private schools. Primary (also known as elementary school) and secondary education (also known as high school) are both included in the K-12 educational system. Concerning an educational matter are: The performance gap between pupils from various socioeconomic origins is one of the most significant problems plaguing the educational system in the United States today. Studies have indicated that kids who originate from households with lower incomes have a tendency to have worse academic success as well as a lower graduation rate than their counterparts who come from families with higher incomes. Important educational initiatives and/or policies that address the problem are as follows: The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) was enacted in 2001 with the intention of reducing the academic performance gap while simultaneously improving the level of responsibility for both schools and teachers. The Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), which was enacted in 2015 to serve as a substitute for the No Child Left Behind Act, places an emphasis on giving states and local communities a greater degree of influence over educational policy. Schools that have a significant number of children coming from low-income homes are eligible to receive Title I money, which offers financial support. Children and families with low incomes are eligible to participate in the Head Start program, which offers a variety of early childhood education, health, and nutrition programs. Students who come from households with low incomes are eligible to receive free or reduced-cost lunches under the National School Lunch Program.
