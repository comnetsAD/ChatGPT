I'll profile US education. North American federal republic: the US. It has 328 million people and a diverse culture and history. English is the national language, but many others are spoken. State and local governments run the K-12 education system in the US, with some federal funding and oversight. Primary education runs from kindergarten to grade 5 and secondary from grade 6 to 12. Math, science, English, social studies, and foreign languages are typically stressed in state and district curricula. The education system includes public, charter, and private schools. Education Issue: The achievement gap—the persistent academic achievement and educational opportunity gaps between different groups of students, particularly low-income and minority students—is a major issue in the US. Education Policies: The 2001 No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) sought to boost academic performance and hold schools accountable. The law has been criticized for its focus on standardized testing and lack of resources for struggling schools. ESSA replaced NCLB in 2015. It gives states and districts more flexibility to improve schools and close the achievement gap. Title I of the ESEA funds low-income schools. By supporting underfunded schools, this funding aims to close the achievement gap. Low-income children and families receive early childhood education, health, nutrition, and parent involvement through Head Start. The US education system is diverse and complex, with ongoing efforts to improve student outcomes and address disparities. Policymakers and educators continue to address the achievement gap.
