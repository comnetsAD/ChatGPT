The United States is a federal republic with 50 states and a capital district. It is one of the most industrialized and developed nations in the world. Its population is diverse, consisting of a mixture of various ethnic and racial groups. English is used in schools primarily as a language of instruction. In order to assist students who speak other languages at home, many schools also provide programs for English Language Learners (ELLs). Features of K-12 Education System: State and local governments are primarily in charge of the K-12 education system in the United States. There are three levels of primary, secondary, and postsecondary education in it: primary, middle, and secondary education For students between the ages of 6 and 16, attending public schools is free and required. The subjects covered in the curriculum and instruction vary from state to state but typically include math, science, English, social studies, and foreign languages. Additionally, there are private schools, which may have different admission standards and funding sources than public ones. The achievement gap between various racial and ethnic groups in the United States is a significant issue of concern. According to studies, low-income and students of color frequently perform less well academically and graduate at a lower rate than their white and more affluent peers. Important Educational Policies and Initiatives Taking on the Problem: To help low-income students perform better academically, Title I of the No Child Left Behind Act provides federal funding to schools with high concentrations of these students. The No Child Left Behind Act was replaced by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in 2015, and it gives states and local school districts more control over how to close the achievement gap. The "My Brother's Keeper" initiative of the Obama administration is dedicated to enhancing outcomes for boys and young men of color. The "Weighted Student Formula" in California, which gives more funding to schools with higher concentrations of low-income students and students of color, is one of the policies that some states have put into place to address the achievement gap. Overall, the education system in the United States is well-established, but there is a sizable achievement gap between various racial and ethnic groups, which has led to the creation of numerous government policies and programs to address this problem.
