The United States is a federal republic with 50 states and a capital district. It is one of the most industrialized and developed nations in the world. Its population is diversified, consisting of a mixture of many ethnic and racial groupings. English is used in schools primarily as a language of teaching. In order to assist pupils who speak different languages at home, many schools now provide programs for English Language Learners (ELLs). Features of K-12 Education System: State and municipal governments are generally in charge of the K-12 education system in the United States. There are three stages of elementary, intermediate, and postsecondary education in it: primary, middle, and secondary education For pupils between the ages of 6 and 16, attending public schools is free and required. The courses included in the curriculum and teaching vary from state to state but often include math, science, English, social studies, and foreign languages. Additionally, there are private schools, which may have different entrance standards and funding sources than public ones. The achievement gap between various racial and ethnic groups in the United States is a significant matter of concern. According to studies, low-income and pupils of color often do less well academically and graduate at a lower rate than their white and more wealthy counterparts. Important Educational Policies and Initiatives Taking on the Problem: To assist low-income kids perform better academically, Title I of the No Child Left Behind Act gives federal funds to schools with large concentrations of these pupils. The No Child Left Behind Act was superseded with the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) in 2015, and it allows states and local school districts greater choice over how to close the performance gap. The "My Brother's Keeper" project of the Obama administration is dedicated to improving outcomes for boys and young men of color. The "Weighted Student Formula" in California, which gives more financing to schools with larger numbers of low-income children and kids of color, is one of the policies that some states have put into place to combat the performance gap. Overall, the education system in the United States is well-established, but there is a sizable accomplishment gap between various racial and ethnic groups, which has led to the creation of several government policies and initiatives to address this problem.
