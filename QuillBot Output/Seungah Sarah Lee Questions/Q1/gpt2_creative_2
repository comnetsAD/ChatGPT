Basically, the country is: The United States of America is a constitutional republic in the North American continent. There are 50 states and DC that make up this country. Approximately 331 million people call this place home. People of many different races, cultures, and ethnicities live in the United States. English is used as the medium of teaching since it is the official language of the United States. However, many institutions of higher learning now provide tuition in other languages, including Spanish, Mandarin Chinese, and French. The United States' K-12 education system is characterized by a high degree of autonomy on the part of the different states. Graduation criteria and educational benchmarks are determined on a state-by-state basis. Children between the ages of 6 and 17 must attend public school for free. When it comes to education, parents also have the choice of sending their children to private schools or teaching them at home. Education from kindergarten through twelfth grade is referred to as the "K-12" system. Among the problems in the field of education: The achievement gap between pupils of different socioeconomic origins is one of the most pressing problems in American education today. Students from low-income backgrounds have been proven to do worse academically and graduate at lower rates than their more affluent counterparts. Important educational initiatives and/or policies that aim to address the issue: The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) was enacted in 2001 with the intention of reducing the academic performance gap and raising the bar for institutional responsibility. The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB) was repealed in 2015 and replaced by the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA), which gives states and local communities more say over education policy. Schools that serve a large population of kids from low-income households can apply for Title I money to help offset the costs of educating these pupils. Children from low-income families can receive help with their development, health, and nutrition through the Head Start program. Students from low-income households can get free or reduced-price lunches through the National School Lunch Program.
