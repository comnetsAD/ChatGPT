Detailed national context In North America, there is a federal republic called the United States. It consists of the District of Columbia and 50 states. There are approximately 331 million people living in the nation. The population of the United States is diverse, consisting of individuals from numerous different ethnic, racial, and cultural backgrounds. English is the official language of the United States and is used in educational settings. However, numerous schools also provide instruction in tongues like French, Mandarin, and Spanish. Features of the K–12 education system: The states in the United States are primarily responsible for managing the education system. Each state establishes its own graduation requirements and curriculum standards. Between the ages of 6 and 17, public education is free and required. Families have the option of homeschooling or private schools. Both primary (elementary) and secondary (high) school education are part of the K–12 educational system. Concerning issue in education: The achievement gap between students from various socioeconomic backgrounds is one of the biggest issues in American education. According to studies, students from low-income families typically perform less well in school and graduate at a lower rate than their more affluent peers. Important educational policies and/or initiatives to address the problem: The No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB), which was passed in 2001, aims to reduce the achievement gap and raise teacher and school accountability. As a replacement for NCLB, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) was passed in 2015 with a focus on giving states and local communities more control over educational policy. Schools receiving a high proportion of their students from low-income families under Title I funding receive financial support. Low-income children and families can receive comprehensive early childhood education, health, and nutrition services through the Head Start program. Students from low-income families can receive free or inexpensive meals through the National School Lunch Program.
