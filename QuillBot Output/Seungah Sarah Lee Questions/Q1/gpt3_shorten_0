Country context: The United States is a federal republic with 50 states and a capital district. It is one of the most developed and industrialized nations in the world and has a diverse population of ethnic and racial groups. Schools teach in English. ELL programs help students who speak other languages at home. K-12 Education System: State and local governments run the US K-12 education system. Primary and secondary education have three levels: elementary, middle, and high Free public schools are mandatory for 6â€“16-year-olds. State-specific curricula include math, science, English, social studies, and foreign languages. Private schools have different curricula and admission requirements. Education Issue: Racial and ethnic achievement gaps are a major issue in the US. Studies show that students of color and low-income students have lower academic achievement and graduation rates than white and wealthier students. Educational Policies Problem-solving: Title I of the No Child Left Behind Act helps low-income schools improve academically. In 2015, the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) replaced the No Child Left Behind Act and gave states and districts more control over closing the achievement gap. The Obama Administration's "My Brother's Keeper" initiative improves outcomes for boys and young men of color. California's "Weighted Student Formula" gives low-income and minority schools more funding to close the achievement gap. Despite a large achievement gap between racial and ethnic groups, the US education system is well-established.
