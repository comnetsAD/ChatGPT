Schooling can affect social inequality. Education can reduce social, structural inequalities by giving people the knowledge, skills, and abilities to function in society and improve their social and economic status. Education also helps people escape poverty and disadvantage. Education can also reproduce social and economic inequality. In several ways: Schooling: Social and economic inequality can persist if marginalized groups lack education. When schools are underfunded, resource-poor, or in poor, crime-ridden neighborhoods, this can happen. Curriculum and instruction: By failing to teach students the knowledge, skills, and abilities they need to function in society or by teaching a biased version of history and culture, schools can perpetuate social and economic inequality. When the curriculum is not culturally responsive or tailored to different student groups, this can happen. Tracking and streaming: Sorting students into academic programs based on ability can perpetuate social and economic inequality. This can result in marginalized and disadvantaged students being placed in lower-level classes and denied advanced opportunities. Teacher bias: Teachers who limit the potential of marginalized and disadvantaged students perpetuate social and economic inequality. When teachers don't support or expect certain students, this can happen. Finally, education and schooling can affect social inequality. Education can perpetuate or reduce social, structural inequalities. Recognizing how education perpetuates social and economic inequality and working to create a more equitable education system that promotes social mobility and equal opportunities for all students is crucial.
