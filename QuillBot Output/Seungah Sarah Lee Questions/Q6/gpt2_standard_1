As it can both increase and decrease societal social and structural imbalances, education and schooling can have a substantial impact on issues of equity. On the one hand, education can maintain current social and structural inequalities by reproducing power dynamics and giving certain pupils an edge while lagging behind others. For instance, low-income kids and students of color are more likely to attend underfunded schools with fewer possibilities for extracurricular and academic activities, which can result in lower academic attainment and graduation rates. On the other hand, education can lessen current social and structural inequalities by giving people the information, competencies, and opportunities for social and economic advancement that they need to function in society. By equipping people with the critical thinking abilities needed to question preexisting power structures and act toward social justice, education can also aid in the promotion of social change. In the development of personal, social, and cultural capital, education is equally crucial. The information, skills, and aptitudes that people develop via education and training, which can raise their economic productivity and earning potential, are referred to as human capital. The networks and resources that people have access to, which can potentially raise their economic productivity and earning potential, are referred to as social capital. The information, skills, and aptitudes that people gain via education and training, which can elevate their social and economic status, are referred to as cultural capital. Overall, depending on how education is designed and executed, it can have both favorable and unfavorable effects on issues of equity. By duplicating existing power relations and favoring certain pupils while excluding others, education can maintain social and structural inequalities. On the other hand, by giving people the knowledge, skills, and talents necessary to operate in society and by presenting chances for social and economic growth, education can help lessen the social and structural injustices that already exist. In the development of personal, social, and cultural capital, education is equally crucial.
