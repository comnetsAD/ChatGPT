Education and schooling can have a substantial impact on issues of inequity since they can both perpetuate and reduce existing social and structural imbalances in society. On the one hand, education has the potential to perpetuate existing social and structural injustices by reproducing existing power dynamics and favoring some pupils while leaving others behind. Children from low-income households and students of color, for example, are more likely to attend under-resourced schools with less academic and extracurricular opportunities, which can contribute to lower academic attainment and graduation rates. Education, on the other hand, has the potential to lessen existing social and structural inequalities by providing individuals with the knowledge, skills, and talents required to operate in society, as well as possibilities for social and economic success. Education can also serve to foster social change by equipping people with the critical thinking skills they need to challenge existing power dynamics and work for social justice. Education also contributes significantly to the accumulation of personal, social, and cultural wealth. Human capital refers to the information, skills, and abilities that people gain via education and training that can boost their economic productivity and earning potential. Individuals' social capital refers to the networks and resources to which they have access, which can boost their economic productivity and earning potential. Cultural capital refers to the information, skills, and abilities that people gain via education and training, which can help them advance in their social and economic lives. Overall, depending on how education is structured and executed, education and schooling can have both beneficial and negative repercussions for issues of unfairness. Education has the potential to perpetuate existing social and structural injustices by reproducing existing power relations and giving some pupils advantages while leaving others behind.
