Education and education may both perpetuate and eliminate existing social and structural inequalities in society, hence having substantial effects on issues of inequality. On the one hand, education may prolong existing social and structural inequalities by duplicating existing power relations and benefiting certain pupils while leaving others behind. Children from low-income households and students of color, for instance, are more likely to attend under-resourced schools with less academic and extracurricular options, which may contribute to poorer academic success and graduation rates. Alternatively, education may lessen existing social and structural inequalities by equipping people with the information, skills, and talents necessary to operate in society and by giving possibilities for social and economic growth. Education may also promote social change by equipping people with the critical thinking skills necessary to question current power structures and advance social fairness. The growth of personal, social, and cultural capital is also greatly influenced by education. Human capital refers to the information, skills, and talents acquired by people via education and training, which may boost their economic productivity and earning potential. Social capital refers to the networks and resources to which people have access, which may boost their economic productivity and earning potential. Cultural capital refers to the information, skills, and talents that people gain via education and training, which may elevate their social and economic standing. Education and schooling may have both beneficial and bad effects on issues of inequality, depending on the form and implementation of education. By duplicating existing power relations and offering benefits to certain students while leaving others behind, education may perpetuate preexisting social and structural inequalities. Conversely, education may lessen existing social and structural inequalities by equipping people with the information, skills, and talents necessary to operate in society and by giving possibilities for social and economic growth. The growth of personal, social, and cultural capital is also greatly influenced by education.
