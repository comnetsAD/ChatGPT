Low-income and marginalized students often attend under-resourced schools and struggle academically.

Human, social, and cultural capital—essential for personal and societal advancement—can be gained through education. Education can promote social and economic equality by providing access and opportunities to accumulate resources. Note that certain groups are more likely to face barriers to education, such as lack of resources, discrimination, and bias. This can exacerbate socioeconomic inequality. Thus, education must be inclusive, responsive to diverse communities, and promote equity and social justice. Education and schooling can perpetuate and reduce social, structural inequalities.
