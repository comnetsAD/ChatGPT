As it may both increase and decrease societal social and structural imbalances, education and schooling can have a substantial impact on issues of equality. On the one hand, education may maintain current social and structural inequalities by repeating power dynamics and giving certain pupils an edge while lagging behind others. For instance, low-income kids and students of color are more likely to attend underfunded schools with less possibilities for extracurricular and academic activities, which can result in poorer academic attainment and graduation rates. On the other hand, education may lessen current social and structural inequalities by giving people the information, competencies, and chances for social and economic progress that they need to operate in society. By equipping people with the critical thinking abilities needed to question preexisting power structures and act for social justice, education may also aid in the promotion of social change. In the development of personal, social, and cultural capital, education is equally crucial. The information, skills, and aptitudes that people develop via education and training, which can raise their economic productivity and earning potential, are referred to as human capital. The networks and resources that people have access to, which may potentially raise their economic productivity and earning potential, are referred to as social capital. The information, skills, and aptitudes that people gain via education and training, which can elevate their social and economic position, are referred to as cultural capital. Overall, depending on how education is designed and executed, it may have both favorable and unfavorable effects on issues of equity. By duplicating existing power relations and favoring certain pupils while excluding others, education can maintain social and structural inequalities. On the other hand, by giving people the information, skills, and talents necessary to operate in society and by presenting chances for social and economic growth, education may help lessen the social and structural injustices that already exist. In the development of personal, social, and cultural capital, education is equally crucial.
