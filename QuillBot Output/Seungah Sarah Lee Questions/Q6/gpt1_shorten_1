Education and schooling affect inequality. Education can prolong or decrease social, structural inequalities. Education can reproduce social and economic inequalities. Low-income and underprivileged students generally attend under-resourced schools and struggle academically. This limits these pupils' human, social, and cultural capital, perpetuating inequities and limiting their upward mobility. Education can also reduce inequalities by equipping people with the knowledge, skills, and abilities they need to operate in society and promote upward mobility. Human, social, and cultural capital—essential for personal and societal advancement—can be gained through education. Education can promote social and economic equality by offering access and chances to collect resources. Note that certain groups are more likely to experience challenges to education, such as lack of resources, discrimination, and bias. This can exacerbate socioeconomic inequality. Thus, education must be inclusive, attentive to varied populations, and promote equity and social justice. Education and schooling can perpetuate and ameliorate social, structural inequalities. How education is designed and delivered affects disparity. Education can promote social and economic equality by offering access to human, social, and cultural capital, but it must also be acknowledged that it can perpetuate existing imbalances.
