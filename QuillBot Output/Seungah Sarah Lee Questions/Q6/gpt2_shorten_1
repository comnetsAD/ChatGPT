Low-income and minority students are more likely to attend under-resourced schools with less academic and extracurricular opportunities, which can affect academic success and graduation rates. However, education can diminish social, structural inequalities by giving people the knowledge, skills, and chances to succeed in society. Education gives people the critical thinking abilities to confront power relations and work for social justice. Education helps build human, social, and cultural capital.

Education can also alleviate social, structural inequalities by giving people the knowledge, skills, and abilities they need to operate in society and provide possibilities for social and economic growth.
