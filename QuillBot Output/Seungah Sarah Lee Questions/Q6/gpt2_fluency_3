Education and education may have a substantial impact on issues of injustice since they can both perpetuate and eliminate existing social and structural imbalances in society. On the one hand, education has the potential to perpetuate existing social and structural injustices by repeating existing power relations and favoring certain pupils while leaving others behind. Children from low-income households and students of color, for example, are more likely to attend under-resourced schools with less academic and extracurricular options, which may contribute to poorer academic attainment and graduation rates. Education, on the other hand, has the potential to lessen existing social and structural inequalities by providing people with the information, skills, and talents required to operate in society, as well as possibilities for social and economic success. Education may also serve to foster social change by equipping people with the critical thinking skills they need to question current power relations and strive for social justice. Education also contributes significantly to the accumulation of personal, social, and cultural wealth. Human capital refers to the information, skills, and talents that people gain via education and training that may boost their economic productivity and earning potential. Individuals' social capital refers to the networks and resources to which they have access, which may boost their economic productivity and earning potential. Cultural capital refers to the information, skills, and talents that people gain via education and training, which may help them advance in their social and economic lives. Overall, depending on how education is designed and executed, education and schooling may have both beneficial and bad repercussions for issues of unfairness.
