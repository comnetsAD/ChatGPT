Education and schooling can have significant implications for issues of inequality because it has the ability to either perpetuate or reduce the existing social and structural inequities that exist in society. On the one hand, education has the potential to perpetuate pre-existing social and structural inequities. It does this by reproducing the power dynamics that already exist and by giving some students advantages while others fall further behind. Students of color and students from families with low incomes, for instance, are more likely to attend under-resourced schools. These schools offer fewer opportunities for academic and extracurricular activities, which can lead to lower academic achievement and graduation rates. On the other hand, education has the potential to reduce existing social and structural inequalities. It does this by equipping individuals with the information, skills, and capabilities they need to function in society, as well as by providing opportunities for advancement in social and economic spheres. Education can also help to promote social change by providing individuals with the critical thinking skills necessary to challenge existing power dynamics and work toward social justice. This is one way in which education can contribute to the promotion of social change. Education is also an essential component in the formation of human, social, and cultural capital, and plays an important part in all three. The term "human capital" refers to the information, capabilities, and competencies that individuals can increase their economic productivity and earning potential by acquiring through the process of education and training. Individuals' economic productivity and earning potential, as well as the networks and resources to which they have access, are both factors that are considered to be components of their social capital. A person's social and economic status can be improved through the acquisition of cultural capital, which is comprised of the knowledge, abilities, and skills that they gain as a result of their participation in educational and training programs. In general, education and schooling can have both positive and negative implications for issues pertaining to inequity, depending on the structure and implementation of education. Through the reproduction of existing power dynamics and the provision of advantages to some students while others are left behind, education has the potential to contribute to the maintenance of preexisting social and structural inequalities. On the other hand, education has the potential to reduce pre-existing social and structural inequalities. It does this by equipping individuals with the information, skills, and capabilities they need to function effectively in society, as well as by opening doors to opportunities for social and economic advancement. Education is also an essential component in the formation of human, social, and cultural capital, and plays an important part in all three.
