Education and schooling can both perpetuate and reduce existing social and structural inequalities in society, thereby having significant effects on issues of inequality. On the one hand, education can perpetuate existing social and structural inequalities by reproducing existing power dynamics and benefiting some students while leaving others behind. Students from low-income families and students of color, for instance, are more likely to attend under-resourced schools with fewer academic and extracurricular opportunities, which can lead to lower academic achievement and graduation rates. Alternatively, education can reduce existing social and structural inequalities by equipping individuals with the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to function in society and by providing opportunities for social and economic advancement. Education can also promote social change by equipping individuals with the critical thinking skills necessary to challenge existing power structures and advance social justice. The accumulation of human, social, and cultural capital is also greatly influenced by education. Human capital refers to the knowledge, skills, and abilities acquired by individuals through education and training, which can increase their economic productivity and earning potential. Social capital refers to the networks and resources to which individuals have access, which can boost their economic productivity and earning potential. Cultural capital refers to the knowledge, skills, and abilities that people acquire through education and training, which can elevate their social and economic standing. Education and schooling can have both positive and negative effects on issues of inequality, depending on the structure and implementation of education. By reproducing existing power dynamics and providing advantages to some students while leaving others behind, education can perpetuate preexisting social and structural inequalities. Conversely, education can reduce existing social and structural inequalities by equipping individuals with the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to function in society and by providing opportunities for social and economic advancement. The accumulation of human, social, and cultural capital is also greatly influenced by education.
