As it can both increase and decrease societal social and structural inequities, education and schooling can have a significant impact on issues of equity. On the one hand, education can maintain current social and structural inequalities by reproducing power dynamics and giving some students an advantage while lagging behind others. For instance, low-income students and students of color are more likely to attend underfunded schools with fewer opportunities for extracurricular and academic activities, which can result in lower academic achievement and graduation rates. On the other hand, education can lessen current social and structural inequalities by giving people the information, competencies, and opportunities for social and economic advancement that they need to function in society. By equipping people with the critical thinking abilities needed to question preexisting power dynamics and work toward social justice, education can also aid in the promotion of social change. In the development of human, social, and cultural capital, education is also crucial. The knowledge, skills, and aptitudes that people develop through education and training, which can raise their economic productivity and earning potential, are referred to as human capital. The networks and resources that people have access to, which can also raise their economic productivity and earning potential, are referred to as social capital. The knowledge, skills, and aptitudes that people gain through education and training, which can elevate their social and economic status, are referred to as cultural capital. Overall, depending on how education is designed and implemented, it can have both favorable and unfavorable effects on issues of equity. By reproducing existing power dynamics and favoring some students while excluding others, education can maintain social and structural inequalities. On the other hand, by giving people the knowledge, skills, and abilities necessary to function in society and by presenting chances for social and economic advancement, education can also lessen the social and structural inequities that already exist. In the development of human, social, and cultural capital, education is also crucial.
