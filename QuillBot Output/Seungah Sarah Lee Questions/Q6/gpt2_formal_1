Education and schooling can both perpetuate and eliminate existing social and structural inequalities in society, hence having substantial effects on issues of inequality. On the one hand, education can prolong existing social and structural inequalities by duplicating existing power relations and benefiting certain pupils while leaving others behind. Children from low-income households and students of color, for instance, are more likely to attend under-resourced schools with less academic and extracurricular opportunities, which can contribute to lower academic achievement and graduation rates. Alternatively, education can lessen existing social and structural inequalities by equipping individuals with the knowledge, skills, and talents necessary to function in society and by giving possibilities for social and economic growth. Education can also promote social change by equipping individuals with the critical thinking skills necessary to challenge existing power structures and advance social fairness. The growth of personal, social, and cultural capital is also greatly influenced by education. Human capital refers to the information, skills, and abilities acquired by individuals via education and training, which can boost their economic productivity and earning potential. Social capital refers to the networks and resources to which individuals have access, which can boost their economic productivity and earning potential. Cultural capital refers to the information, skills, and abilities that people acquire via education and training, which can elevate their social and economic standing. Education and schooling can have both beneficial and bad effects on issues of inequality, depending on the form and implementation of education. By duplicating existing power relations and providing benefits to certain students while leaving others behind, education can perpetuate preexisting social and structural inequalities. Conversely, education can lessen existing social and structural inequalities by equipping individuals with the knowledge, skills, and talents necessary to function in society and by giving possibilities for social and economic growth. The growth of personal, social, and cultural capital is also greatly influenced by education.
