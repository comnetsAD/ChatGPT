Education and schooling can have a big impact on issues of equity. The design and delivery of education can either perpetuate or reduce existing social and structural imbalances in society. On the one hand, education can exacerbate inequalities by replicating existing social and economic arrangements. Children' socioeconomic position is frequently reflected and reinforced by the education system, with students from low-income families and marginalized communities frequently attending under-resourced schools and encountering challenges to academic progress. This can hinder these students' ability to accumulate human, social, and cultural capital, perpetuating existing gaps and reducing their possibilities for upward mobility. Education, on the other hand, can play an important role in eliminating injustices by equipping individuals with the knowledge, skills, and talents required to operate in society and promoting upward mobility. Human, social, and cultural capital, which are critical resources for personal and societal growth, can be gained through education. Education can be used to promote social and economic equality by providing individuals with access to education and opportunity to amass these resources. It is important to note that access to education is not always equal, and certain groups are more likely to suffer educational challenges such as a lack of resources, discrimination, and bias. This has the potential to exacerbate current socioeconomic disparities and prolong social inequality. As a result, education systems must be designed and delivered in a way that is inclusive, responsive to the needs of diverse populations, and promotes equality and social justice. In conclusion, education and schooling have the potential to both perpetuate and ameliorate existing social and structural injustices in society. The manner in which education is structured and provided has a significant impact on issues of unfairness. Education can promote social and economic equality by providing access to human, social, and cultural capital, but it is equally necessary to acknowledge and address the ways in which it can perpetuate existing inequality.
