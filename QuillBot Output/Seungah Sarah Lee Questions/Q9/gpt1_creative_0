Each person's family and community environment can either help or hinder their chances of succeeding academically. Family and friends can play an important role in a child's academic success by providing encouragement, financial aid, and access to books and other learning resources. However, issues such as poverty, a dearth of quality educational opportunities, and discrimination can also arise from a child's immediate environment. Because they provide aid and resources to families and communities that might not have them otherwise, policies and programs that prioritize parental and community educational engagement can help address issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion. There are ways to help students from low-income families compete more fairly, such as programs that provide financial aid for higher education or provide support and resources to help parents navigate the education system. A more welcoming and equitable school climate can also be fostered through parental and community involvement programs. One way to encourage parents to advocate for their children's education and get involved in the school system is through parent education and training programs. Community-based programs, such as tutoring and mentoring, can also help to close the achievement gap and improve educational outcomes for students from low-income backgrounds. By providing aid and resources to families and communities that might not have them otherwise, and by raising parental and community engagement in education, policies and programs that emphasize parental and community educational engagement can play an important role in addressing issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion.
