A person's ability to access and benefit from education depends greatly on their family and community. Families, particularly parents, have a direct influence on the educational experiences and outcomes of their children. For instance, better academic performance and educational outcomes have been linked to parental involvement in a child's education, such as reading to them at home, checking their homework, and participating in their school. Children's attitudes and expectations toward education are also shaped by their families, who also give them emotional, social, and financial support. The educational outcomes of families and communities, on the other hand, who experience poverty, discrimination, or other forms of marginalization, may be negatively impacted by the lack of resources and opportunities available to support their children's education. By offering families and communities the support and resources they need to become more involved in their children's education, policies and programs that put a strong emphasis on parental and community educational engagement can address issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion. Programs that give parents and families access to information, resources, and training to help them understand the educational system and how to support their children's learning can be among these. After-school programs and adult education programs are two examples of community initiatives that can support families and enhance educational outcomes for kids and teenagers. Additionally, parental and community engagement-focused policies and programs can support the removal of barriers and the development of inclusive and equitable learning environments. To achieve this, it is possible to involve communities and families in decision-making processes and to provide them with opportunities to offer feedback and input on educational policies and programs. It can help to create more equitable and inclusive educational opportunities for all students by involving families and communities in the educational system and giving them the tools and support they need to succeed.
