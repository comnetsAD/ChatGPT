Family and community play a significant role in expanding or restricting an individual's educational access and outcomes. Families, particularly parents, have a direct impact on the educational experiences and outcomes of their children. For instance, parental involvement in a child's education, such as reading to them at home, supervising their homework, and volunteering at their school, has been associated with improved academic performance and educational outcomes. In addition to shaping children's attitudes and expectations regarding education, families also provide emotional, social, and financial support. In contrast, families and communities experiencing poverty, discrimination, or other forms of marginalization may have limited resources and opportunities to support their children's education, which can have a negative impact on their educational outcomes. By providing families and communities with support and resources to become more involved in their children's education, policies and programs that emphasize parental and community educational engagement can address issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion. These can include programs that provide parents and families with access to information, resources, and training to better understand the education system and how to support their children's learning. Community programs that support families, such as after-school and adult education programs, can also contribute to improved educational outcomes for children and adolescents. In addition, policies and programs that emphasize parental and community engagement can assist in the elimination of barriers and the creation of more inclusive and equitable educational environments. This can be accomplished by involving families and communities in decision-making processes and providing them with opportunities to offer feedback and input on educational policies and programs. By involving families and communities in the education system and providing them with the resources and support they need to succeed, it is possible to create educational opportunities that are more equitable and inclusive for all students.
