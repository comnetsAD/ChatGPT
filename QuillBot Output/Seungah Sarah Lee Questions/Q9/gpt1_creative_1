Each person's family and neighborhood environment can either help or hinder their chances of succeeding academically. Family and friends can play an important role in a child's academic success by providing encouragement, financial aid, and access to books and other learning resources. However, issues such as poverty, a dearth of excellent educational opportunities, and discrimination can also arise from a child's immediate environment. Because they provide aid and resources to families and communities who might not have them otherwise, policies and initiatives that prioritize parental and community educational participation can assist address issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion. There are ways to help children from low-income households compete more fairly, such as programs that provide financial aid for higher education or provide support and tools to help parents negotiate the school system. A more welcoming and fair school climate can also be fostered through parental and community involvement activities. One way to encourage parents to advocate for their children's education and get active in the school system is through parent education and training programs. Community-based activities, such as tutoring and mentorship, can also help to bridge the achievement gap and improve educational outcomes for students from low-income backgrounds. By providing aid and resources to families and communities that might not have them otherwise, and by raising parental and community engagement in education, policies and programs that emphasize parental and community educational engagement can play an important role in addressing issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion.
