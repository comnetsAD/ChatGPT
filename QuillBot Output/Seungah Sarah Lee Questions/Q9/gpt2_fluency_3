Individuals' educational access and results are greatly influenced by their family and community. Families, particularly parents, have a direct influence on the educational experiences and results of their children. Parental participation in a child's education, for example, reading to them at home, checking their homework, and participating in their school, has been associated to improved academic performance and educational outcomes. Families also impact children's attitudes and expectations toward school, as well as give emotional, social, and financial support. Families and communities experiencing poverty, prejudice, or other types of marginalization, on the other hand, may have limited resources and chances to support their children's education, which may have a detrimental impact on their educational attainment. Policies and initiatives that promote parental and community educational involvement may help to address problems of fairness, diversity, and inclusion by assisting families and communities in becoming more active in their children's education. These may include programs that give parents and families with information, tools, and training to help them better understand the education system and how to assist their children's development. After-school activities and adult education programs in the community may also serve to enhance educational results for children and adolescents. Furthermore, policies and initiatives that emphasize parental and community involvement may aid in the removal of obstacles and the creation of more inclusive and equitable educational settings. This may be accomplished through integrating families and communities in decision-making processes and providing chances for feedback and input on educational policies and initiatives. It is possible to provide more equitable and inclusive educational opportunities for all kids by integrating families and communities in the education system and providing them with the resources and assistance they need.
