Each person's family and neighborhood environment may either help or hinder their chances of succeeding academically. The educational experiences and results of children are profoundly impacted by the family unit, and particularly by the parents. Parental participation in their children's education, such as reading to them at home, keeping an eye on their homework, and volunteering at school, has been associated to improved academic performance and results. In addition to providing emotional, social, and financial support, families also have a significant role in shaping their children's perspectives and expectations of their own educational experiences. Conversely, families and communities who face poverty, prejudice, or other types of marginalization may have less resources and fewer chances to support their children's education, which may have a detrimental impact on the children's academic performance. By encouraging and equipping families and communities to take an active role in their children's schools, policies and initiatives that prioritize parental and community educational involvement may contribute to greater fairness, diversity, and inclusion. Programs like this may help parents and families learn more about the schooling process and develop the skills they need to assist their children's education. The educational results of children and teens may be improved by the implementation of community initiatives that provide assistance to families, such as after-school and adult education programs. Barriers may be reduced and educational opportunities for all students can be improved via the implementation of policies and programs that encourage and support participation by parents and members of the wider community. To do this, it is important to provide families and communities a voice in educational policy and program development. It may assist to promote more equal and inclusive educational opportunities for all kids by including families and communities in the education system and giving the resources and support they need to be successful.
