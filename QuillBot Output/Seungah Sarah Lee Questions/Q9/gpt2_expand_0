Both the individual's access to educational opportunities and the outcomes of those opportunities are significantly influenced by the family and the community. The educational experiences and outcomes of children are directly influenced by their families, and especially by the parents of those children. For instance, there is a correlation between parental involvement in a child's education, such as reading to them at home, supervising their homework, and being involved in their school, and improved academic performance and educational outcomes. Additionally, families are responsible for molding children's perspectives and expectations regarding their educational experiences, in addition to providing the child with emotional, social, and financial support. On the other hand, families and communities that are subjected to poverty, discrimination, or other forms of marginalization may have limited resources and opportunities to support the education of their children, which may have a negative impact on the educational outcomes of those children. By supplying families and communities with the support and resources they need to become more involved in the education of their children, policies and programs that place an emphasis on parental and community educational engagement have the potential to address issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion. Programs that give parents and families access to information, resources, and training that helps them better understand the education system and how to support their children's learning are examples of the types of initiatives that fall under this category. After-school and adult education programs are two examples of community-based initiatives that can help strengthen families and improve educational outcomes for children and young people. In addition, educational policies and programs that put an emphasis on the involvement of parents and the community can contribute to the elimination of barriers and the development of educational settings that are more inclusive and equitable. This can be accomplished by involving families and communities in decision-making processes and creating opportunities for them to provide feedback and input on educational policies and programs. Another way to accomplish this goal is by encouraging students to share their perspectives and ideas with their teachers. It is possible to help create educational opportunities that are more equitable and inclusive for all students if families and communities are actively involved in the education system and are given the resources and support they require to be successful.
