Family and community play a crucial effect in increasing or restricting an individual's educational access and outcomes. Families, particularly parents, have a direct impact on the educational experiences and outcomes of their children. For instance, parental involvement in a child's education, such as reading to them at home, supervising their homework, and volunteering at their school, has been associated with improved academic performance and educational outcomes. In addition to shaping children's views and expectations regarding schooling, families also provide emotional, social, and financial support. In contrast, families and communities experiencing poverty, prejudice, or other forms of marginalization may have limited resources and chances to support their children's education, which can have a detrimental impact on their educational outcomes. By providing families and communities with support and resources to become more involved in their children's education, policies and initiatives that emphasize parental and community educational engagement can address issues of equality, diversity, and inclusion. These can include initiatives that provide parents and families with access to information, resources, and training to better understand the education system and how to assist their children's development. Community activities that support families, such as after-school and adult education programs, can also contribute to improved educational outcomes for children and adolescents. In addition, policies and initiatives that emphasize parental and community engagement can assist in the elimination of barriers and the creation of more inclusive and equitable educational settings. This can be accomplished through integrating families and communities in decision-making processes and providing them with chances to offer feedback and input on educational policies and initiatives. By integrating families and communities in the education system and providing them with the resources and support they need to succeed, it is possible to establish educational opportunities that are more equal and inclusive for all kids.
