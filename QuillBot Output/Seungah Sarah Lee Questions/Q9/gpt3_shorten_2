Family and community greatly affect educational access and success. Families—especially parents—influence their children's education. Parental participation in a child's education, such as reading to them, checking homework, and being active in school, has been associated to higher academic performance and results. Families impact children's schooling expectations and give emotional, social, and financial support. However, families and communities that endure poverty, prejudice, or other marginalization may have inadequate resources and chances to support their children's education, which can severely impact their educational attainment. Parental and community educational involvement policies and initiatives can address fairness, diversity, and inclusion by supporting families and communities in their children's education. These can include programs that give parents and families with information, tools, and training to comprehend the school system and support their children's development. After-school and adult education programs that support families can enhance educational results for children and teens. Parental and community participation policies and initiatives may also reduce barriers and build more inclusive and equitable educational settings. Involve families and communities in decision-making and give them a chance to weigh in on educational policies and activities. Involving families and communities in education and giving them the tools and assistance they need can help promote more fair and inclusive educational opportunities for all kids.
