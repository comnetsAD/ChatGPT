A person's ability to receive and benefit from education depends greatly on their family and society. Families, particularly parents, have a direct influence on the educational experiences and results of their children. For instance, improved academic performance and educational outcomes have been related to parental participation in a child's education, such as reading to them at home, checking their homework, and participating in their school. Children's attitudes and expectations toward school are also shaped by their families, who also provide them emotional, social, and financial support. The educational results of families and communities, on the other hand, who endure poverty, prejudice, or other types of marginalization, may be badly impacted by the lack of resources and opportunity available to support their children's education. By offering families and communities the assistance and resources they need to become more active in their children's education, policies and programs that put a strong emphasis on parental and community educational engagement may address problems of equality, diversity, and inclusion. Programs that provide parents and families access to information, resources, and training to help them understand the educational system and how to assist their children's development might be among these. After-school programs and adult education programs are two examples of community initiatives that may assist families and enhance educational results for kids and teenagers. Additionally, parental and community engagement-focused policies and initiatives may support the removal of obstacles and the development of inclusive and equitable learning environments. To achieve this, it is possible to include communities and families in decision-making processes and to give them with chances to provide feedback and input on educational policies and initiatives. It may assist to promote more equal and inclusive educational opportunities for all children by integrating families and communities in the educational system and giving them the tools and support they need to succeed.
