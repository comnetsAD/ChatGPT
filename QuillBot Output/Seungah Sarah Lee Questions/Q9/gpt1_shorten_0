Family and community greatly affect educational access and outcomes. Family and community can help a child succeed in school by providing books, educational materials, encouragement, and college funding. Poverty, poor schools, and discrimination can also hinder a child's education. Parental and community educational engagement programs can help address equity, diversity, and inclusion by providing support and resources to families and communities that may not otherwise have them. Low-income students can benefit from college financial aid and parent support programs. Parental and community engagement programs can also improve educational equity. Parent education and training programs can empower parents to advocate for their children's education and become more involved in the education system. Community-based programs like tutoring and mentoring can also help disadvantaged students close the achievement gap by providing additional support and resources. In conclusion, policies and programs that promote parental and community educational engagement can help address equity, diversity, and inclusion by supporting and engaging families and communities that may not otherwise have access to them.
