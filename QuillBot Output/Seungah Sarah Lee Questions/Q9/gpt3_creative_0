Each person's family and community environment can either help or hinder their chances of succeeding academically. The educational experiences and outcomes of children are profoundly impacted by the family unit, and especially by the parents. Parental involvement in their children's education, such as reading to them at home, keeping an eye on their homework, and volunteering at school, has been linked to improved academic performance and outcomes. In addition to providing emotional, social, and financial support, families also play a significant role in shaping their children's perspectives and expectations of their own educational experiences. Conversely, families and communities that face poverty, discrimination, or other forms of marginalization may have fewer resources and fewer opportunities to support their children's education, which can have a negative impact on the children's academic performance. By encouraging and equipping families and communities to take an active role in their children's schools, policies and programs that prioritize parental and community educational engagement can contribute to greater equity, diversity, and inclusion. Programs like these can help parents and families learn more about the schooling process and develop the skills they need to assist their children's education. The educational outcomes of children and youth can be improved through the implementation of community programs that provide support to families, such as after-school and adult education programs. Barriers can be reduced and educational opportunities for all students can be improved through the implementation of policies and programs that encourage and support participation by parents and members of the wider community. To accomplish this, it is important to give families and communities a voice in educational policy and program development. It can help to create more equitable and inclusive educational opportunities for all students by involving families and communities in the education system and providing the resources and support they need to be successful.
