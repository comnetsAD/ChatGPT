Family and community greatly affect educational access and outcomes. Families—especially parents—influence their children's education. Parental involvement in a child's education, such as reading to them, monitoring homework, and being involved in school, has been linked to better academic performance and outcomes. Families shape children's education expectations and provide emotional, social, and financial support. However, families and communities that experience poverty, discrimination, or other marginalization may have limited resources and opportunities to support their children's education, which can negatively impact their educational outcomes. Parental and community educational engagement policies and programs can address equity, diversity, and inclusion by supporting families and communities in their children's education. These can include programs that provide parents and families with information, resources, and training to understand the education system and support their children's learning. After-school and adult education programs that support families can improve educational outcomes for children and youth. Parental and community engagement policies and programs can also reduce barriers and create more inclusive and equitable educational environments. Involve families and communities in decision-making and give them a chance to weigh in on educational policies and programs. Involving families and communities in education and giving them the resources and support they need can help create more equitable and inclusive educational opportunities for all students.
