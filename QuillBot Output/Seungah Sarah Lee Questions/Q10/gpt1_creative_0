The term "teacher effect" is used to describe the influence that educators have on their students. Effective teachers can have a beneficial effect on student outcomes like test scores, graduation rates, and college enrollment, as has been shown by extensive research. Teachers are crucial to the success of any educational system, but they are not the only factor. Classrooms, textbooks, and technology are all examples of infrastructural resources that must be thought about, as well as the educational system as a whole and the policies that govern it. To ensure that all people have access to an education of "inclusive and equitable quality" (SDG 4), we must eliminate barriers to learning such as poverty, discrimination, and a lack of financial resources. Access to early childhood education, teaching in multiple languages, and accommodating students with special needs are all strategies that can bolster inclusive education. To ensure that all students have access to the resources and support they need to succeed in school, policies and programs that address poverty, such as school feeding programs and cash transfers, can be implemented. Therefore, improving the quality of education requires a number of interrelated measures, only one of which is an increase in the supply of qualified teachers. If we are to realize the vision of quality education that is accessible to all, regardless of background or financial situation, this initiative must be paired with others that aim to strengthen the educational system as a whole and combat structural inequalities.
