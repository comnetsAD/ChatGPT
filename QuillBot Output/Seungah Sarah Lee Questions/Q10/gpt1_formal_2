The "teacher effect" refers to the influence instructors have on the learning and development of their students. Research has demonstrated that teacher quality is one of the most significant determinants of student accomplishment, and that competent instructors may have a beneficial impact on student outcomes such as test scores, graduation rates, and college enrollment. The availability and quality of resources and infrastructure, such as classrooms, textbooks, and technology, as well as the educational system and regulations in place, are other crucial factors. In addition, achieving "inclusive and equitable quality education" (SDG 4) necessitates tackling structural inequalities such as poverty, discrimination, and lack of access to school, which can limit educational opportunities and achievements for disadvantaged groups. In addition, anti-poverty policies and initiatives, such as school meal programs and cash transfers, may help guarantee that all pupils have the resources and assistance they need to thrive in school. Increasing the number of trained teachers is crucial to enhancing the quality of education, but it is not adequate in and of itself.
