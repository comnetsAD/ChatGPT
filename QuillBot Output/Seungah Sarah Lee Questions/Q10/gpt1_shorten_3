The "teacher effect" is how instructors affect student learning and growth. Effective instructors may improve test scores, graduation rates, and college enrollment, according to research. Teachers are crucial to great education, but they are not the sole determinant. Classrooms, textbooks, technology, the educational system, and regulations are all crucial. "Inclusive and equitable quality education" (SDG 4) also demands tackling structural inequities including poverty, prejudice, and lack of education, which may restrict educational opportunities and results for vulnerable groups. Early childhood education, multilingual education, and special education may assist inclusive education. Poverty-reduction measures like school food and monetary transfers may also assist all pupils thrive in school. Thus, boosting education quality requires more than just adding skilled instructors. To achieve inclusive and equitable quality education for everyone, it must be supplemented by initiatives to enhance the education system and address structural inequities.
