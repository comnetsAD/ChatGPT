Target 4.C of the Sustainable Development Goals recognizes that increasing the supply of qualified teachers is a critical component in realizing the goals of achieving inclusive and equitable quality education. The term "teacher effect" refers to the influence that teachers have on the educational experiences and accomplishments of their students. According to the findings of a body of research, the presence of a good educator can have a material bearing on the academic success and future prospects of their students. However, despite the fact that teachers are a necessary component of providing quality education, it is possible that they are not sufficient on their own to achieve inclusive and equitable quality education. In order to guarantee that all students have access to an inclusive and equitable education, there are a number of other considerations that must be taken into account, including access to resources, school infrastructure, and community involvement. In addition, it is essential to emphasize the fact that merely employing qualified educators is not a sufficient condition for ensuring that the education delivered is both inclusive and equitable. A teacher may have the necessary credentials, but if they do not receive adequate training and support, they run the risk of perpetuating biases and discrimination in the classroom, which will have a negative impact on the education of students from marginalized groups. Therefore, it is essential to place an emphasis on the training and development of teachers that addresses issues of equity, diversity, and inclusion, and to make certain that educators are provided with the knowledge, skills, and practices necessary to deliver education that is inclusive and equitable. To summarize, increasing the supply of qualified teachers is necessary for providing quality education, but this alone is not enough to guarantee that all students will receive an education that is both inclusive and equitable. Additional efforts need to be made to ensure that all students have access to the resources and support they require to be successful in their academic endeavors, as well as to address the structural inequalities that exist in the educational system.
