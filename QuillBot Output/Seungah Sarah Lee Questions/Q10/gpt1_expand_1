The influence that teachers have on their students' intellectual growth and overall development is referred to as the "teacher effect." Research has indicated that one of the most important determinants in student accomplishment is the quality of the teachers, and that good teachers can have a beneficial impact on student outcomes including test scores, graduation rates, and college enrollment rates. Nevertheless, despite the fact that instructors are absolutely necessary to the delivery of a high-quality education, they are not the sole determinant. The entire educational system and the regulations that are in place are other key factors to take into consideration. Other important factors to take into account include the availability and quality of resources and infrastructure, such as classrooms, textbooks, and technology. In addition, in order to meet the requirements of Sustainable Development Goal 4, "inclusive and equitable quality education," it is necessary to address structural inequalities, such as poverty, discrimination, and a lack of access to education. These factors can restrict educational opportunities and outcomes for marginalized groups. For instance, supporting inclusive education can be accomplished through giving access to early childhood education, providing instruction in numerous languages, and providing services for special education students. Additionally, policies and programs that address poverty, such as school food programs and cash transfer programs, can also assist guarantee that all students have access to the resources and support they require in order to be successful in school. Therefore, increasing the number of skilled instructors is a necessary step toward enhancing the overall quality of education; but, this step alone is insufficient to achieve this goal. In order to accomplish the goal of providing an inclusive and equitable quality education to everyone, this initiative needs to be supplemented by additional efforts to enhance the education system as a whole and to address structural inequities.
