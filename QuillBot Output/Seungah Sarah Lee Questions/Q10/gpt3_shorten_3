SDG Target 4.C emphasizes the need for more competent teachers in developing nations to provide excellent education. The teacher influence affects student learning and academic success. Studies demonstrate that teacher quality is one of the most critical elements determining student results. Teachers are essential to great education, but they are not the sole determinant. "Inclusive and equitable quality education" (SDG 4) requires additional variables. Examples: Well-equipped facilities Education for everyone, including impoverished groups Culture-responsive and inclusive curriculum school culture Adequate education funding Good management Thus, although skilled teachers are crucial for quality education, other systemic and structural elements that might impede or promote inclusive and equitable quality education must also be addressed. Poverty, prejudice, and infrastructural and resource shortages may be addressed.
