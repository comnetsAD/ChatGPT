The "teacher effect" refers to teachers' influence on student learning and development. According to research, one of the most important factors in student achievement is teacher quality, and effective teachers can have a positive impact on student outcomes such as test scores, graduation rates, and college enrollment. While teachers are an important part of providing quality education, they are not the only factor. Other critical factors to consider are the availability and quality of resources and infrastructure, such as classrooms, textbooks, and technology, as well as the overall educational system and policies in place. Furthermore, providing "inclusive and equitable quality education" (SDG 4) necessitates addressing structural inequalities that can limit educational opportunities and outcomes for marginalized groups, such as poverty, discrimination, and lack of access to education. Access to early childhood education, education in multiple languages, and special education services, for example, can all contribute to inclusive education. Furthermore, poverty-reduction policies and programs, such as school feeding programs and cash transfers, can help ensure that all students have the resources and support they need to succeed in school. As a result, while increasing the supply of qualified teachers is an important component of improving educational quality, it is not sufficient on its own. To achieve the goal of inclusive and equitable quality education for all, it must be supplemented by other efforts to improve the overall education system and address structural inequalities.
