Target 4.C of the Sustainable Development Goals emphasizes the need of boosting the availability of skilled teachers for delivering excellent education, particularly in developing nations. The teacher effect refers to the influence that instructors have on the learning and academic accomplishment of their students. Studies have demonstrated that instructors play an essential role in student learning, and that teacher quality is one of the most influential elements influencing student results. However, instructors are not the only thing that contributes to the delivery of an excellent education. To provide "inclusive and equitable quality education" (SDG 4), a variety of other issues must be taken into account. These consist of: Appropriate and well-appointed facilities Education for everyone, including impoverished and marginalized populations Curriculum that is inclusive and sensitive to cultural differences Positive and inclusive school environment Adequate education funding Quality leadership and administration Consequently, while skilled teachers are vital for providing quality education, it is equally important to address other systemic and structural problems that might hinder or promote the provision of inclusive and equitable quality education. This may involve tackling challenges such as poverty, prejudice, and infrastructural and resource deficiencies.
