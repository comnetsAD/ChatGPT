The "teacher effect" is how teachers affect student learning and growth. Effective instructors can improve test scores, graduation rates, and college enrollment, according to research. Teachers are crucial to great education, but they are not the sole determinant. Classrooms, textbooks, technology, the educational system, and policies are also crucial. "Inclusive and equitable quality education" (SDG 4) also demands tackling structural inequities including poverty, prejudice, and lack of education, which can limit educational opportunities and outcomes for vulnerable groups. Early childhood education, multilingual education, and special education can support inclusive education. Poverty-reduction measures like school food and monetary transfers can also assist all pupils succeed in school. Thus, boosting education quality requires more than just adding qualified teachers. To achieve inclusive and equitable quality education for all, it must be supplemented by initiatives to enhance the education system and address structural inequities.
