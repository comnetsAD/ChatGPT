Target 4.C of the Sustainable Development Goals recognizes that increasing the supply of qualified teachers is crucial to achieving inclusive and equitable quality education. The "teacher effect" refers to the influence teachers have on the learning and educational outcomes of their students. According to research, having an effective teacher can have a substantial impact on the academic achievement and long-term success of students. Teachers are essential to providing quality education; however, they may not be sufficient to achieve inclusive and equitable quality education. Other factors, such as access to resources, school infrastructure, and community involvement, play an important role in ensuring that all students have access to an inclusive and equitable education. Additionally, it is important to note that having qualified teachers does not guarantee inclusive and equitable education. A qualified teacher may perpetuate biases and discrimination without proper training and support, negatively affecting the education of marginalized students. Therefore, it is essential to prioritize teacher training and development that addresses equity, diversity, and inclusion, and to equip teachers with the knowledge, skills, and practices necessary to provide an inclusive and equitable education. To ensure inclusive and equitable quality education, it is not sufficient to increase the supply of qualified teachers. Additional efforts are required to address structural inequalities and guarantee that all students have access to the necessary resources and support for success.
