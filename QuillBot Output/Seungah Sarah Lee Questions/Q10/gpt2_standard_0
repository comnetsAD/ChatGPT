In order to achieve inclusive and equitable quality education, SDG Target 4.C emphasizes the significance of increasing the supply of qualified teachers. The influence that teachers have on student learning and educational outcomes is referred to as the "teacher effect." According to research, a student's academic success and long-term success can be significantly impacted by an effective teacher. Teachers play a crucial role in providing high-quality education, but they might not be sufficient on their own to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education. All students should have access to an inclusive and equitable education, which is ensured by other factors like resource availability, school facilities, and community involvement. It's also crucial to remember that just because a teacher is qualified does not mean their instruction will be inclusive and equitable. Despite having the necessary qualifications, a teacher may perpetuate prejudice and discrimination, which would have a negative effect on the education of students from marginalized groups. In order to ensure that teachers are prepared to provide inclusive and equitable education, it is crucial to concentrate on teacher development programs that address equity, diversity, and inclusion. Increasing the number of qualified teachers is crucial for providing high-quality instruction, but it is insufficient to guarantee inclusive and equitable quality education. To address structural injustices and guarantee that all students have access to the tools and support they require for success, more needs to be done.
