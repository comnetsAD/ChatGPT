The importance of expanding the supply of trained teachers as a major aspect in attaining inclusive and equitable quality education is recognized in SDG Target 4.C. The "teacher effect" refers to teachers' influence on student learning and educational outcomes. According to research, having a good teacher has a major impact on students' academic achievement and long-term success. While teachers are an important part of providing quality education, they may not be adequate to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education. Access to resources, school infrastructure, and community engagement are also important aspects in ensuring that all kids have access to an inclusive and equitable education. Additionally, having a competent teacher does not guarantee that the education given is inclusive and egalitarian. A teacher may be qualified, but without sufficient training and support, they may propagate biases and discrimination, negatively impacting underprivileged children' education. As a result, it is critical to prioritize teacher training and development that addresses equity, diversity, and inclusion, and to ensure that teachers have the knowledge, skills, and practices necessary to provide inclusive and equitable education. To summarize, while increasing the supply of trained teachers is crucial for providing excellent education, it is insufficient to achieve inclusive and equal quality education. More efforts are needed to address structural disparities and ensure that all students have access to the resources and assistance they require to succeed.
