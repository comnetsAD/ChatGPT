SDG Target 4.C emphasizes the need for qualified teachers to provide inclusive and equitable quality education. The "teacher effect" is how teachers affect student learning and outcomes. Effective teachers improve academic performance and long-term success, according to research. Teachers are essential to quality education, but they may not be enough to ensure inclusive and equitable education. Access to resources, school infrastructure, and community engagement also help ensure inclusive and equitable education for all students. Qualified teachers don't guarantee inclusive and equitable education. Without proper training and support, a qualified teacher may perpetuate biases and discrimination, hurting marginalized students' education. Thus, teacher training and development should address equity, diversity, and inclusion and equip teachers with the knowledge, skills, and practices to provide inclusive and equitable education. In conclusion, increasing the supply of qualified teachers is important for quality education, but it is not enough for inclusive and equitable quality education. Addressing structural inequalities and ensuring all students have the resources and support they need requires more effort.
