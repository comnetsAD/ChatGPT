The influence that teachers have on the growth and learning of their students is known as the "teacher effect." According to research, one of the key determinants of student accomplishment is teacher quality, and good teachers can have a favorable effect on a variety of student outcomes, including test scores, graduation rates, and college enrollment. Along with the general educational system and rules in existence, there are other crucial factors to take into account. These include the accessibility and quality of resources and infrastructure, such as classrooms, textbooks, and technology. Additionally, delivering "inclusive and equitable quality education" (SDG 4) calls for addressing structural inequalities like poverty, discrimination, and lack of access to education that can restrict educational opportunities and outcomes for marginalized groups. These issues can also negatively affect the educational outcomes of these groups. All students can benefit from the resources and assistance they need to succeed in school if policies and programs that combat poverty, such as cash transfers and school food programs, are in place. As a result, while increasing the number of educated instructors is a crucial part of raising educational quality, it is insufficient by itself.
