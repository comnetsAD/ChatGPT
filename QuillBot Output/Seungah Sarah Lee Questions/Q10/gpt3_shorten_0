SDG Target 4.C emphasizes the need for more qualified teachers in developing nations to provide quality education. The teacher effect affects student learning and academic success. Studies show that teacher quality is one of the most important factors affecting student outcomes. Teachers are essential to quality education, but they are not the only factor. "Inclusive and equitable quality education" (SDG 4) requires other factors. Examples: Well-equipped facilities Education for everyone, including disadvantaged groups Culture-responsive and inclusive curriculum school culture Adequate education funding Good management Thus, while qualified teachers are essential for quality education, other systemic and structural factors that can hinder or support inclusive and equitable quality education must also be addressed. Poverty, discrimination, and infrastructure and resource shortages may be addressed.
