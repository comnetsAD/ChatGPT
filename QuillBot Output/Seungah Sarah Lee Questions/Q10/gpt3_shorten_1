SDG Target 4.C emphasizes the need for more competent teachers in developing nations to provide quality education. The teacher influence affects student learning and academic success. Studies demonstrate that teacher quality is one of the most critical elements determining student results. Teachers are essential to quality education, but they are not the sole determinant. "Inclusive and equitable quality education" (SDG 4) requires other variables. Examples: Well-equipped facilities Education for everyone, including disadvantaged groups Culture-responsive and inclusive curriculum school culture Adequate education funding Good management Thus, while qualified teachers are crucial for quality education, other systemic and structural elements that can hinder or support inclusive and equitable quality education must also be addressed. Poverty, discrimination, and infrastructure and resource shortages may be addressed.
