Target 4.C of the Sustainable Development Goals recognizes that expanding the supply of trained teachers is crucial to attaining inclusive and equitable quality education. The "teacher effect" refers to the influence teachers have on the learning and educational outcomes of their students. According to research, having an excellent teacher can have a substantial impact on the academic accomplishment and long-term success of students. Teachers are necessary to providing great education; but, they may not be sufficient to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education. Other elements, such as access to resources, school infrastructure, and community involvement, play an important part in ensuring that all kids have access to an inclusive and equitable education. Additionally, it is vital to remember that having qualified teachers does not ensure inclusive and fair education. A trained teacher may propagate biases and discrimination without sufficient training and support, significantly affecting the education of vulnerable pupils. Therefore, it is essential to prioritize teacher training and development that addresses equity, diversity, and inclusion, and to equip teachers with the knowledge, skills, and practices necessary to provide an inclusive and equitable education. To provide accessible and equitable quality education, it is not sufficient to increase the quantity of competent instructors. Additional efforts are required to eliminate structural inequities and guarantee that all students have access to the necessary resources and support for success.
