Target 4.C of the Sustainable Development Goals emphasizes the significance of expanding the availability of trained educators in order to provide a quality education, particularly in developing countries. The term "teacher effect" refers to the influence that teachers have on the intellectual growth and accomplishments of their students. Studies have demonstrated that teachers play an essential part in the education of their students, and that the quality of the teacher is one of the most critical aspects that determines the outcomes for their students. However, despite the fact that teachers are an essential component, this is not the only aspect that determines the quality of an educational experience. A wide variety of other considerations need to be taken into account in addition to the SDG 4 target of providing "inclusive and equitable quality education." These are the following: Facilities that are both sufficient and in a suitable condition Guaranteed access to education for all, including historically excluded and underserved populations A curriculum that is not exclusive and is sensitive to cultural differences a culture inside the school that is encouraging and welcoming to all enough financial support for educational endeavors Leadership and governance of a high quality Therefore, while qualified teachers are essential for the delivery of quality education, it is also important to address other systemic and structural factors that can either hinder or support the delivery of inclusive and equitable quality education. This is because qualified teachers are essential for the delivery of quality education. This may include tackling challenges such as discrimination, poverty, and a lack of resources and infrastructure.
