The goal of SDG Target 4.C is to ensure that all children have access to a high-quality education, so it makes sense that this goal emphasizes training more teachers. The term "teacher effect" describes the influence that a teacher has on their students. Teachers are crucial to ensuring students receive a great education, but they might not be enough to ensure all students have access to a fair and comprehensive curriculum. Access to resources, school infrastructure, and community involvement all play important roles in providing children with an equal opportunity to learn. It doesn't matter how qualified a teacher is; if they aren't given the resources they need, they may continue to reinforce harmful stereotypes and prejudices, which will have a devastating effect on the learning of their pupils from underrepresented groups. That's why it's crucial to invest in educators' professional growth in ways that promote fairness, diversity, and inclusion so they can provide their students with an education that is really accessible to everyone. All kids should have access to the materials and guidance they need to flourish, but more work has to be done to eliminate systemic disparities.
