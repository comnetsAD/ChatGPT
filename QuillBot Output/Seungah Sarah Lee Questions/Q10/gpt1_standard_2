The influence that instructors have on the growth and learning of their students is known as the "teacher effect." According to research, one of the key determinants of student accomplishment is teacher quality, and good teachers may have a favorable effect on a variety of student outcomes, including test scores, graduation rates, and college enrollment. Teachers have a crucial role in providing high-quality education, but they are not the only one. Along with the general educational system and rules in existence, there are other crucial factors to take into account. These include the accessibility and quality of resources and infrastructure, such as classrooms, textbooks, and technology. Additionally, delivering "inclusive and equitable quality education" (SDG 4) calls for addressing structural inequalities like poverty, discrimination, and lack of access to education that can restrict educational opportunities and outcomes for marginalized groups. These issues can also negatively affect the educational outcomes of these groups. For instance, offering special education services, early childhood education, and education in different languages may assist inclusive education. All kids may benefit from the resources and assistance they need to thrive in school if policies and programs that combat poverty, such as cash transfers and school food programs, are in place. As a result, while increasing the number of educated instructors is a crucial part of raising educational quality, it is insufficient by itself. In order to realize the objective of inclusive and equitable quality education for everyone, it must be accompanied by additional initiatives to enhance the entire educational system and address structural inequities.
