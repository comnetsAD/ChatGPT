The influence that instructors have on their students' intellectual growth and overall development is referred to as the "teacher effect." Research has indicated that one of the most significant determinants in student accomplishment is the quality of the instructors, and that good teachers may have a beneficial influence on student outcomes including test scores, graduation rates, and college enrollment rates. Nevertheless, despite the fact that instructors are very necessary to the delivery of a high-quality education, they are not the sole determinant. The entire educational system and the regulations that are in place are other key factors to take into consideration. Other important factors to take into account include the availability and quality of resources and infrastructure, such as classrooms, textbooks, and technology. In addition, in order to meet the requirements of Sustainable Development Goal 4, "inclusive and equitable quality education," it is necessary to address structural inequalities, such as poverty, discrimination, and a lack of access to education. These factors can restrict educational opportunities and outcomes for marginalized groups. For instance, supporting inclusive education may be accomplished via giving access to early childhood education, offering instruction in numerous languages, and providing assistance for special education students. Additionally, policies and programs that address poverty, such as school food programs and cash transfer programs, may also assist guarantee that all kids have access to the resources and support they need in order to be successful in school. Therefore, increasing the number of skilled instructors is a necessary step toward enhancing the overall quality of education; but, this step alone is insufficient to achieve this goal. In order to accomplish the aim of providing an inclusive and equitable quality education to everyone, this initiative has to be supplemented by additional initiatives to enhance the education system as a whole and to address structural inequities.
