SDG Target 4.C emphasizes the need for skilled teachers to provide inclusive and equitable quality education. The "teacher effect" is how teachers affect student learning and outcomes. Effective teachers improve academic performance and long-term success, according to research. Teachers are crucial to quality education, but they may not be enough to provide inclusive and equal education. Access to resources, school infrastructure, and community participation also help ensure inclusive and equitable education for all kids. Qualified teachers don't ensure inclusive and fair education. Without sufficient training and support, a skilled teacher may perpetuate prejudices and discrimination, hurting minority children' education. Thus, teacher training and development should address equity, diversity, and inclusion and equip teachers with the knowledge, skills, and practices to provide inclusive and equitable education. In conclusion, increasing the number of trained teachers is crucial for quality education, but it is not enough for inclusive and equitable quality education. Addressing structural inequities and ensuring all kids get the resources and assistance they need requires more work.
