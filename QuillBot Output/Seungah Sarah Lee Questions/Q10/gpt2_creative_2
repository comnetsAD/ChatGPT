The goal of SDG Target 4.C is to ensure that all children have access to a high-quality education, therefore it makes sense that this goal emphasizes training more teachers. The term "teacher effect" describes the influence that a teacher has on their students. Having a good teacher may have a profound effect on a student's academic performance and future success, according to studies. Teachers are crucial to ensuring students receive a great education, but they might not be enough to ensure all students have access to a fair and comprehensive curriculum. Access to resources, school infrastructure, and community involvement all play important roles in providing children with an equal opportunity to learn. It's also worth noting that just because a teacher has the proper credentials does not mean that the education they deliver will be accessible to everyone. It doesn't matter how skilled a teacher is; if they aren't given the resources they need, they may continue to reinforce harmful stereotypes and prejudices, which will have a devastating effect on the learning of their pupils from underrepresented groups. That's why it's crucial to invest in educators' professional growth in ways that promote fairness, diversity, and inclusion so they can provide their students with an education that is really accessible to everyone. In conclusion, ensuring that all students receive an education of sufficient quality requires more than simply increasing the number of skilled instructors available. All kids should have access to the materials and guidance they need to flourish, but more work has to be done to eliminate systemic disparities.
