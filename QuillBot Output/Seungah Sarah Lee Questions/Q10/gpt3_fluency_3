SDG Target 4.C emphasizes the significance of boosting the number of trained teachers in order to provide high-quality education, especially in developing countries. The teacher effect is the influence that instructors have on student learning and accomplishment. According to research, instructors have a vital influence in student learning, and teacher quality is one of the most critical elements influencing student results. While instructors are an important part of providing great education, they are not the sole element. A variety of additional issues must be examined in order to provide "inclusive and equitable quality education" (SDG 4). These are some examples: Facilities that are adequate and well-equipped Everyone, especially excluded and underprivileged groups, has equal access to education. Inclusionary and culturally sensitive curriculum School culture that is supportive and welcoming Adequate education funding Excellent leadership and governance As a result, although skilled teachers are critical for providing quality education, it is equally critical to address other systemic and structural variables that might impede or facilitate the provision of inclusive and equitable quality education. Addressing challenges such as poverty, inequality, and a lack of infrastructure and resources may fall under this category.
