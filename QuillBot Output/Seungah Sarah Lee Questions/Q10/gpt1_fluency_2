The "teacher effect" refers to instructors' influence on student learning and growth. According to research, one of the most significant determinants in student accomplishment is teacher quality, and competent instructors may have a favorable impact on student outcomes such as test scores, graduation rates, and college enrollment. While instructors are an important part of providing great education, they are not the sole element. Other critical factors to examine include the availability and quality of resources and infrastructure, such as classrooms, textbooks, and technology, as well as the broader educational system and regulations in place. Furthermore, ensuring "inclusive and equitable quality education" (SDG 4) necessitates tackling structural inequalities that might limit educational opportunities and results for disadvantaged groups, such as poverty, discrimination, and lack of access to education. Access to early childhood education, schooling in various languages, and special education programs, for example, may all contribute to inclusive education. Furthermore, poverty-reduction policies and initiatives, such as school food programs and cash transfers, may assist guarantee that all pupils have the resources and support they need to thrive in school. As a result, while increasing the number of educated instructors is an important component of enhancing educational quality, it is not adequate on its own. To attain the objective of inclusive and equitable quality education for everyone, it must be supplemented by additional measures to strengthen the broader education system and eliminate structural inequities.
