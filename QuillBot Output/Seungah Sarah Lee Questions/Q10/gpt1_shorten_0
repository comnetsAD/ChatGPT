The influence that teachers have on their students' intellectual growth and overall development is referred to as the "teacher effect." Research has shown that one of the most important factors in student achievement is the quality of the teachers, and that effective teachers can have a positive impact on student outcomes like test scores, graduation rates, and college enrollment rates. Nevertheless, despite the fact that teachers are absolutely necessary to the delivery of a high-quality education, they are not the only factor. The overall educational system and the policies that are in place are also important factors to take into consideration. Other important factors to take into account include the availability and quality of resources and infrastructure, such as classrooms, textbooks, and technology. In addition, in order to meet the requirements of Sustainable Development Goal 4, "inclusive and equitable quality education," it is necessary to address structural inequalities, such as poverty, discrimination, and a lack of access to education. These factors can restrict educational opportunities and outcomes for marginalized groups. For instance, supporting inclusive education can be accomplished through providing access to early childhood education, providing education in multiple languages, and providing services for special education students. Additionally, policies and programs that address poverty, such as school feeding programs and cash transfer programs, can also help ensure that all students have access to the resources and support they require in order to be successful in school. Therefore, increasing the supply of qualified teachers is a necessary step toward improving the overall quality of education; however, this step alone is insufficient to achieve this goal. In order to accomplish the goal of providing an inclusive and equitable quality education to everyone, this initiative needs to be supplemented by other efforts to improve the education system as a whole and to address structural inequalities.
