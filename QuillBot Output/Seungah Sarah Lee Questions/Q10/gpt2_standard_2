In order to achieve inclusive and equitable quality education, SDG Target 4.C emphasizes the need of boosting the supply of trained teachers. The influence that instructors have on student learning and educational results is referred to as the "teacher effect." According to research, a student's academic progress and long-term success may be significantly impacted by a good instructor. Teachers play a crucial role in providing high-quality education, but they might not be sufficient on their own to provide inclusive and fair quality education. All children should have access to an inclusive and equitable education, which is ensured by other criteria including resource availability, school facilities, and community involvement. It's also crucial to remember that just because a teacher is certified does not mean their instruction will be inclusive and egalitarian. Despite having the necessary qualifications, a teacher may promote prejudice and discrimination, which would have a negative effect on the education of children from marginalized groups. In order to guarantee that teachers are prepared to provide inclusive and equitable education, it is crucial to concentrate on teacher development programs that target equality, diversity, and inclusion. Increasing the number of trained teachers is crucial for providing high-quality instruction, but it is insufficient to guarantee inclusive and equitable quality education. To address systemic injustices and guarantee that all students have access to the tools and support they require for success, more has to be done.
