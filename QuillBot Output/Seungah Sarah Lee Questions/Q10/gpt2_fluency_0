The importance of increasing the supply of qualified teachers as a key factor in achieving inclusive and equitable quality education is recognized in SDG Target 4.C. The "teacher effect" refers to teachers' influence on student learning and educational outcomes. According to research, having an effective teacher has a significant impact on students' academic achievement and long-term success. While teachers are an important part of providing quality education, they may not be enough to achieve inclusive and equitable quality education. Access to resources, school infrastructure, and community engagement are also important factors in ensuring that all students have access to an inclusive and equitable education. Additionally, having a qualified teacher does not guarantee that the education provided is inclusive and equitable. A teacher may be qualified, but without proper training and support, they may perpetuate biases and discrimination, negatively impacting marginalized students' education. As a result, it is critical to prioritize teacher training and development that addresses equity, diversity, and inclusion, and to ensure that teachers have the knowledge, skills, and practices necessary to provide inclusive and equitable education. To summarize, while increasing the supply of qualified teachers is important for providing quality education, it is insufficient to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education. More efforts are needed to address structural inequalities and ensure that all students have access to the resources and support they require to succeed.
