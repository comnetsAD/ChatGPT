SDG Target 4.C emphasizes the importance of increasing the supply of qualified teachers in order to provide high-quality education, particularly in developing countries. The teacher effect is the influence that teachers have on student learning and achievement. According to research, teachers play an important role in student learning, and teacher quality is one of the most important factors influencing student outcomes. While teachers are an important part of providing quality education, they are not the only factor. A variety of other factors must be considered in order to provide "inclusive and equitable quality education" (SDG 4). These are some examples: Facilities that are adequate and well-equipped Everyone, including marginalized and disadvantaged groups, has equal access to education. Inclusionary and culturally responsive curriculum School culture that is supportive and inclusive Adequate education funding Excellent leadership and governance As a result, while qualified teachers are critical for providing quality education, it is also critical to address other systemic and structural factors that can impede or facilitate the provision of inclusive and equitable quality education. Addressing issues such as poverty, discrimination, and a lack of infrastructure and resources may fall under this category.
