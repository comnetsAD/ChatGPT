The importance of increasing the supply of qualified teachers for providing quality education is highlighted in SDG Target 4.C, which focuses on the needs of developing countries. The term "teacher effect" is used to describe the influence that teachers have on their students' ability to learn and succeed in school. Researchers have found that classroom instructors have a significant impact on their students' academic growth and development. However, while educators are essential to the success of any school, they are not the only factor. While SDG 4 emphasizes providing "quality education for all," this objective cannot be achieved without also taking into account a number of other factors. Among these are: Space that is both sufficient and well-appointed All people, including those from minority or underprivileged groups, should be able to pursue and complete a formal education. An open and sensitive to culture's needs curriculum positive and welcoming school climate Sufficient resources for schools Credible leadership and sound administration In light of this, it is crucial to address not only the shortage of qualified educators but also the presence or absence of other systemic and structural factors that can either hinder or facilitate the provision of inclusive and equitable quality education. Issues like poverty, discrimination, and inadequate infrastructure and resources may need to be addressed.
