SDG Target 4.C emphasizes how crucial it is to increase the pool of qualified teachers in order to provide high-quality instruction, particularly in developing nations. The teacher effect is the influence that teachers have on the academic performance and learning of their students. Studies have shown that teachers are essential to student learning and that one of the most significant factors influencing student outcomes is teacher quality. Teachers play a crucial role in providing high-quality education, but they are not the only one. A variety of other factors must also be taken into account in order to deliver "inclusive and equitable quality education" (SDG 4). These consist of: Suitable and complete facilities Everyone should have access to education, including disadvantaged and marginalized groups. inclusive and culturally sensitive instruction favorable and welcoming school climate enough money for education exemplary governing and leadership As a result, while having qualified teachers is crucial for providing high-quality instruction, it's also critical to address other systemic and structural issues that may either obstruct or facilitate the provision of inclusive and equitable quality instruction. Addressing problems like poverty, discrimination, and a lack of infrastructure and resources may be part of this.
