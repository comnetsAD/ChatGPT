Target 4.C of the Sustainable Development Goals emphasizes the significance of increasing the supply of qualified teachers for delivering quality education, particularly in developing nations. The teacher effect refers to the influence that teachers have on the learning and academic achievement of their students. Studies have demonstrated that teachers play an essential role in student learning, and that teacher quality is one of the most influential factors influencing student outcomes. However, teachers are not the only factor that contributes to the delivery of a quality education. To provide "inclusive and equitable quality education" (SDG 4), a variety of additional factors must be taken into account. These consist of: Appropriate and well-appointed facilities Education for all, including disadvantaged and marginalized groups Curriculum that is inclusive and sensitive to cultural differences Positive and inclusive school environment Adequate education funding Quality leadership and administration Consequently, while qualified teachers are essential for providing quality education, it is also important to address other systemic and structural factors that can hinder or support the provision of inclusive and equitable quality education. This may involve addressing issues such as poverty, discrimination, and infrastructure and resource deficiencies.
