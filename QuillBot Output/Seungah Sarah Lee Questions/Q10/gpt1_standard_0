The "teacher effect" is how teachers affect student learning and development. Effective teachers can improve test scores, graduation rates, and college enrollment, according to research. Teachers are crucial to quality education, but they are not the only factor. Classrooms, textbooks, technology, the educational system, and policies are also important. "Inclusive and equitable quality education" (SDG 4) also requires addressing structural inequalities like poverty, discrimination, and lack of education, which can limit educational opportunities and outcomes for marginalized groups. Early childhood education, multilingual education, and special education can support inclusive education. Poverty-reduction programs like school feeding and cash transfers can also help all students succeed in school. Thus, improving education quality requires more than just adding qualified teachers. To achieve inclusive and equitable quality education for all, it must be supplemented by efforts to improve the education system and address structural inequalities.
