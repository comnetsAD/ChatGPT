The "teacher effect" refers to teachers' influence on student learning and growth. According to research, one of the most important determinants in student accomplishment is teacher quality, and competent instructors can have a favorable impact on student outcomes such as test scores, graduation rates, and college enrollment. While instructors are an important part of providing quality education, they are not the sole factor. Other critical factors to consider are the availability and quality of resources and infrastructure, such as classrooms, textbooks, and technology, as well as the broader educational system and regulations in place. Furthermore, ensuring "inclusive and equitable quality education" (SDG 4) necessitates tackling structural inequalities that might limit educational opportunities and outcomes for marginalized groups, such as poverty, discrimination, and lack of access to education. Access to early childhood education, schooling in various languages, and special education programs, for example, can all contribute to inclusive education. Furthermore, poverty-reduction policies and programs, such as school food programs and cash transfers, can assist ensure that all pupils have the resources and support they need to succeed in school. As a result, while increasing the supply of educated instructors is an important component of enhancing educational quality, it is not adequate on its own. To attain the goal of inclusive and equitable quality education for all, it must be supplemented by additional measures to strengthen the broader education system and eliminate structural inequities.
