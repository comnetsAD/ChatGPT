Based on the short film "Bader," I empathize with the little Qatari kid and his elementary school struggles. The video shows his cultural and linguistic challenges as a non-native English speaker in an English-speaking school. The film also explores cultural identity and Bader's struggle to adapt to his school's westernized ideals while maintaining his native heritage. Classroom, school, and community suggestions may address these issues. Bilingual or ESL teaching may assist children like Bader overcome the language barrier and enhance academic achievements. Cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff may also improve classroom culture. Cultural fairs and guest lecturers may help students appreciate and comprehend diverse cultures. Including various parents and community people in the school community may also make it more inclusive. Language lessons and cultural events for families may help youngsters like Bader keep their ethnic identity at the community level. Addressing structural disparities like prejudice and marginalization may also assist establish a more fair and inclusive society.
