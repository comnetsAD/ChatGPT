My initial reaction to the short film "Bader" is that it emphasizes the difficulties that young children from minority cultures face in a school system that may not fully understand or appreciate their cultural background. Bader, a young Qatari boy, is portrayed in the film as struggling to navigate the cultural differences and expectations between his home and school life. Cultural identity, cultural mismatch, and the role of education in shaping societal norms are among the film's themes. Bader's experience exemplifies the notion that the dominant culture in schools frequently prioritizes Western norms and values, resulting in cultural mismatches for students from minority cultures. To address the issues that boys like Bader face, I would suggest a number of solutions that can be implemented in the classroom, school, and community. Teachers should strive to create a culturally inclusive and responsive classroom environment in the classroom. This can be accomplished by incorporating multicultural education into the curriculum, valuing and celebrating all students' cultural backgrounds, and encouraging cultural understanding and empathy among students. Educators should work to foster a more culturally diverse and inclusive school culture. This can be accomplished by providing cultural competency training to teachers and professional development opportunities that focus on cultural understanding. In addition, the curriculum and school activities should include a wider range of cultures. Schools should collaborate with families and community organizations to promote cultural understanding and appreciation at the community level. This can be accomplished by including families and community organizations in school activities and events, as well as collaborating with them to develop programs and initiatives that promote cultural understanding and appreciation. In general, it is critical to recognize and respect students' cultural identities, as well as to provide support and resources that help bridge the cultural gap between home and school.
