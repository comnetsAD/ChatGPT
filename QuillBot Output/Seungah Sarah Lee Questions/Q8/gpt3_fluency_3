My immediate impression to the short film "Bader" is that it emphasizes the difficulties that young children from minority cultures confront in a school system that may not completely comprehend or respect their cultural heritage. Bader, a young Qatari boy, is shown in the film as having to manage the cultural differences and expectations between his home and school life. Cultural identity, cultural mismatch, and the importance of education in influencing society standards are among the film's themes. Bader's story exemplifies the notion that the prevailing culture in schools often promotes Western standards and values, resulting in cultural mismatches for pupils from minority cultures. To address the issues that boys like Bader confront, I would suggest a number of solutions that may be applied in the classroom, school, and community. Teachers should try to establish a culturally inclusive and responsive teaching environment in the classroom. This may be accomplished through introducing multicultural education into the curriculum, appreciating and honoring all students' cultural origins, and encouraging cultural knowledge and empathy among students. Educators should endeavor to foster a more culturally diverse and inclusive school atmosphere. This may be accomplished by giving cultural competence training to teachers and professional development opportunities that concentrate on cultural awareness. In addition, the curriculum and school activities should include a wider spectrum of cultures. Schools should collaborate with families and community groups to foster cultural awareness and appreciation at the community level. This may be accomplished through including families and community groups in school activities and events, as well as collaborating with them to develop programs and initiatives that enhance cultural awareness and respect. In general, it is critical to recognize and respect kids' cultural identities, as well as to give assistance and resources that help bridge the cultural divide between home and school.
