The short video Bader emphasizes the cultural and language obstacles that the young Qatari kid Bader experiences in elementary school, per my immediate impression. It looks that he is having difficulty navigating the cultural and linguistic contrasts between his home culture and the mostly English-speaking culture of the school. This demonstrates the significance of cultural and language sensitivity and inclusiveness in the educational system. It is probable that the school does not sufficiently address the needs of pupils from non-dominant cultures and languages as a cause for the current state of affairs. This may be due to a lack of resources, training, or comprehension on the side of school administration and employees. Additionally, cultural views and attitudes towards language and culture may contribute to this issue. In order to alleviate the difficulties experienced by boys like Bader, the following suggestions might be adopted at the classroom, school, and community levels: This might involve giving language lessons for non-dominant languages and employing instructors and employees with proficiency in many languages. Cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff: This would guarantee that school personnel are aware of and attentive to the cultural and language requirements of every student. Community involvement and outreach may entail collaborating with community groups and leaders to involve parents and families in the education process, therefore fostering mutual trust and understanding between the school and the community. This might include using inclusive teaching approaches, such as the use of real-world examples and active learning, in order to create a more inclusive learning environment.
