Bader, a Qatari youngster in primary school, confronts cultural and linguistic obstacles. He seems to be having trouble adjusting to the school's English-speaking culture and his home culture. Cultural and linguistic sensitivity and diversity in education are crucial. The school may not be meeting the needs of non-dominant cultural and language kids. School administrators may lack funding, training, or understanding. Societal language and culture views may also contribute to this issue. Some classroom, school, and community solutions for boys like Bader include: Bilingual or multilingual education: This could include teaching non-dominant languages and hiring bilingual teachers and staff. Cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff: This would help school employees understand and respect pupils' cultural and language demands. Community engagement and outreach: Working with community groups and leaders to involve parents and families in education helps establish trust and understanding between the school and the community. Inclusive teaching strategies: Real-world examples and active learning can create a more inclusive learning environment.
