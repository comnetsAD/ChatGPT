Based on the short film "Bader," I initially feel compassion for the little Qatari child and the difficulties he encounters in elementary school. The film focuses on the cultural and linguistic obstacles he faces as a non-native English speaker in an English-dominant school. In addition, the film deals on the topic of cultural identity and the pressure Bader feels to conform to the westernized norms of his educational environment, despite his efforts to keep his cultural heritage. A few proposals could be made at the classroom, school, and community levels to address these difficulties. In the classroom, providing non-native English speakers with additional support, such as bilingual or ESL (English as a Second Language) training, can help to overcome the language barrier and enhance academic achievements for kids like Bader. In addition, including cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff can assist establish a classroom environment that is more inclusive and tolerant. Creating chances for cultural interchange and understanding at the school level, such as cultural fairs or guest lecturers, helps foster a broader awareness and comprehension of diverse cultural origins and experiences. Additionally, actively seeking out and incorporating parents and community members from varied backgrounds can help establish a more inclusive and welcoming school community. At the level of the community, offering resources and assistance for families to keep and build their cultural history and identity, such as language classes or cultural events, can boost the cultural identification of children like Bader. Additionally, addressing and challenging any structural inequalities, such as prejudice or marginalization, that may exist in the community can assist to establish a more equitable and inclusive society for all.
