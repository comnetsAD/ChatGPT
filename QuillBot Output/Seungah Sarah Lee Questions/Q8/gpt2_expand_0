As a result of watching the short film "Bader," my first reaction was one of sympathy for the young Qatari boy and the difficulties he encounters while attending elementary school. The documentary sheds light on the cultural and linguistic obstacles that he faces in a classroom where English is used as the primary language of instruction due to the fact that he is not a native speaker of the language. In addition, the movie touches on the topic of cultural identity, as well as the pressure that Bader feels to conform to the westernized norms of his school environment, while at the same time he is struggling to maintain connection to his own cultural heritage. At the levels of the classroom, the school, and the community, there are a few recommendations that could be taken into consideration in order to address these challenges. Students like Bader who are non-native English speakers can have a better chance of succeeding academically if their teachers offer bilingual or ESL (English as a Second Language) instruction in the classroom. This can help to overcome the language barrier that exists between the two groups of students and improve academic outcomes. In addition, providing educators and support staff with cultural sensitivity training can assist in the development of classroom environments that are more accepting and understanding of diverse perspectives. At the level of the school, the promotion of greater appreciation and understanding of different cultural backgrounds and experiences can be facilitated by the creation of opportunities for cultural exchange and comprehension, such as cultural fairs or speakers from other cultures. Furthermore, actively seeking out and involving community members and parents of the school community who come from a variety of backgrounds can help contribute to the development of an environment that is more inclusive and welcoming. Children who have a cultural identity like Bader's can have that identity supported on a community level by the provision of resources and support for families to help them preserve and strengthen their cultural heritage and identity. These resources and supports can take the form of cultural activities or language classes. In addition, working to address and challenge any structural inequalities that may exist in the community, such as discrimination or marginalization, can help to contribute to the creation of a society that is more equitable and welcoming for everyone.
