My initial response, based on the short video "Bader," is one of sympathy for the little Qatari child and the difficulties he encounters in his elementary school. He encounters linguistic and cultural hurdles as a non-native English speaker in a school where English is the main language of teaching, which are highlighted in the movie. The movie also addresses the issue of cultural identity, namely the strain Bader faces to fit in with the westernized standards of his educational environment while still trying to stay connected to his own cultural roots. There are a few suggestions that might be taken into account at the classroom, school, and community levels to solve these issues. In the classroom, giving non-native English speakers additional support in the form of bilingual or ESL (English as a Second Language) training can help students like Bader overcome the language barrier and achieve better academic results. Incorporating cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff can also contribute to the development of a more accepting and understanding learning environment. A greater appreciation and understanding of various cultural backgrounds and experiences can be encouraged at the school level by providing opportunities for cultural interchange and understanding, such as cultural fairs or guest lecturers. A more inclusive and inviting environment can also be produced by actively seeking out and involving parents and community members from various backgrounds. The cultural identification of kids like Bader can be supported at the community level by offering resources and assistance to families so they can preserve and strengthen their cultural history and identity, such as language classes or cultural events. A more equitable and inclusive society can be developed for all by striving to address and fight any structural disparities that may exist in the community, such as marginalization or prejudice.
