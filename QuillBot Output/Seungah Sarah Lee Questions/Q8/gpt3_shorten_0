The short film "Bader" shows the challenges minority children face in a school system that may not understand or appreciate their culture. Bader, a young Qatari boy, struggles to balance home and school culture in the film. The film explores cultural identity, mismatch, and education's influence on society. Bader's experience shows that schools' dominant culture often values Western norms and values, which can alienate minority students. I suggest classroom, school, and community solutions for boys like Bader. Teachers should create a multicultural classroom. Multicultural education, celebrating all students' cultures, and fostering cultural understanding and empathy can achieve this. Schools should promote cultural diversity and inclusion. Cultural competency training for teachers and cultural understanding professional development can achieve this. The curriculum and activities should also include more cultures. Schools should promote cultural understanding and appreciation with families and community organizations. Families and community organizations can be involved in school activities and events to create cultural understanding and appreciation programs. It's important to respect students' cultural identities and provide support and resources to bridge the cultural gap between home and school.
