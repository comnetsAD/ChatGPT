My immediate impression to the short video "Bader" is that it emphasizes the difficulties young children from minority cultures experience in a school system that may not completely comprehend or value their cultural heritage. Bader, a young Qatari boy, struggles to negotiate the cultural differences and expectations between his home and school life in the film. Cultural identity, cultural mismatch, and the function of education in influencing society standards are themes of the film. Bader's story illustrates the notion that the prevailing culture in schools often promotes Western standards and values, which may cause a cultural mismatch for minority pupils. To address the difficulties faced by boys like Bader, I would offer a number of classroom, school, and community-level interventions. Teachers should aim to establish a classroom climate that is culturally inclusive and responsive. This may be accomplished through introducing multicultural education into the curriculum, appreciating and honoring the cultural backgrounds of all pupils, and encouraging cultural awareness and empathy among students. Educators should endeavor to establish a school atmosphere that is more culturally diverse and inclusive. This may be accomplished by offering professional development opportunities that emphasize cultural knowledge and educating instructors in cultural competence. The school should also include a wider variety of cultures into its curriculum and extracurricular activities. Schools should collaborate with families and community groups to foster cultural awareness and appreciation at the community level. This may be accomplished by including families and community groups in school activities and events and by collaborating with them to develop programs and initiatives that foster cultural respect and understanding. In general, it is crucial to recognize and respect the cultural identity of kids and to give assistance and tools that help bridge the cultural divide between home and school.
