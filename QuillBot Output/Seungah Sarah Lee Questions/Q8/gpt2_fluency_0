My initial reaction to the short film "Bader" is one of empathy for the young Qatari boy and the challenges he faces in elementary school. The documentary focuses on the cultural and linguistic barriers he faces as a non-native English speaker in a classroom where English is the primary language of instruction. Furthermore, the film explores the theme of cultural identity, specifically the pressure Bader feels to conform to the westernized norms of his school environment while struggling to maintain a connection to his own cultural heritage. There are a few recommendations that could be considered at the classroom, school, and community levels to address these challenges. Providing additional support for non-native English speakers in the classroom, such as bilingual or ESL (English as a Second Language) instruction, can help to bridge the language barrier and improve academic outcomes for students like Bader. Including cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff can also contribute to a more inclusive and understanding classroom environment. Cultural exchange and understanding opportunities, such as cultural fairs or guest speakers, can promote a greater appreciation and understanding of different cultural backgrounds and experiences at the school level. Furthermore, actively seeking out and involving parents and community members from various backgrounds in the school community can aid in the creation of a more inclusive and welcoming environment. Community resources and support for families to maintain and strengthen their cultural heritage and identity, such as language classes or cultural activities, can help to support children like Bader's cultural identity. Working to address and challenge any structural inequalities that may exist in the community, such as discrimination or marginalization, can also contribute to the creation of a more equitable and inclusive society for all.
