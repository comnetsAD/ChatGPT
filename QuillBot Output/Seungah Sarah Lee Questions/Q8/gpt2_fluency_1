My initial reaction to the short video "Bader" is one of empathy for the little Qatari child and the obstacles he experiences in elementary school. The documentary focuses on the cultural and linguistic challenges he faces as a non-native English speaker in a classroom where English is the predominant language of instruction. Furthermore, the film explores the issue of cultural identity, namely the pressure Bader feels to adapt to the westernized norms of his educational setting while striving to maintain a connection to his own cultural history. There are a few proposals that could be addressed at the classroom, school, and community levels to address these difficulties. Providing additional support for non-native English speakers in the classroom, such as bilingual or ESL (English as a Second Language) instruction, can help to bridge the language barrier and enhance academic achievement for kids like Bader. Including cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff can also contribute to a more inclusive and understanding classroom atmosphere. Cultural exchange and understanding opportunities, such as cultural fairs or guest lecturers, can promote a broader awareness and understanding of other cultural origins and experiences at the school level. Furthermore, actively seeking out and incorporating parents and community members from various backgrounds in the school community can aid in the creation of a more inclusive and welcoming environment. Community services and support for families to keep and build their cultural history and identity, such as language classes or cultural events, can help to support youngsters like Bader's cultural identification. Working to address and fight any structural inequalities that may exist in the community, such as prejudice or marginalization, can also contribute to the creation of a more equitable and inclusive society for all.
