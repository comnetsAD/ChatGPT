My first impression after viewing the short video Bader is that it emphasizes the cultural and language obstacles that the young Qatari kid, Bader, experiences at his primary school. He looks to be having difficulty navigating the cultural and linguistic gaps between his home culture and the prevailing culture of the school, which is mostly English-speaking. This emphasizes the significance of cultural and language sensitivity and diversity in education. In terms of why things are the way they are, it is conceivable that the school is not meeting the needs of kids from non-dominant cultures and languages sufficiently. This might be due to a lack of resources, training, or comprehension on the side of teachers and administrators. Furthermore, social attitudes and views regarding language and culture may contribute to this issue. Some solutions that might be taken at the classroom, school, and community levels to alleviate the issues experienced by boys like Bader include: Bilingual or multilingual education: This might include non-dominant language language programs, as well as recruiting instructors and personnel that are fluent in various languages. Cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff: This would assist guarantee that school personnel are aware of and attentive to all pupils' cultural and language requirements. Community involvement and outreach may include collaborating with community groups and leaders to involve parents and families in the educational process, which may aid in the development of trust and understanding between the school and the community. Inclusive teaching strategies: To create a more inclusive learning environment, employ inclusive teaching approaches such as the utilization of real-world examples and active learning.
