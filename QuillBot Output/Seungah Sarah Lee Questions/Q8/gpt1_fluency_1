My first impression after watching the short video Bader is that it emphasizes the cultural and language obstacles that the young Qatari kid, Bader, experiences in his elementary school. He looks to be having difficulty navigating the cultural and linguistic gaps between his home culture and the prevailing culture of the school, which is predominantly English-speaking. This emphasizes the significance of cultural and language sensitivity and diversity in education. In terms of why things are the way they are, it is possible that the school is not meeting the needs of kids from non-dominant cultures and languages sufficiently. This could be due to a lack of resources, training, or comprehension on the part of teachers and administrators. Furthermore, societal attitudes and views regarding language and culture may contribute to this issue. Some solutions that could be taken at the classroom, school, and community levels to alleviate the issues experienced by boys like Bader include: Bilingual or multilingual education: This could include non-dominant language language programs, as well as hiring instructors and personnel that are fluent in various languages. Cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff: This would help guarantee that school personnel are aware of and attentive to all pupils' cultural and linguistic needs. Community involvement and outreach may entail collaborating with community organizations and leaders to involve parents and families in the educational process, which can aid in the development of trust and understanding between the school and the community. Inclusive teaching strategies: To create a more inclusive learning environment, employ inclusive teaching approaches such as the utilization of real-world examples and active learning.
