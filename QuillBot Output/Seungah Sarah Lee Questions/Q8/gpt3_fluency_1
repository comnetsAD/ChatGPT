My initial impression to the short film "Bader" is that it emphasizes the difficulties that young children from minority cultures confront in a school system that may not completely comprehend or appreciate their cultural heritage. Bader, a young Qatari boy, is portrayed in the film as having to manage the cultural differences and expectations between his home and school life. Cultural identity, cultural mismatch, and the importance of education in influencing societal standards are among the film's themes. Bader's story exemplifies the notion that the prevailing culture in schools frequently promotes Western standards and values, resulting in cultural mismatches for pupils from minority cultures. To address the issues that boys like Bader confront, I would suggest a number of solutions that can be applied in the classroom, school, and community. Teachers should try to create a culturally inclusive and responsive classroom environment in the classroom. This can be accomplished through introducing multicultural education into the curriculum, appreciating and honoring all students' cultural backgrounds, and encouraging cultural knowledge and empathy among students. Educators should endeavor to foster a more culturally diverse and inclusive school culture. This can be accomplished by giving cultural competency training to teachers and professional development opportunities that focus on cultural understanding. In addition, the curriculum and school activities should include a wider spectrum of cultures. Schools should collaborate with families and community organizations to foster cultural awareness and appreciation at the community level. This can be accomplished through including families and community organizations in school activities and events, as well as collaborating with them to develop programs and initiatives that enhance cultural awareness and appreciation. In general, it is critical to recognize and respect students' cultural identities, as well as to give support and resources that help bridge the cultural divide between home and school.
