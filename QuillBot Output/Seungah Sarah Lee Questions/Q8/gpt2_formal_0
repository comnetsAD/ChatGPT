Based on the short film "Bader," I initially feel compassion for the young Qatari boy and the difficulties he faces in elementary school. The film focuses on the cultural and linguistic barriers he faces as a non-native English speaker in an English-dominant classroom. In addition, the film touches on the topic of cultural identity and the pressure Bader feels to conform to the westernized norms of his school environment, despite his efforts to maintain his cultural heritage. A few recommendations could be considered at the classroom, school, and community levels to address these challenges. In the classroom, providing non-native English speakers with additional support, such as bilingual or ESL (English as a Second Language) instruction, can help to overcome the language barrier and improve academic outcomes for students like Bader. In addition, incorporating cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff can help create a classroom environment that is more inclusive and tolerant. Creating opportunities for cultural exchange and understanding at the school level, such as cultural fairs or guest speakers, can foster a greater appreciation and comprehension of diverse cultural backgrounds and experiences. Additionally, actively seeking out and involving parents and community members from diverse backgrounds can help create a more inclusive and welcoming school community. At the level of the community, providing resources and support for families to maintain and strengthen their cultural heritage and identity, such as language classes or cultural activities, can support the cultural identity of children like Bader. Additionally, addressing and challenging any structural inequalities, such as discrimination or marginalization, that may exist in the community can help to create a more equitable and inclusive society for all.
