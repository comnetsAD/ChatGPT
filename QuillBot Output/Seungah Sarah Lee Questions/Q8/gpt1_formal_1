The short film Bader emphasizes the cultural and language obstacles that the young Qatari kid Bader faces in elementary school, per my initial impression. It looks that he is having difficulty navigating the cultural and linguistic contrasts between his home culture and the predominantly English-speaking culture of the school. This demonstrates the significance of cultural and language sensitivity and inclusiveness in the educational system. It is probable that the school does not sufficiently address the needs of pupils from non-dominant cultures and languages as a cause for the current state of affairs. This may be due to a lack of resources, training, or comprehension on the part of school administration and employees. Additionally, cultural beliefs and attitudes regarding language and culture may contribute to this issue. In order to alleviate the difficulties faced by boys like Bader, the following suggestions could be implemented at the classroom, school, and community levels: This could involve giving language classes for non-dominant languages and employing teachers and employees with proficiency in many languages. Cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff: This would guarantee that school personnel are aware of and attentive to the cultural and linguistic needs of every student. Community involvement and outreach may involve collaborating with community organizations and leaders to involve parents and families in the education process, thereby fostering mutual trust and understanding between the school and the community. This could involve employing inclusive teaching methods, such as the use of real-world examples and active learning, in order to create a more inclusive learning environment.
