My first impression of the short film "Bader" is that it emphasizes the difficulties young children from minority cultures face in a school system that might not fully comprehend or value their cultural background. In the movie, a young Qatari boy named Bader struggles to balance the cultural norms and expectations of his home and school life. Cultural identity, cultural clash, and the influence of education on societal norms are some of the themes explored in the movie. Bader's experience supports the notion that Western norms and values are frequently prioritized in schools, which can lead to a cultural mismatch for students from minority cultures. I would suggest a number of strategies that can be used in the classroom, school, and community to address the difficulties that boys like Bader face. At the classroom level, teachers should work to foster a diverse and accepting learning environment. This can be accomplished by integrating multicultural education into the curriculum, valuing and celebrating each student's cultural heritage, and encouraging cross-cultural awareness and empathy among the students. A more inclusive and diverse school culture should be developed at the school level by educators. This can be achieved by offering professional development opportunities that emphasize cultural understanding and cultural competency training for teachers. Additionally, the curriculum and extracurricular activities at the school ought to reflect a wider range of cultural traditions. Schools should collaborate with families and community organizations to encourage cultural appreciation and understanding at the local level. This can be achieved by including families and community organizations in extracurricular activities and school events, as well as by collaborating with them to develop initiatives and programs that advance cultural awareness and appreciation. In general, it's critical to recognize and value students' cultural identities, as well as to offer support and resources that can help students' home and school cultures become more compatible.
