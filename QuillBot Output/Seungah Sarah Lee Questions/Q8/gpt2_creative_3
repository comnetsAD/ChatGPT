After seeing the short video "Bader," my first impression was sympathy for the little Qatari child and the difficulties he encounters at his primary school. The video focuses on the linguistic and cultural challenges he faces as a foreign student in an English-speaking school. The film also explores cultural identity, showing how Bader struggles to stay true to his roots while facing pressure to assimilate into his mostly Western high school. There are a few suggestions that might be taken at the school, district, and community levels to combat these issues. If kids like Bader are having trouble communicating in class due to their language barrier, interventions like bilingual or ESL (English as a Second Language) education may assist. Cultural sensitivity training for educators may also improve classroom dynamics by fostering mutual respect and acceptance among students of different backgrounds. A deeper awareness and understanding of other cultural origins and experiences may be fostered in the classroom via the organization of cultural exchange and understanding events, such as cultural fairs or guest lecturers. Inviting and integrating parents and people of the community who represent a range of perspectives and experiences may also help make a school seem more inviting and inclusive. Children like Bader may benefit from community efforts to preserve and celebrate cultural diversity by offering language programs and cultural events that bring people of different backgrounds together. A more just and inclusive society may be achieved through actively combating prejudice and marginalization, as well as other forms of structural inequality.
