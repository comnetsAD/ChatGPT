Based on the short film "Bader," I first feel compassion for the little Qatari child and the difficulties he encounters in elementary school. The video focuses on the cultural and linguistic obstacles he faces as a non-native English speaker in an English-dominant school. In addition, the film deals on the topic of cultural identity and the pressure Bader feels to adapt to the westernized standards of his educational environment, despite his efforts to keep his cultural heritage. A few proposals might be made at the classroom, school, and community levels to address these difficulties. In the classroom, offering non-native English speakers with extra assistance, such as bilingual or ESL (English as a Second Language) training, may help to overcome the language barrier and enhance academic achievements for kids like Bader. In addition, including cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff may assist establish a classroom climate that is more inclusive and tolerant. Creating chances for cultural interchange and understanding at the school level, such as cultural fairs or guest lecturers, helps foster a broader awareness and comprehension of other cultural origins and experiences. Additionally, actively seeking out and incorporating parents and community people from varied backgrounds may help establish a more inclusive and welcoming school community. At the level of the community, offering resources and assistance for families to keep and build their cultural history and identity, such as language lessons or cultural events, may boost the cultural identification of children like Bader. Additionally, addressing and challenging any structural inequalities, such as prejudice or marginalization, that may exist in the community may assist to establish a more equitable and inclusive society for everyone.
