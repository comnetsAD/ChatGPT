The short video "Bader" shows the issues minority children confront in a school system that may not comprehend or respect their culture. Bader, a young Qatari boy, struggles to balance home and school culture in the film. The video explores cultural identity, mismatch, and education's influence on society. Bader's experience shows that schools' dominant culture generally promotes Western standards and ideals, which might alienate minority pupils. I suggest classroom, school, and community remedies for guys like Bader. Teachers should develop a multicultural classroom. Multicultural education, recognizing all students' cultures, and fostering cultural knowledge and empathy may achieve this. Schools should promote cultural diversity and inclusion. Cultural competence training for teachers and cultural awareness professional development may achieve this. The curriculum and activities should also include additional cultures. Schools should encourage cultural awareness and appreciation with families and community groups. Families and community groups may be included in school activities and events to establish cultural awareness and appreciation programs. It's crucial to recognize kids' cultural identities and give assistance and tools to bridge the cultural divide between home and school.
