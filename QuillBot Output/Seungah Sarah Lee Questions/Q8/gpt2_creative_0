After watching the short film "Bader," my first impression was sympathy for the young Qatari boy and the difficulties he faces at his elementary school. The film focuses on the linguistic and cultural challenges he faces as a foreign student in an English-speaking classroom. The film also explores cultural identity, showing how Bader struggles to stay true to his heritage while facing pressure to assimilate into his predominantly Western high school. There are a few suggestions that could be considered at the school, district, and community levels to combat these issues. If students like Bader are having trouble communicating in class due to their language barrier, interventions like bilingual or ESL (English as a Second Language) instruction can help. Cultural sensitivity training for educators can also improve classroom dynamics by fostering mutual respect and acceptance among students of different backgrounds. A greater appreciation and understanding of different cultural backgrounds and experiences can be fostered in the classroom through the organization of cultural exchange and understanding events, such as cultural fairs or guest speakers. Inviting and involving parents and members of the community who represent a range of perspectives and experiences can also help make a school feel more welcoming and inclusive. Children like Bader can benefit from community efforts to preserve and celebrate cultural diversity by offering language classes and cultural activities that bring people of different backgrounds together. A more just and inclusive society can be achieved by actively combating discrimination and marginalization, as well as other forms of structural inequality.
