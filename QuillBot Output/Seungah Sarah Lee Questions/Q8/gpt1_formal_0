The short film Bader highlights the cultural and linguistic obstacles that the young Qatari boy Bader faces in elementary school, per my initial reaction. It appears that he is having difficulty navigating the cultural and linguistic differences between his home culture and the predominantly English-speaking culture of the school. This demonstrates the significance of cultural and linguistic sensitivity and inclusiveness in the educational system. It is possible that the school does not adequately address the needs of students from non-dominant cultures and languages as a cause for the current state of affairs. This may be due to a lack of resources, training, or comprehension on the part of school administrators and staff. Additionally, societal beliefs and attitudes regarding language and culture may contribute to this issue. In order to address the difficulties faced by boys like Bader, the following suggestions could be implemented at the classroom, school, and community levels: This could include offering language classes for non-dominant languages and employing teachers and staff with proficiency in multiple languages. Cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff: This would ensure that school personnel are aware of and sensitive to the cultural and linguistic needs of every student. Community engagement and outreach may involve collaborating with community organizations and leaders to involve parents and families in the education process, thereby fostering mutual trust and understanding between the school and the community. This could involve employing inclusive teaching methods, such as the use of real-world examples and active learning, in order to create a more inclusive learning environment.
