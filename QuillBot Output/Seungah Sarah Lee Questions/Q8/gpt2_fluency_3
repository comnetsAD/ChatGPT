My immediate response to the short video "Bader" is one of pity for the little Qatari child and the obstacles he experiences in elementary school. The documentary focuses on the cultural and linguistic challenges he faces as a non-native English speaker in a school where English is the predominant language of teaching. Furthermore, the film explores the issue of cultural identity, namely the pressure Bader feels to adapt to the westernized standards of his educational setting while striving to preserve a connection to his own cultural history. There are a few proposals that might be addressed at the classroom, school, and community levels to address these difficulties. Providing extra assistance for non-native English speakers in the classroom, such as bilingual or ESL (English as a Second Language) education, may help to bridge the language barrier and enhance academic achievement for kids like Bader. Including cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff may also contribute to a more inclusive and understanding classroom atmosphere. Cultural exchange and understanding opportunities, such as cultural fairs or guest lecturers, may foster a broader awareness and understanding of other cultural origins and experiences at the school level. Furthermore, actively seeking out and incorporating parents and community people from various backgrounds in the school community may aid in the creation of a more inclusive and welcoming atmosphere. Community services and assistance for families to keep and build their cultural history and identity, such as language lessons or cultural events, may help to support youngsters like Bader's cultural identification. Working to address and fight any structural inequalities that may exist in the community, such as prejudice or marginalization, may also contribute to the creation of a more equitable and inclusive society for everyone.
