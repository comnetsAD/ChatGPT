My initial reaction to the short film "Bader" is that it highlights the difficulties young children from minority cultures face in a school system that may not fully comprehend or value their cultural background. Bader, a young Qatari boy, struggles to negotiate the cultural differences and expectations between his home and school life in the film. Cultural identity, cultural mismatch, and the role of education in shaping societal norms are themes of the film. Bader's experience illustrates the notion that the dominant culture in schools frequently prioritizes Western norms and values, which can create a cultural mismatch for minority students. To address the difficulties faced by boys like Bader, I would recommend a number of classroom, school, and community-level interventions. Teachers should strive to create a classroom environment that is culturally inclusive and responsive. This can be accomplished by incorporating multicultural education into the curriculum, valuing and celebrating the cultural backgrounds of all students, and encouraging cultural awareness and empathy among students. Educators should work to create a school culture that is more culturally diverse and inclusive. This can be accomplished by providing professional development opportunities that emphasize cultural understanding and training teachers in cultural competence. The school should also incorporate a wider variety of cultures into its curriculum and extracurricular activities. Schools should collaborate with families and community organizations to promote cultural understanding and appreciation at the community level. This can be accomplished by involving families and community organizations in school activities and events and by collaborating with them to develop programs and initiatives that promote cultural appreciation and understanding. In general, it is crucial to recognize and respect the cultural identity of students and to provide support and resources that help bridge the cultural divide between home and school.
