As a result of watching the short film "Bader," my first reaction was one of sympathy for the little Qatari child and the difficulties he encounters while attending elementary school. The documentary sheds light on the cultural and linguistic obstacles that he faces in a classroom where English is used as the major language of instruction due to the fact that he is not a natural speaker of the language. In addition, the movie focuses with the topic of cultural identity, as well as the pressure that Bader feels to adapt to the westernized norms of his educational environment, but at the same time he is striving to keep connection to his own cultural history. At the levels of the classroom, the school, and the community, there are a few ideas that might be taken into consideration in order to address these difficulties. Students like Bader who are non-native English speakers can have a better chance of succeeding academically if their teachers offer bilingual or ESL (English as a Second Language) instruction in the classroom. This can help to overcome the language barrier that exists between the two groups of students and improve academic outcomes. In addition, providing educators and support staff with cultural sensitivity training can assist in the development of classroom environments that are more accepting and understanding of many perspectives. At the level of the school, the promotion of greater respect and understanding of diverse cultural origins and experiences can be facilitated by the creation of opportunities for cultural interchange and comprehension, such as cultural fairs or lecturers from other cultures. Furthermore, actively seeking out and incorporating community people and parents of the school community who come from a variety of backgrounds can assist contribute to the development of an environment that is more inclusive and accepting. Children who have a cultural identity like Bader's can have that identity supported on a community level by the provision of resources and support for families to help them preserve and strengthen their cultural heritage and identity. These resources and supports can take the form of cultural activities or language classes. In addition, working to address and confront any structural inequalities that may exist in the community, such as prejudice or marginalization, can help to contribute to the creation of a society that is more equitable and welcoming for everyone.
