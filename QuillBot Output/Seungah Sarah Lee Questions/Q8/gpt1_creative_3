In my first viewing of the short film Bader, I was struck by how it depicted the language and cultural barriers that a young Qatari kid, Bader, encountered in an American primary school. It seems that he is having difficulty adjusting to the mostly Anglo-American educational environment, where he faces significant cultural and language barriers. This shows how vital it is for schools to be welcoming and accepting of students of all backgrounds and languages. One probable explanation for the current state of affairs is that the school is failing to meet the needs of its pupils who come from culturally and linguistically underrepresented groups. One possible explanation is that teachers and administrators just don't know what they don't know. There is a possibility that widespread misconceptions regarding the role of language and culture in shaping today's society are partly to blame. Some suggestions that may be applied in the classroom, school, and community to help boys like Bader overcome the obstacles they encounter include: Offering instruction in languages that are less often spoken, as well as recruiting and retaining faculty and staff with linguistic versatility, are all ways to achieve this goal of providing bilingual or multilingual education. Education professionals may benefit from cultural sensitivity training if they were better prepared to meet the diverse language and cultural demands of their pupils. Involving parents and families in the educational process via collaboration with community groups and leaders is one way to foster mutual trust and appreciation between the school and its surrounding neighborhood. To create a more welcoming classroom, teachers should use inclusive teaching tactics including using real-world examples and encouraging students to take an active role in their education.
