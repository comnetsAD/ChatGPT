My initial response, based on the short film "Bader," is one of sympathy for the young Qatari boy and the difficulties he encounters in his elementary school. He encounters linguistic and cultural barriers as a non-native English speaker in a classroom where English is the main language of instruction, which are highlighted in the movie. The movie also addresses the issue of cultural identity, specifically the pressure Bader faces to fit in with the westernized standards of his school environment while still trying to stay connected to his own cultural roots. There are a few suggestions that could be taken into account at the classroom, school, and community levels to address these issues. In the classroom, giving non-native English speakers additional support in the form of bilingual or ESL (English as a Second Language) instruction can help students like Bader overcome the language barrier and achieve better academic results. Incorporating cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff can also contribute to the development of a more accepting and understanding learning environment. A greater appreciation and understanding of various cultural backgrounds and experiences can be encouraged at the school level by providing opportunities for cultural exchange and understanding, such as cultural fairs or guest speakers. A more inclusive and welcoming environment can also be produced by actively seeking out and involving parents and community members from various backgrounds. The cultural identity of kids like Bader can be supported at the community level by offering resources and assistance to families so they can preserve and strengthen their cultural heritage and identity, such as language classes or cultural activities. A more equitable and inclusive society can be developed for all by working to address and challenge any structural inequalities that may exist in the community, such as marginalization or discrimination.
