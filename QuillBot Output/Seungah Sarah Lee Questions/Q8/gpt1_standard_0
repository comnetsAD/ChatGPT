My first impression after watching the short film Bader is that it emphasizes the difficulties that the young Qatari boy, Bader, encounters in his elementary school due to language and cultural barriers. He seems to be having trouble adjusting to the linguistic and cultural differences between his native country and the school's dominant culture, which is largely English-speaking. This demonstrates how crucial it is for the educational system to be inclusive and sensitive to cultural and linguistic differences. It's possible that the school is not meeting the needs of students from non-dominant cultures and languages, which would explain why things are the way they are. This might be as a result of a lack of resources, knowledge, or training on the part of teachers and administrators. The issue may also be influenced by societal attitudes and beliefs about language and culture. Some suggestions that could be put into practice in the classroom, school, and community in order to address the difficulties faced by boys like Bader include: Providing bilingual or multilingual education could entail employing teachers and staff who are multilingual as well as offering language classes for minor languages. Training in cultural sensitivity for teachers and staff would help to make sure that school personnel are aware of and sensitive to the needs of all students, regardless of their culture or language. Community outreach and engagement: This may entail collaborating with local leaders and organizations to involve parents and families in the educational process, which can help to foster a sense of mutual respect and trust between the school and the community. In order to create a more inclusive learning environment, inclusive teaching strategies may be used, such as the use of practical examples and active learning.
