When I first watched the short film "Bader," my initial thought was that it well depicted the difficulties that young children from minority cultures confront when attending a school that may not fully comprehend or appreciate their cultural heritage. Bader, a young Qatari kid, is shown in the video grappling with the gulf between his family's values and those of his school. Cultural identity, cultural mismatch, and the power of education to change minds are all explored throughout the film. Students from minority cultures may feel out of place in an institutional setting where Western values and conventions are privileged, as Bader found to be the case in his own education. I have numerous suggestions for addressing the issues faced by guys like Bader that can be addressed in the classroom, the school, and the community as a whole. It is the responsibility of instructors to foster a classroom that is welcoming and respectful of students of all backgrounds. Multicultural education can accomplish these goals by helping students learn about other cultures while still recognizing and enjoying their own. Educators should strive for a more welcoming and varied school climate. To that end, it is important to provide instructors with cultural competency training and other forms of professional development that emphasize intercultural understanding. In addition, the school should make an effort to increase cultural diversity through lessons and extracurriculars. The best way for schools to foster cross-cultural knowledge and appreciation is through partnerships with families and local groups. The best way to accomplish this is for the school to collaborate with community groups and families to develop cultural awareness and appreciation programs and events. In general, it is beneficial to recognize and value students' cultural identities and to offer them resources that can help them feel more at home at school.
