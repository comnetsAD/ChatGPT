Based on the short film "Bader," I empathize with the little Qatari boy and his elementary school struggles. The film shows his cultural and linguistic challenges as a non-native English speaker in an English-speaking classroom. The film also explores cultural identity and Bader's struggle to conform to his school's westernized ideals while maintaining his native heritage. Classroom, school, and community recommendations can address these issues. Bilingual or ESL instruction can assist children like Bader overcome the language barrier and enhance academic achievements. Cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff can also improve classroom culture. Cultural fairs and guest lecturers can help students appreciate and comprehend diverse cultures. Including various parents and community people in the school community can also make it more inclusive. Language classes and cultural events for families can help children like Bader keep their cultural identity at the community level. Addressing structural disparities like prejudice and marginalization can also assist establish a more fair and inclusive society.
