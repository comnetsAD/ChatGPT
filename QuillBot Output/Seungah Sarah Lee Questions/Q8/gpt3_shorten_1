The short video "Bader" shows the issues minority children confront in a school system that may not comprehend or appreciate their culture. Bader, a young Qatari boy, struggles to balance home and school culture in the film. The video explores cultural identity, mismatch, and education's influence on society. Bader's experience shows that schools' dominant culture generally promotes Western standards and ideals, which might alienate minority pupils. I suggest classroom, school, and community remedies for boys like Bader. Teachers should develop a multicultural classroom. Multicultural education, recognizing all students' cultures, and fostering cultural knowledge and empathy can achieve this. Schools should promote cultural diversity and inclusion. Cultural competency training for teachers and cultural awareness professional development can achieve this. The curriculum and activities should also include more cultures. Schools should encourage cultural awareness and appreciation with families and community organizations. Families and community organizations can be included in school activities and events to establish cultural awareness and appreciation programs. It's crucial to recognize students' cultural identities and provide support and resources to bridge the cultural divide between home and school.
