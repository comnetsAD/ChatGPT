After viewing the short film "Bader," my first thought was that it brought to light the difficulties, both cultural and linguistic, that a young Qatari kid named Bader encounters while attending the primary school where he lives. It would seem that he is having difficulty navigating the cultural and linguistic disparities that exist between the culture of his household and the culture that predominates at the school, which is largely an English-speaking society. This demonstrates how vital it is for educational institutions to demonstrate cultural and language awareness and to welcome students of all backgrounds. Regarding the reasons why things are the way they are, it is conceivable that the school is not catering to the requirements of pupils who come from cultures and languages that are not the prevailing culture or language. It's possible that this is due to a lack of resources, training, or comprehension on the side of school administration and personnel. Furthermore, the attitudes and ideas held by society towards language and culture may also be a factor in the creation of this issue. In order to help guys like Bader overcome the problems they are up against, the following are some suggestions for actions that may be taken in the classroom, at the school, and in the community as a whole: Providing a bilingual or multilingual education: This might involve recruiting instructors and personnel who are fluent in various languages, in addition to giving language programs for non-dominant languages. Training for teachers and staff in cultural sensitivity would serve to ensure that school personnel are aware of, and sensitive to, the cultural and language requirements of all pupils. This training would be provided to teachers and staff. Community involvement and outreach may include working with community groups and leaders to involve parents and families in the educational process. This may contribute to the development of trust and understanding between the school and the community. Teaching techniques that are inclusive might include employing real-world examples and engaging in active learning to create a more welcoming atmosphere for education. This is one example of a strategy that falls under the category of "inclusive teaching strategies."
