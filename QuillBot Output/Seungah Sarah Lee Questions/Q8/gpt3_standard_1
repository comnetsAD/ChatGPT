My first impression of the short film "Bader" is that it emphasizes the difficulties young children from minority cultures experience in a school system that could not completely comprehend or value their cultural background. In the movie, a young Qatari boy named Bader struggles to balance the cultural norms and demands of his family and school life. Cultural identity, cultural clash, and the influence of education on societal norms are some of the themes explored in the movie. Bader's experience supports the notion that Western norms and values are frequently prioritized in schools, which can lead to a cultural mismatch for pupils from minority cultures. I would suggest a number of strategies that might be used in the classroom, school, and community to address the difficulties that guys like Bader confront. At the classroom level, instructors should work to foster a diverse and accepting learning environment. This can be accomplished through integrating multicultural education into the curriculum, appreciating and honoring each student's cultural heritage, and encouraging cross-cultural awareness and empathy among the students. A more inclusive and varied school culture should be developed at the school level by educators. This can be achieved by offering professional development opportunities that emphasize cultural understanding and cultural competency training for instructors. Additionally, the curriculum and extracurricular activities at the school ought to reflect a wider diversity of cultural traditions. Schools should collaborate with families and community organizations to encourage cultural appreciation and understanding at the local level. This can be achieved through including families and community organizations in extracurricular activities and school events, as well as by collaborating with them to develop initiatives and programs that advance cultural awareness and appreciation. In general, it's critical to recognize and value kids' cultural identities, as well as to offer support and tools that can help students' home and school cultures become more compatible.
