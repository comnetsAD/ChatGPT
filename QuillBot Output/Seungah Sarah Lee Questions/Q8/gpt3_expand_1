The first thing that sprang to mind when I watched the short video "Bader" was that it brought to light the difficulties that young children from minority cultures confront when attending schools that may not completely comprehend or appreciate the significance of their cultural heritage. Bader, a young kid from Qatar, is depicted in the movie as having difficulty navigating the cultural gaps and expectations that exist between his life at home and his life at school. The film explores a variety of topics, including cultural identity, cultural incompatibility, and the influence of education on the standards of society. Bader's experience lends credence to the theory that the prevailing culture in schools frequently gives Western standards and values a higher priority, which can result in a cultural mismatch for students who come from cultural groups who are underrepresented in the institution. I would suggest various solutions that can be adopted at the classroom, school, and community levels in order to address the issues that are faced by boys like Bader. These ideas can be applied. At the level of the classroom, it is the responsibility of instructors to work toward creating an environment that is culturally inclusive and sensitive. This can be accomplished by include multicultural education in the course material, recognizing and appreciating the unique cultural traditions that each student brings to the classroom, and encouraging students to develop cultural awareness and empathy for one another. Educators should aim towards making schools more culturally diverse and welcoming environments in order to better serve their students. This can be accomplished through the training of educators in cultural competency and the provision of opportunities for professional development that place an emphasis on cultural comprehension. In addition to this, the curriculum and extracurricular activities at the school must to make use of a wider variety of cultural traditions. To foster an awareness and knowledge of different cultures at the community level, schools should collaborate with families and other community organizations. This can be accomplished through having families and community organizations participate in school activities and events, as well as by collaborating with these groups to design and implement programs and initiatives that foster cultural awareness and understanding. In general, it is essential to recognize and respect the cultural identities of students, as well as to offer support and resources that contribute to the reduction of the cultural divide that exists between the student's home and their educational environment.
