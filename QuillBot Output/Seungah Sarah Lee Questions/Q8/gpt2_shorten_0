Based on the short film "Bader," I empathize with the young Qatari boy and his elementary school challenges. The film shows his cultural and linguistic challenges as a non-native English speaker in an English-speaking classroom. The film also explores cultural identity and Bader's struggle to conform to his school's westernized norms while maintaining his cultural heritage. Classroom, school, and community recommendations can address these issues. Bilingual or ESL instruction can help students like Bader overcome the language barrier and improve academic outcomes. Cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff can also improve classroom culture. Cultural fairs and guest speakers can help students appreciate and understand different cultures. Including diverse parents and community members in the school community can also make it more inclusive. Language classes and cultural activities for families can help children like Bader maintain their cultural identity at the community level. Addressing structural inequalities like discrimination and marginalization can also help create a more equitable and inclusive society.
