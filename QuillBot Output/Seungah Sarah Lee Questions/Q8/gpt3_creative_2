While I first watched the short film "Bader," my immediate thought was that it well depicted the difficulties that young children from minority cultures confront when attending a school that may not completely comprehend or respect their cultural heritage. Bader, a young Qatari kid, is seen in the video grappling with the gulf between his family's values and those of his school. Cultural identity, cultural mismatch, and the power of education to change minds are all explored throughout the film. Students from minority cultures may feel out of place in an institutional setting where Western values and conventions are privileged, as Bader found to be the case in his own education. I have numerous suggestions for addressing the issues faced by guys like Bader that may be addressed in the classroom, the school, and the community as a whole. It is the responsibility of instructors to foster a classroom that is welcoming and respectful of students of all backgrounds. Multicultural education may accomplish these goals by helping students learn about other cultures while still recognizing and enjoying their own. Educators should strive for a more welcoming and varied school climate. To that end, it is important to provide instructors with cultural competence training and other forms of professional development that emphasize intercultural awareness. In addition, the school should make an effort to increase cultural diversity through lessons and extracurriculars. The best way for schools to foster cross-cultural knowledge and appreciation is via partnerships with families and local groups. The best way to do this is for the school to collaborate with community groups and families to develop cultural awareness and appreciation programs and events. In general, it is beneficial to recognize and value kids' cultural identities and to offer them tools that might help them feel more at home at school.
