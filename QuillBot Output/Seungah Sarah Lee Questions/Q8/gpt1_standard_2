My first impression after viewing the short video Bader is that it emphasizes the difficulties that the young Qatari kid, Bader, encounters at his primary school due to language and cultural barriers. He seems to be having trouble adjusting to the language and cultural disparities between his own country and the school's dominant culture, which is largely English-speaking. This demonstrates how crucial it is for the educational system to be inclusive and sensitive to cultural and language differences. It's likely that the school is not meeting the requirements of children from non-dominant cultures and languages, which would explain why things are the way they are. This could be as a result of a lack of resources, knowledge, or training on the side of teachers and administrators. The issue may also be influenced by social attitudes and views regarding language and culture. Some suggestions that may be put into practice in the classroom, school, and community in order to solve the difficulties experienced by boys like Bader include: Providing bilingual or multilingual education might entail employing instructors and personnel who are multilingual as well as delivering language lessons for minor languages. Training in cultural sensitivity for teachers and staff would assist to make sure that school personnel are aware of and attentive to the needs of all pupils, regardless of their culture or language. Community outreach and engagement: This may entail collaborating with local leaders and groups to involve parents and families in the educational process, which may assist to foster a sense of mutual respect and trust between the school and the community. In order to create a more inclusive learning environment, inclusive teaching tactics may be used, such as the use of practical examples and active learning.
