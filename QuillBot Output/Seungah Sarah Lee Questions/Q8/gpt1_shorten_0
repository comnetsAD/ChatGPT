Bader, a Qatari boy in elementary school, faces cultural and linguistic challenges. He seems to be having trouble adjusting to the school's English-speaking culture and his home culture. Cultural and linguistic sensitivity and inclusivity in education are crucial. The school may not be meeting the needs of non-dominant culture and language students. School administrators may lack resources, training, or understanding. Societal language and culture beliefs may also contribute to this issue. Some classroom, school, and community solutions for boys like Bader include: Bilingual or multilingual education: This could include teaching non-dominant languages and hiring bilingual teachers and staff. Cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff: This would help school staff understand and respect students' cultural and linguistic needs. Community engagement and outreach: Working with community organizations and leaders to involve parents and families in education can build trust and understanding between the school and the community. Inclusive teaching strategies: Real-world examples and active learning can create a more inclusive learning environment.
