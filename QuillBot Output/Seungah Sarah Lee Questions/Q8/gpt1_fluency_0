My first impression after watching the short film Bader is that it emphasizes the cultural and linguistic challenges that the young Qatari boy, Bader, faces in his elementary school. He appears to be having difficulty navigating the cultural and linguistic differences between his home culture and the dominant culture of the school, which is predominantly English-speaking. This emphasizes the significance of cultural and linguistic sensitivity and inclusivity in education. In terms of why things are the way they are, it is possible that the school is not meeting the needs of students from non-dominant cultures and languages adequately. This could be due to a lack of resources, training, or comprehension on the part of teachers and administrators. Furthermore, societal attitudes and beliefs about language and culture may contribute to this issue. Some recommendations that could be implemented at the classroom, school, and community levels to address the challenges faced by boys like Bader include: Bilingual or multilingual education: This could include non-dominant language language classes, as well as hiring teachers and staff who are fluent in multiple languages. Cultural sensitivity training for teachers and staff: This would help ensure that school personnel are aware of and sensitive to all students' cultural and linguistic needs. Community engagement and outreach may entail collaborating with community organizations and leaders to involve parents and families in the educational process, which can aid in the development of trust and understanding between the school and the community. Inclusive teaching strategies: To create a more inclusive learning environment, use inclusive teaching methods such as the use of real-world examples and active learning.
