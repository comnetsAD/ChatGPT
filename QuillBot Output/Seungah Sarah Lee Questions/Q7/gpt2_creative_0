In addition to equipping students with the knowledge and skills they'll need to participate in the workforce and other aspects of society, formal education and schooling play a significant role in socializing individuals into society by teaching them the norms, values, and beliefs of their culture. An individual's socialization experience shapes and influences their life outcomes by providing them with the opportunity to acquire the knowledge, skills, and values necessary for success in their chosen field and by assisting them in developing the social networks and relationships that can be important to achieving their goals. However, poverty, discrimination, and a lack of access to quality education are all structural factors that can limit an individual's opportunities and shape their socialization experience in ways that can have a negative effect on life outcomes. In such a setting, meritocracy, the principle that people should be rewarded for their efforts rather than their position, can be challenging to implement. While meritocracy is often held up as the ideal, it is important to recognize that certain groups of people may find it difficult to succeed based on their abilities and effort alone due to structural factors and historical discrimination. Because of this, it may be more accurate to call meritocracy an ideal or a myth.
