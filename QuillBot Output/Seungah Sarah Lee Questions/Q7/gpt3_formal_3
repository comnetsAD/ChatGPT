Education and education play a crucial part in socializing people into society by teaching them the cultural norms, values, and beliefs. This process may impact a person's ideas, attitudes, and actions, as well as their life results. Socialization via education may also perpetuate social disparities, since some groups may have less access to excellent education and consequently be at a disadvantage in terms of life outcomes and possibilities. In a culture where structural issues such as race, class, and gender influence access to education and opportunity, meritocracy may be a fallacy. These characteristics may impede an individual's capacity to attain success solely on the basis of his or her merit, and may instead be moulded by forces outside his or her control. However, a meritocracy may be achieved by aggressively addressing and reducing structural disparities in society and the education system.
