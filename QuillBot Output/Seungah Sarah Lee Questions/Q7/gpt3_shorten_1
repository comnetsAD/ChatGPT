Schooling instills the values, norms, and beliefs of a culture and socializes people. This process can influence a person's ideas, attitudes, and behavior and life consequences. Education can also perpetuate societal disparities because some groups have less access to quality education and hence fewer chances and life outcomes. In a culture where race, class, and gender determine an individual's access to education and opportunity, meritocracy may be a fallacy. These circumstances may prevent people from succeeding solely on merit alone. By addressing structural inequities in society and education, meritocracy can be achieved.
