Education and schooling play an important role in socializing individuals into society by teaching them cultural norms, values, and beliefs, as well as providing them with the knowledge and skills necessary to participate in the workforce and other aspects of society. The socialization experience shapes and influences an individual's life outcomes by allowing them to acquire the knowledge, skills, and values required to succeed in their chosen field and by assisting them in developing the social networks and relationships that can be important in achieving their goals. However, structural factors such as poverty, discrimination, and a lack of access to a high-quality education can limit an individual's opportunities and shape their socialization experience in ways that can have a negative impact on their life outcomes. Meritocracy, the belief that individuals should be rewarded based on their abilities and effort, can be difficult to achieve in this context. While the ideal of meritocracy is frequently extolled, it is critical to recognize that structural factors and historical discrimination can create barriers to opportunity for certain groups of people, making it difficult for them to succeed solely on the basis of their abilities and effort. As a result, it might be more accurate to describe meritocracy as a myth or an ideal that is difficult to fully realize in practice.
