Education and schooling can socialize individuals into society by teaching them the norms, values, beliefs, and customs of their culture, as well as the skills and knowledge necessary to function in that society. Education and schooling can also teach individuals the skills and knowledge necessary to function in that society. This process may shape and impact the results of a person's life by influencing the opportunities and resources that are available to that individual. However, it is essential to keep in mind that education and schooling are not the only elements that influence a person's level of socialization; family, community, and culture are all significant contributors. Existing disparities, such as those based on racial and socioeconomic status as well as gender, may often be shown to be maintained by structural reasons as well as the methods by which people are socialized and assigned via the educational system. The concept of meritocracy refers to the idea that people ought to be rewarded based on their own talents and achievements, as opposed to the circumstances of their families and communities. However, there is a widespread belief that meritocracy is a myth. This is due to the fact that structural factors can limit the opportunities and resources that are available to individuals who come from marginalized groups, making it difficult for these individuals to achieve success based solely on their merit. An individual's life outcomes are shaped and influenced by a variety of variables, including structural inequities, and socialization is, in general, a complicated and diverse process. Despite the fact that meritocracy is often seen as a desirable idea, it is critical to acknowledge the ways in which structural barriers may restrict opportunities and resources for underrepresented groups and to work to solve these issues.
