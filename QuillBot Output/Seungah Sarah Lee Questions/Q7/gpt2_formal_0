Education and schooling play an important role in socializing individuals into society by teaching them the norms, values, and beliefs of their culture and equipping them with the knowledge and skills necessary to participate in the workforce and other aspects of society. The socialization experience shapes and influences an individual's life outcomes by providing them with the opportunity to acquire the knowledge, skills, and values required for success in their chosen field and by assisting them in developing the social networks and relationships that can be crucial to achieving their objectives. However, structural factors such as poverty, discrimination, and lack of access to a quality education can limit a person's opportunities and shape their socialization experience in ways that have a negative impact on their life outcomes. Meritocracy, the belief that individuals should be rewarded based on their abilities and effort, can be difficult to achieve in this context. It is important to recognize that structural factors and historical discrimination can create barriers to opportunity for certain groups of people, making it difficult for them to succeed solely on the basis of their abilities and efforts. Consequently, it may be more accurate to refer to meritocracy as a myth or an ideal that is difficult to fully realize in practice.
