Individuals may be socialized into society via education and schooling, which teaches them the norms, values, beliefs, and practices of their culture, as well as the skills and information required to participate in that society. By selecting opportunities and access to resources, this process may shape and affect an individual's life outcomes. It is crucial to highlight, however, that socialization is influenced not just by education and schooling, but also by elements such as family, community, and culture. Furthermore, structural variables and the manner in which people are socialized and assigned via schooling may often reinforce existing disparities, such as those based on race, class, and gender. Meritocracy is the notion that people should be rewarded for their qualities and accomplishments, not their social origins. It is sometimes contended, however, that meritocracy is a fiction since structural barriers may restrict the opportunities and resources accessible to people from underrepresented groups, making it harder for them to attain success solely on merit. Overall, socialization is complicated and multidimensional, with many elements shaping and influencing an individual's life outcomes, including structural inequities. While meritocracy is a desirable notion, it is critical to acknowledge and solve systemic barriers that restrict opportunities and resources for excluded groups.
