By introducing people to the customs, beliefs, and values of the community they live in, education and schooling are crucial in integrating people into society. A person's views, attitudes, and conduct may be shaped by this process, which may also have an impact on how their life turns out. Because some groups of individuals may have less access to high-quality education and are consequently at a disadvantage in terms of opportunities and life outcomes, socialization via education can also serve to maintain societal inequities. In a culture where structural variables like race, class, and gender impact an individual's access to education and opportunities, the concept of meritocracy—the notion that people should be evaluated and rewarded based on their talents and effort—might be a fallacy. These circumstances may not be under an individual's control and may instead hinder their potential to succeed on the basis of their own merits. But if you actively try to address and lessen structural inequities in society and the educational system, you may aim for a meritocracy.
