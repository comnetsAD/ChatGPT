Individuals can be socialized into society through education and schooling, which teaches them the norms, values, beliefs, and customs of their culture, as well as the skills and information required to participate in that society. By selecting opportunities and access to resources, this process can shape and affect an individual's life outcomes. It is crucial to highlight, however, that socialization is influenced not only by education and schooling, but also by elements such as family, community, and culture. Furthermore, structural variables and the ways in which people are socialized and assigned through education can frequently reinforce existing disparities, such as those based on race, class, and gender. Meritocracy is the notion that people should be rewarded for their qualities and accomplishments, not their social backgrounds. It is sometimes contended, however, that meritocracy is a fiction since structural barriers can limit the opportunities and resources accessible to individuals from underrepresented groups, making it harder for them to attain success solely on merit. Overall, socialization is complicated and multifaceted, with many elements shaping and influencing an individual's life outcomes, including structural inequities. While meritocracy is a desirable notion, it is critical to recognize and solve systemic barriers that limit opportunities and resources for excluded groups.
