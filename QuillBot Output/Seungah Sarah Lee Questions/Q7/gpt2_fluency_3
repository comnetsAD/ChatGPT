Education and education play an important role in socializing people into society by teaching them cultural norms, values, and beliefs, as well as equipping them with the information and skills necessary to engage in the labor and other sectors of society. The socialization experience shapes and influences an individual's life outcomes by allowing them to acquire the knowledge, skills, and values required to succeed in their chosen field and by assisting them in developing the social networks and relationships that can be important in achieving their goals. However, structural constraints such as poverty, prejudice, and a lack of access to a high-quality education may restrict an individual's chances and affect their socialization experience in ways that can have a detrimental effect on their life outcomes. Meritocracy, the notion that people should be rewarded based on their talents and effort, might be difficult to implement in this situation. While the concept of meritocracy is often extolled, it is critical to acknowledge that structural constraints and historical prejudice may create hurdles to opportunity for particular groups of individuals, making it impossible for them to achieve solely on the basis of their ability and effort. As a result, it could be more realistic to describe meritocracy as a myth or an ideal that is difficult to completely realize in reality.
