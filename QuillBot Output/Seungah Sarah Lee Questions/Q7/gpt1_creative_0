Individuals can be socialized into society through their educational and scholastic experiences, where they are taught the standards, values, beliefs, and customs of their culture, as well as the skills and knowledge necessary to participate fully in that society. A person's life outcomes can be affected by this procedure because it determines their access to resources and the opportunities available to them. It's true that formal schooling plays a significant role in shaping people's socialization, but other influences, such as those from one's family, neighborhood, and culture, also play a role. Additionally, existing inequalities, such as those based on race, class, and gender, can often be perpetuated by the structural factors and ways in which individuals become socialized and allocated through education. The concept of meritocracy refers to an economic and political system in which people rise through the ranks based on their own merits rather than their family's wealth or social status. It is argued, however, that meritocracy is a myth because people from underrepresented groups often lack access to the resources necessary to succeed based on their own abilities. Overarchingly, socialization is intricate and multi-faceted, and many factors, including structural inequalities, shape and influence an individual's life outcomes. While meritocracy is an appealing idea, it is critical to address the ways in which structural factors can restrict access to resources and opportunities for underrepresented groups.
