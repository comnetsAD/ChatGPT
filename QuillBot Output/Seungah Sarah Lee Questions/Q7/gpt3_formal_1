Education and schooling play a crucial part in socializing individuals into society by teaching them the cultural norms, values, and beliefs. This process can influence a person's ideas, attitudes, and actions, as well as their life results. Socialization through education can also perpetuate societal disparities, since certain groups may have less access to quality education and consequently be at a disadvantage in terms of life outcomes and possibilities. In a society where structural issues such as race, class, and gender influence access to education and opportunity, meritocracy may be a fallacy. These characteristics can impede an individual's capacity to attain success solely on the basis of his or her merit, and may instead be moulded by factors outside his or her control. However, a meritocracy can be achieved by aggressively addressing and reducing structural disparities in society and the education system.
