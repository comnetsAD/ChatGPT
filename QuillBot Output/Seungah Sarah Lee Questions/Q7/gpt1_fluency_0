Individuals can be socialized into society through education and schooling, which teaches them the norms, values, beliefs, and customs of their culture, as well as the skills and knowledge required to function in that society. By determining opportunities and access to resources, this process can shape and influence an individual's life outcomes. It is important to note, however, that socialization is influenced not only by education and schooling, but also by factors such as family, community, and culture. Furthermore, structural factors and the ways in which people are socialized and allocated through education can frequently perpetuate existing inequalities, such as those based on race, class, and gender. Meritocracy is the belief that people should be rewarded for their abilities and efforts, not their social backgrounds. It is frequently argued, however, that meritocracy is a myth because structural factors can limit the opportunities and resources available to individuals from marginalized groups, making it difficult for them to achieve success solely on merit. Overall, socialization is complex and multifaceted, with many factors shaping and influencing an individual's life outcomes, including structural inequalities. While meritocracy is a desirable concept, it is critical to recognize and address structural factors that limit opportunities and resources for marginalized groups.
