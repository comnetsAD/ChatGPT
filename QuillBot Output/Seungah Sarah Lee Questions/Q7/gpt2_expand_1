Education and schooling play a significant role in socializing individuals into society by teaching them the norms, values, and beliefs of their culture. Additionally, education and schooling provide individuals with the knowledge and skills they require in order to participate in the workforce and other aspects of society. The individual has the opportunity to acquire the knowledge, skills, and values necessary to succeed in their chosen field, and the individual receives assistance in developing the social networks and relationships that can be important for achieving their goals as a result of the socialization experience, which both shapes and influences the individual's life outcomes. The individual's life outcomes are shaped and influenced by the socialization experience. However, structural constraints such as poverty, prejudice, and a lack of access to excellent education can limit the possibilities available to an individual and affect their socialization experience in ways that can have a detrimental impact on the life outcomes of that individual. In this setting, the concept of meritocracy, which refers to the idea that people ought to be rewarded according to the abilities and efforts they put forth, can be challenging to implement. It is important to recognize that structural factors and historical discrimination can create barriers to opportunity for certain groups of people, making it difficult for them to succeed based on their abilities and effort alone. While the concept of meritocracy is frequently praised, it is important to acknowledge that such barriers can be created. Because of this, it is possible that it is more appropriate to argue that meritocracy is either a fiction or an ideal that is difficult to fully accomplish in practice.
