Education and schooling play a crucial part in the process of socializing people into society by teaching them the standards, values, and beliefs of the culture in which they are raised. This process has the potential to affect the beliefs, attitudes, and behaviors of an individual, as well as the results of their lives. The process of socialization that takes place through education can also contribute to the perpetuation of societal inequalities. This is because certain groups of people may have less access to quality education, and as a result, they may be at a disadvantage in terms of the opportunities and the outcomes of their lives. In a society where structural factors such as race, class, and gender shape an individual's access to education and opportunities, the concept of meritocracy, which states that individuals should be judged and rewarded based on their abilities and effort, may be a myth. Meritocracy is the idea that individuals should be judged and rewarded based on their abilities and effort. These characteristics can make it more difficult for individuals to attain success based only on their own merit, and success may instead be moulded by forces that are beyond the control of a person. Nevertheless, it is feasible to aim for a meritocracy by making deliberate efforts to address and minimize the structural inequities that exist in society and the education system.
