In addition to equipping students with the information and skills they'll need to engage in the workforce and other elements of society, formal education and schooling play a vital role in socializing people into society by teaching them the norms, values, and beliefs of their culture. An individual's socialization experience shapes and influences their life outcomes by providing them with the opportunity to acquire the knowledge, skills, and values necessary for success in their chosen field and by assisting them in developing the social networks and relationships that can be important to achieving their goals. However, poverty, prejudice, and a lack of access to excellent education are all structural variables that may restrict an individual's options and affect their socialization experience in ways that can have a detrimental effect on life outcomes. In such a setting, meritocracy, the principle that people should be rewarded for their efforts rather than their position, may be challenging to implement. While meritocracy is generally held up as the ideal, it is crucial to realize that some groups of individuals may find it difficult to achieve solely on their ability and effort alone due to structural impediments and past prejudice. Because of this, it may be more correct to call meritocracy an ideal or a fiction.
