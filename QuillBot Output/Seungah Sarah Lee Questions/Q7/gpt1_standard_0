By introducing people to the norms, values, beliefs, and customs of their culture as well as the abilities and knowledge required to survive in that society, education and schooling can help people integrate into society. By determining an individual's opportunities and resources, this process can shape and influence their life outcomes. It's crucial to remember that socialization is influenced by a variety of factors, including family, community, and culture, in addition to education and schooling. In addition, structural factors and the ways that people are socialized and assigned through education frequently contribute to the continuation of existing inequalities, including those based on race, class, and gender. The notion of meritocracy holds that people should be rewarded for their skills and efforts rather than their social backgrounds. Meritocracy, however, is frequently debunked as a myth because structural issues can restrict the opportunities and resources available to members of marginalized groups, making it difficult for them to succeed solely on the basis of their own merits. Overall, socialization is intricate and multifaceted, and a variety of factors, such as structural injustices, mold and have an impact on how an individual's life turns out. Although the idea of meritocracy may be appealing, it is crucial to acknowledge and deal with the ways in which structural factors may restrict resources and opportunities for marginalized groups.
