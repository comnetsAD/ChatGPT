The educational and scholastic experiences of individuals play a crucial role in integrating them into society by instilling in them the values, beliefs, and customs of the dominant culture. A person's thoughts, feelings, and actions can all be influenced by this procedure. Because some groups of people may have less access to quality education, they may be at a disadvantage in terms of opportunities and life outcomes, and this can be reinforced by the socialization process. In a society where structural factors like race, class, and gender shape an individual's access to education and opportunities, the idea that individuals should be judged and rewarded based on their abilities and effort may be a myth. These factors may be beyond the control of individuals and limit their ability to succeed on the basis of their own merit alone. Nonetheless, a meritocracy can be achieved through efforts to address and reduce structural inequalities in society and the education system.
