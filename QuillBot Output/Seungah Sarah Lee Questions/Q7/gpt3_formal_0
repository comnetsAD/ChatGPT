Education and schooling play a significant role in socializing individuals into society by teaching them the cultural norms, values, and beliefs. This process can influence a person's beliefs, attitudes, and actions, as well as their life outcomes. Socialization through education can also perpetuate societal inequalities, as certain groups may have less access to quality education and therefore be at a disadvantage in terms of life outcomes and opportunities. In a society where structural factors such as race, class, and gender influence access to education and opportunities, meritocracy may be a myth. These factors can impede an individual's ability to achieve success solely on the basis of his or her merit, and may instead be shaped by factors beyond his or her control. However, a meritocracy can be achieved by actively addressing and reducing structural inequalities in society and the education system.
