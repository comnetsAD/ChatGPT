Education and schooling can socialize people into society by teaching them the norms, values, beliefs, and customs of their culture and the skills and knowledge needed to function in that society. This process affects a person's life by determining their opportunities and resources. However, education, schooling, family, community, and culture all influence socialization. Education can also perpetuate race, class, and gender inequalities due to structural factors and how people are socialized and allocated. Meritocracy holds that people should be rewarded for their skills and effort, not their social status. However, structural factors can limit opportunities and resources for marginalized groups, making meritocracy a myth. Socialization is complicated, and structural inequalities affect life outcomes. Meritocracy is good, but structural factors can limit opportunities and resources for marginalized groups.
