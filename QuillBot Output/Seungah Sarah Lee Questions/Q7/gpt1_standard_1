By introducing people to the norms, values, beliefs, and rituals of their culture as well as the abilities and information required to survive in that society, education and schooling can help people integrate into society. By determining an individual's possibilities and resources, this process can shape and impact their life outcomes. It's crucial to remember that socialization is influenced by a variety of elements, including family, community, and culture, in addition to education and schooling. In addition, institutional factors and the ways that people are socialized and assigned through education frequently contribute to the continuation of existing disparities, including those based on race, class, and gender. The notion of meritocracy holds that people should be rewarded for their skills and achievements rather than their social backgrounds. Meritocracy, however, is frequently debunked as a fallacy since structural issues can restrict the chances and resources accessible to members of marginalized groups, making it harder for them to succeed solely on the basis of their own merits. Overall, socialization is intricate and multifaceted, and a variety of circumstances, such as structural injustices, mold and have an impact on how an individual's life turns out. Although the idea of meritocracy may be appealing, it is crucial to acknowledge and deal with the ways in which structural issues may restrict resources and opportunities for underrepresented groups.
