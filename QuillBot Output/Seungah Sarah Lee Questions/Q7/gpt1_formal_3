Education and education may socialize people into society by teaching them the cultural norms, values, beliefs, and rituals, as well as the skills and information required to participate in that community. This process may shape and affect the life outcomes of a person by influencing their access to opportunities and resources. It is crucial to emphasize, however, that socialization is affected not just by education and schooling, but also by family, community, and culture. Inequalities, such as those based on race, class, and gender, are often perpetuated by structural factors and the manner in which people are socialized and assigned via schooling. Meritocracy is the notion that people should be rewarded based on their talents and achievements, as opposed to their social origins. However, it is sometimes maintained that meritocracy is a fiction since structural barriers may restrict the opportunities and resources accessible to people from underprivileged groups, making it harder for them to attain success solely on the basis of their merit. In general, socialization is complicated and varied, and different influences, including structural inequities, shape and impact the life outcomes of a person. While meritocracy might be a desirable notion, it is essential to identify and address the ways in which structural barriers can restrict the opportunities and resources available to underprivileged groups.
