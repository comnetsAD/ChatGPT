Education and schooling play an important role in socializing individuals into society by teaching them cultural norms, values, and beliefs, as well as equipping them with the knowledge and skills necessary to participate in the labor and other sectors of society. The socialization experience shapes and influences an individual's life outcomes by allowing them to acquire the knowledge, skills, and values required to succeed in their chosen field and by assisting them in developing the social networks and relationships that can be important in achieving their goals. However, structural constraints such as poverty, prejudice, and a lack of access to a high-quality education can limit an individual's chances and affect their socialization experience in ways that can have a detrimental impact on their life outcomes. Meritocracy, the notion that individuals should be rewarded based on their abilities and effort, might be difficult to achieve in this situation. While the ideal of meritocracy is frequently extolled, it is critical to acknowledge that structural constraints and historical prejudice can create hurdles to opportunity for particular groups of individuals, making it impossible for them to succeed solely on the basis of their ability and effort. As a result, it might be more realistic to describe meritocracy as a myth or an ideal that is difficult to fully realize in practice.
