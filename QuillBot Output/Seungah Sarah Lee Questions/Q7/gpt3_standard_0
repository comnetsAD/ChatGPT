By introducing people to the customs, beliefs, and values of the society they live in, education and schooling are crucial in integrating people into society. A person's beliefs, attitudes, and behavior may be shaped by this process, which may also have an impact on how their life turns out. Because some groups of people may have less access to high-quality education and are consequently at a disadvantage in terms of opportunities and life outcomes, socialization through education can also serve to maintain societal inequalities. In a society where structural factors like race, class, and gender shape an individual's access to education and opportunities, the concept of meritocracy—the notion that people should be evaluated and rewarded based on their abilities and effort—might be a myth. These factors may not be within an individual's control and may instead limit their ability to succeed on the basis of their own merits. But if you actively work to address and lessen structural inequalities in society and the educational system, you can strive for a meritocracy.
