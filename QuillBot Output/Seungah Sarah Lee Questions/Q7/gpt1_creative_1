Individuals can be socialized into society through their educational and scholastic experiences, where they are taught the standards, values, beliefs, and customs of their culture, as well as the skills and information necessary to participate fully in that community. A person's life outcomes can be affected by this procedure since it determines their access to resources and the possibilities available to them. It's true that formal schooling has a significant role in shaping people's socialization, but other influences, such as those from one's family, neighborhood, and culture, also play a role. Additionally, existing inequalities, such as those based on race, class, and gender, can frequently be perpetuated by the structural elements and ways in which individuals become socialized and allocated through education. The concept of meritocracy refers to an economic and political system in which people rise through the ranks based on their own merits rather than their family's wealth or social status. It is maintained, however, that meritocracy is a fallacy because people from underrepresented groups often lack access to the resources necessary to succeed based on their own abilities. Overarchingly, socialization is intricate and multi-faceted, and many factors, including structural inequities, shape and impact an individual's life outcomes. While meritocracy is an appealing idea, it is critical to address the ways in which structural barriers might restrict access to resources and opportunities for underrepresented groups.
