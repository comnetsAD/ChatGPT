Education and schooling socialize people into society by teaching them their culture's norms, values, and beliefs and giving them the skills they need to work and participate in society. However, structural factors like poverty, discrimination, and poor education can limit an individual's opportunities and shape their socialization experience, which can negatively impact their life outcomes. Meritocracy—the belief that people should be rewarded for their skills and effort—can be hard to achieve in this context. While meritocracy is often touted, structural factors and historical discrimination can create barriers to opportunity for certain groups, making it hard for them to succeed on their own merits. Thus, meritocracy may be a myth or ideal that is hard to achieve.
