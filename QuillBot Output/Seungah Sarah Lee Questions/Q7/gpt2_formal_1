Education and schooling play an important role in socializing individuals into society by teaching them the norms, values, and beliefs of their culture and equipping them with the knowledge and skills necessary to participate in the workforce and other sectors of society. The socialization experience shapes and influences an individual's life outcomes by providing them with the opportunity to acquire the knowledge, skills, and values required for success in their chosen field and by assisting them in developing the social networks and relationships that can be crucial to achieving their objectives. However, structural constraints such as poverty, prejudice, and lack of access to a quality education can limit a person's opportunities and affect their socialization experience in ways that have a detrimental impact on their life outcomes. Meritocracy, the notion that individuals should be rewarded based on their abilities and effort, might be difficult to achieve in this situation. It is crucial to understand that institutional circumstances and historical discrimination can create hurdles to opportunity for particular groups of people, making it harder for them to succeed solely on the basis of their abilities and efforts. Consequently, it may be more realistic to refer to meritocracy as a fiction or an ideal that is difficult to fully realize in actuality.
