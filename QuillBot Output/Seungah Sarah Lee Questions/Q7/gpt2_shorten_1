Education and education socialize people into society by teaching them their culture's norms, values, and beliefs and giving them the skills they need to work and participate in society. Socialization helps people learn the information, abilities, and values they need to succeed in their career and build the social networks and relationships they need to achieve their goals. However, structural problems like poverty, prejudice, and poor education can limit an individual's possibilities and alter their socialization experience, which can severely impact their life outcomes. Meritocracy—the concept that people should be rewarded for their skills and effort—can be hard to achieve in this situation. While meritocracy is sometimes praised, structural issues and historical discrimination can create barriers to opportunity for particular groups, making it hard for them to achieve on their own merits. Thus, meritocracy may be a myth or ideal that is hard to realize.
