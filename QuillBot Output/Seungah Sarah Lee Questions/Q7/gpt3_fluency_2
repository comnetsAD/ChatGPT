Individuals are socialized into society through education and schooling, which teaches them the norms, values, and beliefs of the culture in which they live. This process has the potential to affect an individual's ideas, attitudes, and conduct, as well as influence their life results. Socialization via education may also perpetuate social disparities, since certain groups of individuals may have less access to excellent education and hence face less possibilities and life outcomes. Meritocracy, the belief that people should be assessed and rewarded based on their talents and efforts, may be a fiction in a society where structural variables like race, class, and gender impact people's access to education and opportunity. These characteristics can limit an individual's capacity to attain success solely on merit, and may be impacted by forces outside an individual's control. However, it is feasible to move toward a meritocracy by actively addressing and reducing structural disparities in society and the educational system.
