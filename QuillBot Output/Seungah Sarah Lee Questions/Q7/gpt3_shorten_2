Schooling instills the values, customs, and beliefs of a culture and socializes people. This process can impact a person's ideas, attitudes, and behavior and life consequences. Education may also perpetuate societal disparities since certain groups have less access to excellent education and hence less chances and life outcomes. In a culture where race, class, and gender determine an individual's access to education and opportunity, meritocracy may be a fallacy. These circumstances may prevent someone from succeeding solely on merit alone. By addressing structural inequities in society and education, meritocracy may be achieved.
