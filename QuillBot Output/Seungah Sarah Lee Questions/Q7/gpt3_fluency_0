Individuals are socialized into society through education and schooling, which teaches them the norms, values, and beliefs of the culture in which they live. This process has the potential to shape an individual's beliefs, attitudes, and behavior, as well as influence their life outcomes. Socialization through education can also perpetuate societal inequalities, as certain groups of people may have less access to quality education and thus face fewer opportunities and life outcomes. Meritocracy, the idea that people should be judged and rewarded based on their abilities and efforts, may be a myth in a society where structural factors like race, class, and gender shape people's access to education and opportunities. These factors can limit an individual's ability to achieve success solely on merit, and may be shaped by factors beyond an individual's control. However, it is possible to work toward a meritocracy by actively addressing and reducing structural inequalities in society and the educational system.
