The educational and scholastic experiences of people play a crucial part in integrating them into society by instilling in them the values, beliefs, and customs of the dominant culture. A person's thoughts, feelings, and actions may all be influenced by this procedure. Because certain groups of individuals may have less access to excellent education, they may be at a disadvantage in terms of opportunities and life outcomes, and this may be reinforced through the socialization process. In a culture where structural variables like race, class, and gender impact an individual's access to education and opportunities, the concept that people should be assessed and rewarded solely on their ability and effort may be a fiction. These circumstances may be beyond the control of people and hinder their potential to succeed on the basis of their own talent alone. Nonetheless, a meritocracy may be achieved by efforts to address and remove structural disparities in society and the education system.
