In addition to teaching people the customs, beliefs, and values of their culture, education and schooling also equips them with the information and abilities necessary to engage in the workforce and other facets of society. By giving someone the chance to learn the knowledge, skills, and values necessary to succeed in their chosen field and by assisting them in developing the social networks and relationships that can be crucial for achieving their goals, the socialization experience shapes and influences an individual's life outcomes. However, structural constraints like poverty, prejudice, and a lack of access to high-quality education can restrict a person's prospects and affect how they socialize in ways that can have a detrimental effect on their results in life. Meritocracy—the idea that people should be rewarded for their efforts and abilities—can be challenging to implement in this situation. The notion of a meritocracy is frequently praised, but it is vital to understand that hurdles to opportunity can be created for some groups of individuals due to structural constraints and past prejudice, making it harder for them to achieve based only on their skills and effort. It could thus be more realistic to describe meritocracy as a myth or as an ideal that is challenging to completely realize in reality.
