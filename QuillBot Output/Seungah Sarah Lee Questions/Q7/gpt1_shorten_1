Education and schooling can socialize people into society by teaching them the norms, values, beliefs, and customs of their culture and the skills and information needed to participate in that community. This process affects a person's life by deciding their possibilities and resources. However, education, schooling, family, society, and culture all influence socialization. Education can also perpetuate race, class, and gender inequities due to structural reasons and how people are socialized and allocated. Meritocracy holds that people should be rewarded for their skills and effort, not their social status. However, institutional issues can limit opportunities and resources for underprivileged populations, making meritocracy a mirage. Socialization is complicated, and structural inequities affect life outcomes. Meritocracy is good, but structural issues can limit opportunities and resources for underprivileged populations.
