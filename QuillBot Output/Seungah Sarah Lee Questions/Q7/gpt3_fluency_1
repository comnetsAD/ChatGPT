Individuals are socialized into society through education and schooling, which teaches them the norms, values, and beliefs of the culture in which they live. This process has the potential to affect an individual's ideas, attitudes, and conduct, as well as influence their life results. Socialization through education can also perpetuate societal disparities, since certain groups of individuals may have less access to quality education and thus face less possibilities and life outcomes. Meritocracy, the belief that people should be judged and rewarded based on their abilities and efforts, may be a fiction in a society where structural variables like race, class, and gender impact people's access to education and opportunity. These characteristics can limit an individual's capacity to attain success solely on merit, and may be impacted by forces outside an individual's control. However, it is possible to move toward a meritocracy by actively addressing and reducing structural disparities in society and the educational system.
