Schooling instills the values, norms, and beliefs of a culture and socializes people. This process can influence a person's beliefs, attitudes, and behavior and life outcomes. Education can also perpetuate societal inequalities because some groups have less access to quality education and therefore fewer opportunities and life outcomes. In a society where race, class, and gender determine an individual's access to education and opportunities, meritocracy may be a myth. These factors may prevent people from succeeding based on merit alone. By addressing structural inequalities in society and education, meritocracy can be achieved.
