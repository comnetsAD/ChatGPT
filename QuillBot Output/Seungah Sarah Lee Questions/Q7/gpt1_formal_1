Education and schooling can socialize individuals into society by teaching them the cultural norms, values, beliefs, and rituals, as well as the skills and information required to participate in that community. This process can shape and affect the life outcomes of an individual by determining their access to opportunities and resources. It is crucial to emphasize, however, that socialization is determined not only by education and schooling, but also by family, community, and culture. Inequalities, such as those based on race, class, and gender, are frequently perpetuated by structural factors and the manner in which individuals are socialized and assigned through education. Meritocracy is the notion that people should be rewarded based on their abilities and achievements, as opposed to their social backgrounds. However, it is sometimes maintained that meritocracy is a fiction since structural barriers can limit the opportunities and resources accessible to individuals from underprivileged groups, making it harder for them to attain success solely on the basis of their merit. In general, socialization is complicated and varied, and different influences, including structural inequities, shape and impact the life outcomes of an individual. While meritocracy might be a desirable notion, it is essential to identify and address the ways in which structural barriers can limit the opportunities and resources available to underprivileged groups.
