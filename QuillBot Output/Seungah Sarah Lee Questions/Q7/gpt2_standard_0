In addition to teaching people the customs, beliefs, and values of their culture, education and schooling also equips people with the knowledge and abilities necessary to participate in the workforce and other facets of society. By giving someone the chance to learn the knowledge, skills, and values necessary to succeed in their chosen field and by assisting them in developing the social networks and relationships that can be crucial for achieving their goals, the socialization experience shapes and influences an individual's life outcomes. However, structural factors like poverty, discrimination, and a lack of access to high-quality education can restrict a person's opportunities and affect how they socialize in ways that can have a detrimental effect on their outcomes in life. Meritocracy—the idea that people should be rewarded for their efforts and abilities—can be challenging to implement in this situation. The idea of a meritocracy is frequently praised, but it is important to understand that barriers to opportunity can be created for some groups of people due to structural factors and historical discrimination, making it difficult for them to succeed based solely on their skills and effort. It might therefore be more accurate to describe meritocracy as a myth or as an ideal that is challenging to fully realize in reality.
