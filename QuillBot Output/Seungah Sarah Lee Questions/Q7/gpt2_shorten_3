Education and education socialize people into society by teaching them their culture's norms, values, and beliefs and giving them the skills they need to work and participate in society. Socialization helps people learn the information, abilities, and values they need to succeed in their career and build the social networks and connections they need to achieve their objectives. However, structural problems like poverty, prejudice, and poor education may restrict an individual's possibilities and alter their socialization experience, which can severely effect their life outcomes. Meritocracy—the concept that people should be rewarded for their skills and effort—can be hard to implement in this situation. While meritocracy is sometimes praised, structural issues and historical prejudice may create hurdles to opportunity for particular groups, making it hard for them to achieve on their own merits. Thus, meritocracy may be a fiction or ideal that is hard to realize.
