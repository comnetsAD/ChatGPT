The assertion is correct. This proposition may be proven by demonstrating that there are positive constants c and n0 such that for any n > n0, 2f(n) = c * 2g (n). Assume that f(n) is O(g(n)), which means that there are positive constants c1 and n1 such that for any n > n1, f(n) = c1 * g. (n). As a result, for any n > n1, 2f(n) = 2 * c1 * g(n). Let c = 2 * c1, and n0 = n1, then 2f(n) = c * 2g(n) for all n > n0, implying that 2f(n) is O(2g(n)). It is vital to remember that the big O notation compares the pace of development of two functions rather than their actual values, therefore this statement is correct.
