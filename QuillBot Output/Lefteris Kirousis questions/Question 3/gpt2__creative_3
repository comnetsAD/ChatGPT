This is a correct statement. We may demonstrate this by proving that for any n > n0, 2f(n) = c * 2g, and that these constants are positive (n). To illustrate, let's pretend that f(n) is O(g(n)), which means that there are positive constants c1 and n1 such that, for every n > n1, f(n) = c1 * g. (n). Therefore, for any n > n1, 2f(n) = 2 * c1 * g(n). Since 2f(n) is O(2g(n)) for all n > n0, we may write c = 2 * c1 and n0 = n1 to get 2f(n) = c * 2g(n). In other words, this is valid because the big O notation is used to compare the relative rates of growth of two functions rather than their absolute values.
