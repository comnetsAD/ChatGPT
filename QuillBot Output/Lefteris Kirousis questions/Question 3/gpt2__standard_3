The assertion is accurate. We may demonstrate this claim by demonstrating the existence of positive constants c and n0 such that 2f(n) = c * 2g for every n > n0 (n). Assume that f(n) is O(g(n)), which indicates that there are positive constants c1 and n1 such that f(n) = c1 * g for every n > n1 (n). As a result, for any n > n1, 2f(n) = 2 * c1 * g(n). Now that c = 2 * c1 and n0 = n1 have been established, 2f(n) is O(2g(n)) since it = c * 2g(n) for every n > n0. This assertion is accurate since the big O notation is a tool that compares the pace of growth of two functions rather than their precise values.
