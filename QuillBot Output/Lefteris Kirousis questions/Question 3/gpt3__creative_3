This is a correct statement. Given that f(n) is O(g(n)), we can show that for any n > n1, f(n) = c1 * g, hence the assertion must be true (n). For any n > n1, this means that 2f(n) = 2c1 * g(n). By setting c= 2c1 and n0 = n1, we get that 2f(n) equals O(2g(n)). In other words, this is valid because the big O notation is used to compare the relative rates of growth of two functions rather than their absolute values. The rate of increase of a function is unaffected by multiplication or division by a constant.
