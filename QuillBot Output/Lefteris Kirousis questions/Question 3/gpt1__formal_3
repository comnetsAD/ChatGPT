The assertion is accurate. To demonstrate this, we may suppose that f(n) is O(g(n)), which means that there exist constants c1 and n1 such that for any n > n1, f(n) = c1 * g. (n). Therefore, 2f(n) <= 2c1 * g(n) for every n > n1 So, we may conclude that 2f(n) is O(2g(n)) if we replace c with 2c1 and n0 with n1 It is important to note that this assertion holds regardless of the logarithm's base. The reason for this is that the O notation is used to compare the rate of growth of two functions, and multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a constant has no effect on the rate of growth.
