This is a correct assertion. This assertion may be shown by demonstrating that there are positive constants c and n0 such that for any n that are greater than n0, 2f(n) is equal to c * 2g (n). Assume that f(n) is an operator, which means that there are positive constants c1 and n1 such that, for any n that is greater than n1, f(n) is less than or equal to c1 * g. (n). Since n is greater than n1, it follows that 2f(n) is less than or equal to 2 times c1 times g(n). If we assume that c = 2 * c1, and that n0 = n1, then we get that 2f(n) = c * 2g(n) for any n that are greater than n0. This indicates that 2f(n) is equivalent to O(2g(n)). As a result of the fact that the big O notation is a tool that compares the pace of growth of two functions rather than their precise values, the preceding statement is accurate. It is vital to keep in mind that the big O notation is a tool.
