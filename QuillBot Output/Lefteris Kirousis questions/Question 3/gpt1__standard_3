The assertion is accurate. We may suppose that f(n) is O(g(n)), which means that there are positive constants c1 and n1 such that for every n > n1, f(n) = c1 * g, in order to demonstrate this claim (n). As a result, for any n > n1, 2f(n) = 2c1 * g(n). By using c= 2c1 and n0 = n1, we may conclude that 2f(n) equals O(2g(n)). It is important to note that this assertion is true regardless of the logarithm base that is used. For this reason, multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a constant has no effect on the rate of growth because the O notation is used to compare the growth rates of two functions.
