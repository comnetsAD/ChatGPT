This is a correct assertion. In order to demonstrate that this assertion is true, we need only suppose that f(n) is O(g(n)), which indicates that there are positive constants c1 and n1 such that, for any n that is greater than n1, f(n) is less than or equal to c1 * g. (n). Therefore, 2f(n) <= 2c1 * g(n) for every n > n1 Therefore, if we choose c = 2c1 and n0 = n1, we may deduce that 2f(n) is equivalent to O(2g(n)). It is important to emphasize that the validity of this assertion is unaffected by the choice of base for the logarithm being applied. The explanation for this is because the O notation is used in the process of contrasting the rates of expansion of two functions, and multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a constant does not affect the rate of expansion in any way.
