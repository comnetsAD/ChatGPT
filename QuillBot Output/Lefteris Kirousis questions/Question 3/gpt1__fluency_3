The assertion is correct. To demonstrate this point, let us suppose that f(n) is O(g(n)), which means that there exist positive constants c1 and n1 such that for any n > n1, f(n) = c1 * g. (n). As a result, 2f(n) = 2c1 * g(n) for every n > n1. So, by choosing c= 2c1 and n0 = n1, we can argue that 2f(n) equals O(2g(n)). It is worth noting that this assertion is true regardless of the logarithm base utilized. Because the O notation is used to compare the rate of growth of two functions, multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a constant has no effect on the rate of growth.
