This is a correct statement. Given that f(n) is O(g(n)), we can show that for any n > n1, f(n) = c1 * g, hence the assertion must be true (n). So, for any n >= n1, 2f(n) = 2c1 * g(n). By setting c= 2c1 and n0 = n1, we get that 2f(n) equals O(2g(n)). It's important to note that this assertion holds true in any base of logarithm. The rate of growth does not change when multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a constant, which is why the O notation is used to compare the rates of growth of two functions.
