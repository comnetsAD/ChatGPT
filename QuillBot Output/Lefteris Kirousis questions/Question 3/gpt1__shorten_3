True. To verify this, we may suppose that f(n) is O(g(n)), meaning there exist positive constants c1 and n1 such that for any n > n1, f(n) <= c1 * g. (n). For every n > n1, 2f(n) <= 2c1 * g(n). 2f(n) is O(2g(n)) if c = 2c1 and n0 = n1. This assertion holds independent of logarithm base. The O notation compares the rate of development of two functions, thus multiplying or dividing both sides of an inequality by a constant does not affect it.
