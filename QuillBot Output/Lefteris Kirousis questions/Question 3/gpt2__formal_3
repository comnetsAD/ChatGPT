The assertion is accurate. This assertion may be proven by demonstrating that there are positive constants c and n0 such that for any n > n0, 2f(n) = c * 2g (n). Assume f(n) is O(g(n)), which means there exist constants c1 and n1 such that for any n > n1, f(n) = c1 * g. (n). Consequently, 2f(n) = 2 * c1 * g(n) for any n > n1. If c = 2 * c1 and n0 = n1, then 2f(n) = c * 2g(n) for all n > n0, indicating that 2f(n) is O(2g(n)). Noting that the big O notation compares the pace of development of two functions rather than their precise values, this assertion is correct.
