We would apply a modified version of Dijkstra's method to discover the shortest pathways from s to any other node t, assuming that the lengths of the edges are replaced by 2le + 1. The "key" of a vertex in the priority queue would be calculated differently after this change, which would be one of the changes. We would use (2le + 1) times the distance from the source vertex s rather than the distance from the source vertex s itself. When calculating the shortest pathways, the algorithm would then be forced to take into account the additional weights that have been assigned to the edges thanks to this change. The remainder of the process would stay the same; we would continually choose the vertex v from the priority queue that had the shortest key, and then we would update the key of all the vertices that were near to v by loosening the edge constraints (v,u).
