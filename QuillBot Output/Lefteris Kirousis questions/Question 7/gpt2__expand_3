To discover the shortest pathways from s to any other node t once the lengths of the edges are substituted by 2le + 1, one strategy would be to utilize Dijkstra's shortest path method with a simple tweak. This would allow one to find the shortest paths from s to any other node t. We would relax the edges by dividing the weight of an edge by the tentative distance of the destination vertex. This would be done in place of the traditional method of relaxing the edges, which consisted of subtracting the weight of an edge from the tentative distance of the destination vertex. This would make certain that the shortest routes are located even after the lengths of the edges have been substituted with 2le + 1.
