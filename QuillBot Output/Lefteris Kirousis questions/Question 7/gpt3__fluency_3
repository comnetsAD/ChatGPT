The modified Dijkstra's method might be used to determine the shortest pathways from s to any other node t when the lengths of the edges are changed by 2le + 1. The core concept is the same as in the original Dijkstra's algorithm, but with a minor change in the relaxation stage. Instead of relaxing the edges by updating the distance of a vertex as the sum of the previous vertex's distance and the edge's weight, we would update the distance as the sum of the previous vertex's distance and (2le + 1) of the edge's weight. The priority queue, implemented as a min-heap data structure, would then be used to maintain track of the vertex with the least distance from the source vertex s. The method continually picks the vertex v with the least distance from the priority queue and updates the distance of all vertices close to v by relaxing the edge (v,u). After processing all vertices, the algorithm will have calculated the shortest routes from s to every other vertices in the network, taking into account the new weights (2le + 1).
