The modified Dijkstra's method may be used to determine the shortest routes from any node s to any other node t when the edge lengths are replaced by 2le + 1. Although the relaxation stage has been somewhat altered, the fundamental concept of the original Dijkstra's method remains the same. We would update the distance of a vertex as the sum of the distance of the previous vertex and (2le + 1) of the weight of the edge rather than relaxing the edges by updating the distance as the sum of the previous vertex's distance and the weight of the edge. The vertex that is closest to the source vertex s would then be tracked using a priority queue, implemented as a min-heap data structure. The method continually chooses the vertex v from the priority queue with the least distance, and by relaxing the edge, it updates the distances of all other vertices nearby to v. (v,u). The algorithm will have found the shortest routes between s and every other vertex in the network after processing all of the vertices and taking into account the new weights (2le + 1).
