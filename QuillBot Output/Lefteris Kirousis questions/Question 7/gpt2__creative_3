After the lengths of the edges are replaced by 2le + 1, one way to discover the shortest pathways from s to any other node t is to use a slightly modified version of Dijkstra's shortest path method. We could loosen the edges by dividing the weight of an edge by the distance to the final vertex in instead of just removing the weight of the edge from the tentative distance. After the edge lengths are changed by 2le + 1, this would still result in the shortest pathways being discovered.
