One method would be to utilize Dijkstra's shortest route algorithm with a little change to determine the pathways that are the shortest from node s to any other node t after the lengths of the edges have been substituted by 2le + 1. As opposed to relaxing the edges by dividing the weight of an edge by the destination vertex's tentative distance, we would instead relax the edges by dividing the weight of an edge by the destination vertex's tentative distance. This would guarantee that the shortest pathways are discovered even after the edge lengths have been changed to 2le + 1.
