The modified Dijkstra's method might be used to determine the shortest pathways from s to any other node t when the lengths of the edges are substituted by 2le + 1. The fundamental concept is identical to the original Dijkstra's method, however the relaxation phase has been modified somewhat. Instead of relaxing the edges by updating the distance of a vertex as the sum of the distance of the previous vertex and the edge's weight, the distance would be updated as the sum of the distance of the previous vertex and (2le + 1) of the edge's weight. Then, we would design a priority queue as a min-heap data structure to keep track of the vertex with the shortest distance from the source vertex s. The method continually picks the vertex with the shortest distance from the priority queue and updates the distances of all nearby vertices by relaxing the edge (v,u). Once all vertices have been analyzed, the algorithm will compute the shortest routes from s to every other vertex in the graph, taking into account the new weights (2le + 1).
