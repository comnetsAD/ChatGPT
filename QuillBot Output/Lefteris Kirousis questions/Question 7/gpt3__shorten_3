The updated Dijkstra's method can identify the shortest pathways from s to t when the edge lengths are changed by 2le + 1. With a little relaxation step change, Dijkstra's method is the same. Instead of relaxing edges by updating a vertex's distance as the sum of the previous vertex's distance and the edge's weight, we would update it as the sum of the previous vertex's distance and ( 2le + 1) of the edge's weight. Then we would utilize a priority queue, implemented as a min-heap data structure, to monitor the vertex closest to s. The method continually picks the vertex v from the priority queue with the least distance and updates the distance of all nearby vertices by relaxing the edge (v,u). The algorithm will calculate the shortest routes from s to all other vertices in the network using the updated weights (2le + 1).
