When the lengths of the edges are changed to 2le + 1, the updated Dijkstra's method may be used to determine the shortest pathways from node s to any other node t. The core concept is the same as in Dijkstra's original method, however the relaxation phase has been tweaked somewhat. Instead of updating the distance between two vertices by adding the distance between them and the weight of an edge to relax the graph, we might update the distance between vertices by adding the distance between them and (2le + 1) of the weight of the edge. Then, the vertex closest to the source vertex s would be kept in mind using a priority queue, which would be realized as a min-heap data structure. Over and over, the algorithm picks the closest vertex from the priority queue, v, and relaxes the edges connecting all the vertices to v, bringing their distances closer together (v,u). Shortest routes from s to all other vertices in the network will be calculated using the updated weights (2le + 1) after all vertices have been evaluated by the algorithm.
