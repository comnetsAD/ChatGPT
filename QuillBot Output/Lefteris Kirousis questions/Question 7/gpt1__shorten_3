Dijkstra's method is modified to discover the shortest pathways from s to any other node t, assuming edge lengths are 2le + 1. The priority queue vertex "key" calculation would change. We would use (2le + 1) times the distance from the source vertex s. This ensures that the algorithm considers the updated edge weights when calculating shortest pathways. The method would continue to choose the vertex v from the priority queue with the least key and update the keys of all neighboring vertices by relaxing the edge (v,u).
