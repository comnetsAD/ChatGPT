To determine the shortest pathways from node s to any other node t when the lengths of the edges have been substituted by 2le + 1, one option would be to modify Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm. Instead of relaxing the edges by subtracting the weight of an edge from the tentative distance of the destination vertex, we would divide the weight of an edge by that distance. This would guarantee that the shortest pathways are discovered even when the lengths of the edges are substituted by 2le + 1.
