One way would be to utilize Dijkstra's shortest route algorithm with a simple change to discover the shortest paths from s to any other node t after the lengths of the edges are substituted by 2le + 1. We would relax the edges by dividing the weight of an edge by the tentative distance of the destination vertex rather than subtracting the weight of an edge from the tentative distance of the destination vertex. This ensures that the shortest pathways are identified even after the edge lengths have been changed with 2le + 1.
