When the lengths of the edges are replaced by 2le + 1, we may apply a variant of Dijkstra's method to determine the shortest pathways from node s to any other node t. The change would be made to the formula used to determine a vertex's "key" in the priority queue. You may think of it as (2le + 1) times the distance from the source vertex s. This would guarantee the algorithm considers the updated edge weights when calculating the shortest pathways. As for the remainder of the method, it wouldn't change a thing; we'd keep picking the vertex with the least key from the priority queue, and then loosening the edge constraints on all the vertices close to v so that their keys would get smaller (v,u).
