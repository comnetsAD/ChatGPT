We would apply a modified version of Dijkstra's method to determine the shortest pathways from node s to any other node t, assuming that the lengths of the edges are replaced by 2le + 1. Changes would be made to the method by which we determine the "key" of a vertex in the priority queue. Instead of utilizing the distance from the source vertex s, we would multiply it by (2le + 1). This would guarantee that the algorithm considers the updated edge weights when calculating the shortest pathways. The remainder of the method would stay unchanged; we would continually choose the vertex v with the least key from the priority queue and update the keys of all neighboring vertices by relaxing the edges (v,u).
