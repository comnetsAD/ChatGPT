To discover the shortest pathways from s to any other node t, we would apply a modified version of Dijkstra's method, assuming the edge lengths are changed by 2le + 1. The change would be in how we determine a vertex's "key" in the priority queue. We would use (2le + 1) times the distance from the source vertex s instead of the distance from the source vertex s. This ensures that the algorithm considers the updated edge weights when computing the shortest pathways. The remainder of the process remains the same; we will continually choose the vertex v from the priority queue with the least key, and we will update the key of all vertices close to v by relaxing the edge (v,u).
