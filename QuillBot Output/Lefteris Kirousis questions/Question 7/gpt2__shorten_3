Dijkstra's shortest route method may be modified to determine the shortest pathways from s to any other node t once the edge lengths are substituted by 2le + 1. We would loosen the edges by dividing the weight of an edge by the tentative distance of the destination vertex instead of removing it. This would guarantee the shortest pathways even after replacing edge lengths by 2le + 1.
