The algorithm is described in the following way: Conduct a breadth-first search (BFS) using node s as the beginning point, and keep track of the distance that separates each node from s. This step takes time equal to O(m + n). Conduct a second BFS starting from node t1 and make a note of the distance between t1 and each node. This phase also requires O(m + n) amount of time to complete. Carry out a third BFS starting from the node t2 and make a note of the distance between each node and t2. This phase also requires O(m + n) amount of time to complete. Iterate through all of the nodes and choose the node u that is the only one that meets all of the following conditions: The amount of space between u and s is maximized to its fullest extent. It is impossible for the length of the route from s to t1 that includes u to be longer than the distance that separates s and t1. It is impossible for the length of the route that leads from s to t2 and includes u to be longer than the distance that separates s and t2. Please return the u node. The time required by the method is O(m + n), which is calculated by running three BFS, each of which requires O(m + n) time.
