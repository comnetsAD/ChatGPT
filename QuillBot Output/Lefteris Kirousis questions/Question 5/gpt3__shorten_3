Three breadth-first search (BFS) techniques can discover u. The first BFS method determines the shortest path from node s to t1. The second BFS method determines the shortest path from node s to t2. The third BFS method begins at node s and determines the largest distance from s while guaranteeing that the distances from s to t1 and t2 via u are not higher than those discovered in the first and second BFS algorithms. This method runs O(m) since BFS has a temporal complexity of O(m+n) and we execute it three times.
