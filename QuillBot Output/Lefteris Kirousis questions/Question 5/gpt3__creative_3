Three breadth-first search (BFS) techniques may be used to locate a node u that fits this description. In the first BFS method, we begin at node s and determine the shortest path from s to t1. In the second BFS method, we begin at node s and look for the shortest path to node t2. The third BFS method begins at node s and determines the largest distance from s while making sure that the lengths from s to t1 and s to t2 via the node u are not longer than the distances discovered by the first and second BFS algorithms. This method employs BFS, which has a time complexity of O(m+n), and we are executing it three times, therefore the total running time is O(m).
