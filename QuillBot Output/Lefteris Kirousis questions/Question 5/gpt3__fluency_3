Three breadth-first search (BFS) strategies may be used to discover such a node u. The first BFS algorithm begins at node s and seeks the shortest path from s to node t1. The second BFS method begins at node s and seeks the shortest path from s to node t2. The third BFS method begins at node s and determines the longest distance from s while guaranteeing that the distances from s to t1 and s to t2 through node u are not higher than the distances discovered by the first and second BFS algorithms. This method has an O(m) running time since it employs BFS, which has a time complexity of O(m+n) and is executed three times.
