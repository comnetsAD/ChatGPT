Using three breadth-first search (BFS) techniques is one approach to locate such a node u. The first BFS algorithm begins at node s and calculates the shortest path from s to t1. The second BFS algorithm begins at node s and determines the shortest path between s and t2. The third BFS method begins at node s and determines the longest distance from s while guaranteeing that the distances from s to t1 and s to t2 through node u are not larger than the corresponding distances determined by the first and second BFS algorithms. This algorithm's running time is O(m) as it employs BFS, which has a time complexity of O(m+n), and we are running it three times.
