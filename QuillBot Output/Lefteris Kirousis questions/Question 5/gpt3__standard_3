Three breadth-first search (BFS) strategies may be used to discover such a node u. Starting at node s, the first BFS algorithm determines the shortest path from s to t1. Starting at node s, the second BFS algorithm determines the shortest path from s to t2. The third BFS method begins at node s and calculates the largest distance from s while making sure that the distances from s to nodes t1 and t2 through node u are not longer than those calculated by the first and second BFS algorithms, respectively. This method employs BFS, which has an O(m+n) time complexity, and runs it three times, hence its running time is O(m).
