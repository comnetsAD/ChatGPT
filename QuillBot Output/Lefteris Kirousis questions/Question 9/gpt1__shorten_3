Divide-and-conquer can discover a local minimum of the whole binary tree T. Probe the tree's root first. Compare the root to its left and right offspring. Return the local minimum if the root value is smaller than both its children. If not, we repeat step 2 in the subtree where the root value exceeds the child value. Find a local minimum by repeating step 2. Since we only need to search the subtree with the local minimum, our strategy eliminates half the tree in each step. The local minimum can be found with log(n) probes since the tree is full and has height log(n). A local minimum in a four-level full binary tree requires at most four probes. First, we would investigate the root, then the left or right kid (whichever is smaller), then the left or right grandchild, and ultimately the left or right great-grandchild (which will be the local minimum if it exists).
