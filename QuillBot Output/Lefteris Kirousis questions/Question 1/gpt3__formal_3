The Stable Matching Problem with ties is referred to as the Stable Roommates Problem (SRP). It is well known that the SRP does not always have a solution devoid of significant instability. The following is an example of a collection of men and women with preference lists that has no perfect matching and no significant instability. Men: m1, m2, m3 Women: w1, w2, w3 m1: w1 > w2 > w3 m2: w2 > w3 > w1 m3: w3 > w1 > w2 w1: m1 > m2 > m3 w2: m2 > m3 > m1 w3: m3 > m1 > m2 In this situation, ideal pairings are very unstable, since each man and woman favours their spouse's mate above themselves. However, if the preferences are acyclic, there is a method known as the Top Trading Cycles algorithm that guarantees a perfect match with no significant instability. The algorithm regularly identifies a cycle of men and women who want to be paired with each other, and then "trades" them such that each individual receives their first choice. It can be shown that the algorithm ends with a stable pairing and that the resulting pairing is always stable.
