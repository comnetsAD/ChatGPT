When ties are permitted in the ranking, it is not guaranteed that a perfect match with no significant instability will always exist. If there are two men and two women, and both men and women have the same preference list with a tie between the two members of the opposite gender as their first preference and the other member as their last preference, this is an example of a set of men and women with preference lists for which every perfect matching has a strong instability. In this circumstance, any ideal pairing would be unstable since both men desire the other woman and both women prefer the other guy. In the event of ties, however, the algorithm "Top Trading Cycles algorithm (TTC)" is guaranteed to identify a perfect match with no substantial instability. The method finds cycles of mismatched pairings (m,w) in which m prefers w to his current match and w prefers m to her current match. Then, each couple in the cycle gets paired with their cycle's top option. This method ensures no significant instability and ends in limited time.
