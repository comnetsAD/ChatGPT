It is not impossible for there to be a group of men and women who each have preference lists in such a way that every ideal match results in high levels of instability. Take, for instance, the scenario in which there are two men and two women, and both men and women have the same preference list, and on that list, they both have a tie for their first choice between two members of the opposing gender, with the other person serving as their final preference. In this scenario, the ideal pairing of a man with one woman and a woman with another guy would be very unstable since each of the individuals in the couple would have a preference for the other person. On the other hand, using the Gale-Shapley method ensures that a perfect matching will be found even in the presence of significant instability. The algorithm moves forward by having the men propose to their top choice, and if a woman receives more than one proposal, she chooses the man she prefers the most and rejects the others. If a woman receives more than one proposal, the algorithm moves forward by having the men propose to their top choice. After that, the guys who were rejected go on to their next option, and the process is repeated until every single man and lady is paired with someone. This method is guaranteed to discover a stable matching since it assures that neither man or woman may be paired with someone they strongly prefer over their present match. This prevents either gender from having their preferences overridden and leading to an unstable match.
