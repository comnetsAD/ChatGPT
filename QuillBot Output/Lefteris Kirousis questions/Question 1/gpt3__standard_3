The Stable Roommates Problem is a variant of the Stable Matching Problem with ties (SRP). It is well known that the SRP sometimes lacks a solution devoid of significant instability. The following is an example of a pair of men and women with preference lists that lacks perfect matching and significant instability: Men: 1, 2, and 3. Women are represented as w1, w2, and w3. Men are represented as m1: w1 > w2 > w3 m2: w2 > w3 > w1 m3: w3 > w1 > w2 w1: m1 > m2 > m3 w3: m3 > m1 > m2 Because every man and woman in this situation prefers their spouse's mate over themselves, every ideal pairing has a significant amount of instability. However, there is a method called Top Trading Cycles algorithm that is guaranteed to discover a perfect match with no significant instability if the preferences are acyclic. In order to ensure that each individual receives their first pick, the algorithm continually identifies a cycle of men and women who would want to be paired with one another. It is demonstrable that the algorithm ends with a stable matching and that the resulting matching is always stable.
