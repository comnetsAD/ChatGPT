When ties are permitted in the ranking, it is not a given that there will always be a perfect matching without any significant instability. If there are two men and two women and both have the same preference list with a tie between the two members of the opposite gender as their first preference and the other member as their last preference, this is an example of a group of men and women with preference lists for which every perfect matching has a strong instability. In this situation, any ideal pairing would have significant instability since both men and women would like the other lady. In the event of ties, the Top Trading Cycles algorithm (TTC) is certain to discover a perfect matching with no significant instability. Finding cycles of mismatched couples (m,w) in which m prefers w over his current match and w prefers m over her current match is how the algorithm moves forward. The top candidate from the cycle is then paired with each partner in the cycle. This method ensures no significant instability and ends in limited time.
