A group of men and women with preference lists such that every ideal match has a significant instability might occur. Consider, for instance, a situation in which there are two men and two women, and both men and women have the identical list of preferences, with the two members of the opposing gender tied as their first and final choices. In this instance, the ideal pairing of (m1,w1) and (m2,w2) would be very unstable since both men and women would favor the other woman. The Gale-Shapley method, on the other hand, is certain to locate a perfect match with no significant instability. If a lady gets more than one proposal, the algorithm moves on by having the men approach their top pick. If she does, she selects the guy she likes most and rejects the others. The procedure is repeated until every man and lady has been paired with someone, at which point the rejected males go on to their next option. Because no man or woman may be paired with someone they strictly prefer over their existing match, this algorithm is guaranteed to find a stable match.
