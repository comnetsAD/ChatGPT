When ties are permitted in rankings, it is not guaranteed that there will always be a perfect match with no significant instability. If there are two men and two women, and both men and women have the same preference list, with a tie between the two members of the opposite gender as their first choice and the other member as their final option, then any ideal pairing has a high degree of instability. In this situation, any ideal pairing will be unstable, since both men and women want the other partner. In the event of ties, however, the algorithm "Top Trading Cycles algorithm (TTC)" is guaranteed to identify a perfect match with no significant instability. Finding cycles of mismatched couples (m,w) in which m prefers w over his current match and w prefers m over his current match is the next step of the algorithm. Then, each couple in the cycle gets paired with their preferred option from the cycle. This method concludes in a limited amount of time and ensures no severe instability.
