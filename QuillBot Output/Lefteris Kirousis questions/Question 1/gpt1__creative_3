The possibility exists that there is a group of men and women with preference lists where each perfect match is very unstable. Let's say there are four people total, two men and two women, and both men and women have the identical preference list, with one member of the other gender tied for first place and the other person tied for last place. Both men and women in a perfect pairing of (m1, w1) and (m2, w2) would have significant preferences for the other partner. The Gale-Shapley method, on the other hand, is guaranteed to locate a perfect matching in the absence of any robust instability. Men then make proposals to their top picks, and if a woman gets more than one, she selects the one she likes most and rejects the others based on the algorithm's recommendations. Men who aren't accepted by one lady go on to the next option, and so on, until everyone has a suitable suitor. In order to establish a steady match, our algorithm makes sure that no man or woman may be paired with someone they would like less.
