It is feasible for there to exist a group of men and women with preference lists such that every ideal match has a high degree of instability. Consider, for instance, a situation in which there are two men and two women, and both men and women have the same preference list, with a tie between the two members of the opposite gender as their first choice and the other person as their final option. In this instance, the ideal pairing of (m1,w1) and (m2,w2) would be very unstable, since both men and women would choose the other partner. The Gale-Shapley method, on the other hand, is guaranteed to discover a perfect match with no significant instability. If a lady gets many proposals, she picks the one she likes best and rejects the others. The rejected males then go on to their next option, and the procedure is repeated until each man and woman is paired with a partner. This algorithm guarantees a stable match since it assures that no man nor woman may be paired with a person they like more than their existing partner.
