For cases of a tie in the stable matching, see the Stable Roommates Problem (SRP). It is well-known that there is not always a solution to the SRP that is stable under significant perturbations. This is an example of a group of men and women who have preference lists but do not have perfect matching and high instability: There are three sex codes for males: m1, m2, and m3. Women: w1, w2, and w3; men: m1, m2, and m3; m1: w1 > w2 > w3; m2: w2 > w3 > w1; and m3: w3 > w1 > w2; m1: w1 > m2 > m3; and m3: w3 > m1 > m2; and so on. Since both men and women tend to favor their partners' other half above their own, it follows that any ideal pairing is very unstable. If the preferences are acyclic, however, an approach known as the Top Trading Cycles algorithm may be used to obtain a perfect match with no significant instability. The algorithm "trades" potential partners so that everyone gets their first pick, and it does this in cycles until it has found a pair of men and women who both want to be with the other. It has been shown that the algorithm always results in a stable matching at its conclusion.
