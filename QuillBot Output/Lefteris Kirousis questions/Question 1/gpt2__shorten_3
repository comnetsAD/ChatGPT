When rankings enable ties, complete matching without substantial instability is not ensured. If there are two men and two women and each have the same preference list with a tie between the two opposite gender members as their first choice and the other member as their final preference, any perfect matching has a severe instability. Since both men and women want the other, any ideal relationship will be unstable. The "Top Trading Cycles algorithm (TTC)" guarantees a perfect match without substantial instability in ties. The method finds cycles of mismatched pairings (m,w) where m prefers w and w prefers m. Each pair's top pick is then paired. This method is finite and stable.
