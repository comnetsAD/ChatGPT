The Stable Matching Problem sometimes goes by the name of the Stable Roommates Problem when there are ties (SRP). It is well knowledge that the SRP does not reliably possess a solution that does not include a significant degree of instability. The following is an example of a collection of men and women with preference lists that does not have any perfect matching but also does not have any significant instability: Men: m1, m2, m3 Women: w1, w2, w3 m1: w1 > w2 > w3 m2: w2 > w3 > w1 m3: w3 > w1 > w2 w1: m1 > m2 > m3 w2: m2 > m3 > m1 w3: m3 > m1 > m2 In this scenario, every ideal pairing has a high degree of instability since each man and woman would rather spend time with their partner's significant other than with themselves. On the other hand, if the preferences are acyclic, there is a method known as the Top Trading Cycles algorithm that will discover a perfect matching even if there is a significant amount of instability in the system. The algorithm searches for cycles of men and women who would prefer to be matched with each other, and then "trades" them so that each person gets their first choice of partner. This process is repeated until the algorithm finds a cycle of men and women who would prefer to be matched with each other. It is possible to demonstrate both that the algorithm is guaranteed to create stable matchings and that it will always end with a stable pairing.
