Stable Roommates Problem: Stable Matching Problem with ties (SRP). SRP solutions are not always stable. The following collection of men and women with preference lists exhibits no perfect matching and no significant instability: M1, m2, m3. Women: w1, w2, w3 m1: w1 > w2 > w3 m2: w2 > w3 > w1 m3: m3 > m1 > m2 Each man and woman likes their spouse's mate to themselves, hence every ideal pairing is unstable. If preferences are acyclic, the Top Trading Cycles method guarantees a perfect match without substantial instability. The computer continuously discovers a cycle of men and women who want to be paired and "trades" them to give everyone their first choice. The method always produces a stable matching, and it can be shown.
