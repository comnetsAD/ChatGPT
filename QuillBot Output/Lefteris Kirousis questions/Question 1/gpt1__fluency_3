It is feasible to have a collection of men and women with preference lists so that every ideal match has a high level of instability. Consider the following scenario: there are two men and two women, and both men and women have the same preference list, with a tie between the two members of the opposing gender as their first choice and the other person as their final option. In this situation, the ideal pairing of (m1,w1) and (m2,w2) would be unstable since both men would prefer the other woman and both women would prefer the other guy. The Gale-Shapley method, on the other hand, is guaranteed to discover a perfect match with no significant instability. The algorithm then has the men propose to their top pick, and if a lady gets many proposals, she selects the guy she likes the most and rejects the others. The rejected men go on to their next option, and the process is repeated until every man and lady is paired with someone. This algorithm guarantees that a stable match will be found since it assures that no man or woman will be paired with someone they prefer over their present match.
