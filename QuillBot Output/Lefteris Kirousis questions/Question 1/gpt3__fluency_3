The Stable Roommates Problem is another name for the Stable Matching Problem with Ties (SRP). It is well known that the SRP does not always have a solution that is free of significant instability. The following is an example of a collection of men and women with preference lists that has no perfect matching but no substantial instability: m1, m2, m3 for men Women: w1, w2, w3 m1: w1 > w2 > w3 m2: w2 > w3 > w1 m3: w3 > w1 > w2 w1: m1 > m2 > m3 w2: m2 > m3 Every ideal match has a significant instability in this scenario, since each man and woman prefers their spouse's mate over themselves. If the preferences are acyclic, however, there is an approach known as the Top Trading Cycles algorithm that is guaranteed to discover a perfect match with no substantial instability. The computer discovers a cycle of men and women who would like to be paired with each other and then "trades" them such that everyone gets their first choice. It is possible to demonstrate that the algorithm always ends with a stable matching and that the matching generated is always stable.
