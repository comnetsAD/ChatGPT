A group of men and women with preference lists that makes every ideal matching unstable is achievable. For instance, two men and two women share the same preference list, with a tie between the two opposite-gender members as their first choice and the other as their final option. Both men and women would choose the other, making the ideal pairing of (m1,w1) and (m2,w2) unstable. The Gale-Shapley method guarantees a perfect matching without substantial instability. The system has men propose to their top pick, and if a lady gets many proposals, she selects the guy she likes and rejects the others. Rejected men go on to their next pick, and the process continues until every man and woman is matched. This algorithm guarantees a stable match by preventing men and women from being paired with someone they prefer over their present match.
