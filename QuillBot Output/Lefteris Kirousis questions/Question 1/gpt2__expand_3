When ties are permitted in the ranking, it is not a given that there will always be a perfect matching in which there is no significant instability. This is not a guarantee. If there are two men and two women, and both men and women have the same preference list, and on that list they both have a tie between two members of the opposite gender as their first preference, and on that list they both have the other member as their last preference, then this is an example of a set of men and women with preference lists for which every perfect matching has a strong instability. In this scenario, every perfect matching has a high degree of instability. In this scenario, every ideal pairing would be fraught with significant instability due to the fact that both men and women would choose the other person's company above their own. On the other hand, the algorithm known as the "Top Trading Cycles algorithm (TTC)" is guaranteed to discover a perfect matching and does not exhibit any significant instability in the event of ties. Finding cycles of mismatched couples (m,w) is the next step in the algorithm's process. These pairs are identified by the fact that one member of the pair favors the other member over their present partner. After that, each member of each couple in the cycle gets paired with the member of the cycle who was their first pick. This method is guaranteed to have no significant instability and it finishes in a limited amount of time.
