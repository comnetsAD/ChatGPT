This is a correct assertion. This assertion may be validated on the condition that there exist positive constants c and d, with c being less than 1, in such a way that f(n) = cg(n) + d for any n that are sufficiently big. When we multiply both sides of the inequality by 2, we get the result that 2f(n) is less than or equal to 2cg(n) plus 2d for any n that are big enough. Now that we have shown that the right-hand side of the inequality is O(2g(n)), we can deduce that the answer to the question 2f(n) is likewise O(2g(n)). This ensures that the rate of growth of f(n) is not greater than the rate of growth of g(n), which means that 2f(n) is also not greater than 2g. It is important to note that the inequality f(n) = cg(n) + d, with c 1, holds true for all large enough n. Since c 1, this ensures that the rate of growth of f(n) is not greater than the rate of growth (n). As a result, the assertion that "If there are positive constants c, d, with c 1, such that f(n) = cg(n) + d for all big enough n, then 2f (n) equals O(2g(n))" is correct. This is due to the fact that "If there are positive constants c, d, with c 1."
