The assertion is accurate. This conclusion may be shown by assuming the existence of positive constants c and d, with c 1, such that f(n) = cg(n) + d for every sufficiently big n. Consequently, 2f(n) = 2cg(n) + 2d for any sufficiently big n. 2cg(n) is O(2g(n)), and 2d is a constant, so it is likewise O(2g(n)). Therefore, 2f(n) = 2cg(n) + 2d is O(2g(n)), therefore 2f (n) is also O(2g(n)). Noting that this assertion is valid as long as c=1 is important, since if c > 1, the inequality f(n) = cg(n) + d would not hold.
