This is a correct statement. The assertion may be proven by assuming the existence of two positive constants, c and d, with c 1, such that for any n sufficiently big, f(n) = cg(n) + d. In other words, given sufficiently big n, 2f(n) = 2cg(n) + 2d. Given that 2cg(n) is O(2g(n)) and 2d is a constant and therefore O(2g(n)) as well, we can deduce that 2f(n) = 2cg(n) + 2d is O(2g(n)) as well. It is important to note that if c > 1, the inequality f(n) = cg(n) + d would not hold, hence the assertion is only valid when c = 1.
