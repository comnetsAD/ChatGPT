The assertion is accurate. This conclusion may be shown by assuming the existence of positive constants c and d, with c 1, such that f(n) = cg(n) + d for every sufficiently big n. By multiplying both sides by 2, we get 2f(n) = 2cg(n) + 2d for any sufficiently big n. Now since the right-hand side of the inequality is O(2g(n)), it follows that 2f(n) is likewise O(2g(n)). Noting that the inequality f(n) = cg(n) + d, with c 1, remains true for every sufficiently big n assures that the rate of growth of f(n) is not larger than the rate of growth of g(n), and that 2f(n) is not more than 2g (n). The statement "If there exist positive constants c, d, with c 1, such that f(n) = cg(n) + d for every sufficiently big n, then 2f (n) equals O(2g(n))" is thus valid.
