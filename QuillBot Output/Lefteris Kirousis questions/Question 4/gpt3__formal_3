This assertion is accurate. We may demonstrate this using the definition of the big O notation. A function f(n) is O(g(n)) if there are positive constants c and n0 such that for any n n0, f(n) cg (n). Given that f(n) cg(n) + d for every sufficiently big n, this inequality may be rewritten as f(n) cg(n) + d for all n n0, where n0 is the point at which the inequality holds for all n n0. Now, examine 2f(n) = f(n) + f(n) â‰¤ (cg(n) + d) + (cg(n) + d) = 2cg(n) + 2d. Since we can find positive constants c=2 and d=2 such that 2f(n) 2cg(n) + 2d for any n n0, 2f(n) is O(2g(n)).
