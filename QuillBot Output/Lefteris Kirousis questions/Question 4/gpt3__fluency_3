This assertion is correct. To demonstrate this, consider the definition of the big O notation. A function f(n) is said to be O(g(n)) if there are positive constants c and n0 such that f(n) cg for every n n0 (n). Given that f(n) cg(n) + d for any sufficiently big n, we may rephrase this as f(n) cg(n) + d for all n n0, where n0 is the point where the inequality holds for all n n0. Consider the expression 2f(n) = f(n) + f(n) (cg(n) + d) + (cg(n) + d) = 2cg(n) + 2d. 2f(n) is therefore O(2g(n)), since we can find positive constants c=2 and d=2 such that 2f(n) = 2cg(n) + 2d for every n n0.
