The assertion is accurate. By assuming that there exist positive constants c and d, with c 1, such that f(n) = cg(n) + d for any big enough n, we may demonstrate this claim. Inequality 2f(n) = 2cg(n) + 2d is obtained by multiplying both sides of the inequality by 2 for any sufficiently big n. Now that we have shown that the inequality's right-hand side is O(2g(n)), we may infer that 2f(n) is likewise O(2g(n)). It is crucial to remember that for any sufficiently big n, the inequality f(n) = cg(n) + d, with c 1, remains true, ensuring that the rate of increase of f(n) is not larger than the rate of growth of g(n), and that 2f(n) is not more than 2g (n). In light of this, it is true that "If there exist positive constants c, d, with c 1, such that f(n) = cg(n) + d for any sufficiently big n, then 2f (n) equals O(2g(n)")
