True. Assuming positive constants c and d, with c < 1, f(n) <= cg(n) + d for every big n proves this proposition. For any big n, 2f(n) <= 2cg(n) + 2d by multiplying both sides of the inequality by 2. The right-hand side of the inequality is O(2g(n)), hence 2f(n) is likewise O(2g(n)). The inequality f(n) <= cg(n) + d, with c < 1, remains true for any big enough n, ensuring that the rate of growth of f(n) is not larger than that of g(n) and that 2f(n) is not more than 2g(n) (n). Thus, "If there exist positive constants c, d, with c < 1, such that f(n) <= cg(n) + d for every big enough n, then 2f(n) equals O(2g(n))" is true.
