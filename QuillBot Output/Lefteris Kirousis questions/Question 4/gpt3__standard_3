This assertion is accurate. We may utilize the big O notation's definition to demonstrate this. If there are positive constants c and n0 such that for any n n0, f(n) cg, then a function f(n) is said to be O(g(n)) (n). We may rephrase this as f(n) cg(n) + d for all n n0, where n0 is the point at which the inequality holds for all n n0, given that f(n) cg(n) + d for all big enough n. Consider the following expression: 2f(n) = f(n) + f(n) (cg(n) + d) + (cg(n) + d) = 2cg(n) + 2d. Since we may discover the positive constants c=2 and d=2 such that 2f(n) 2cg(n) + 2d for any n n0, 2f(n) is thus O(2g(n)).
