This is a correct assertion. This assertion may be validated on the condition that there exist positive constants c and d, with c being less than 1, in such a way that f(n) = cg(n) + d for any n that are sufficiently big. Therefore, 2f(n) is equivalent to 2cg(n) plus 2d for any n that are big enough. As we can see, 2cg(n) has the property that it is O(2g(n)), and because 2d is a constant, it also has the property that it is O(2g(n)). Since 2f(n) = 2cg(n) + 2d has the property that it is O(2g(n)), this demonstrates that 2f (n) also has the property that it is O(2g(n)). It is important to point out that this assertion is correct so long as c is less than or equal to 1. This is due to the fact that if c is greater than 1, the inequality f(n) = cg(n) + d would no longer be valid.
