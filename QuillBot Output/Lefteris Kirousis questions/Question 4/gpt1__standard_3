The assertion is accurate. By assuming that there exist positive constants c and d, with c 1, such that f(n) = cg(n) + d for any big enough n, we may demonstrate this claim. Therefore, for any n that are big enough, 2f(n) = 2cg(n) + 2d. As we can see, 2cg(n) is O(2g(n)) and 2d is a constant, making them both O(2g(n)). Since 2f(n) = 2cg(n) + 2d, which is likewise O(2g(n)), 2f(n) is also O(2g(n)). It's important to note that if c > 1, the inequality f(n) = cg(n) + d would not hold, hence it's important to note that this assertion holds as long as c = 1.
