This is an accurate statement. The definition of the large O notation provides the proof we need. It is claimed that a function f(n) is O(g(n)) if there are two positive constants c and n0 such that for any n n0, f(n) cg (n). If we assume that f(n) is less than cg(n) plus d for any sufficiently big n, then we may express this as f(n) is less than cg(n) plus d for all n n0, where n0 is the value of n such that the inequality holds for all n n0. Here we look at the relationship between 2f(n) and cg(n) + d, where 2f(n) = f(n) + f(n) cg(n) + d = 2cg(n) + 2d. For any n >= n0, we can find positive constants c=2 and d=2 such that 2f(n) 2cg(n) + 2d. Hence, 2f(n) is O(2g(n)).
