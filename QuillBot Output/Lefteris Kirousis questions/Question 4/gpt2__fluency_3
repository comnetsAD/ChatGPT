The assertion is correct. This assertion may be proved by assuming that there exist positive constants c and d, with c 1 such that f(n) = cg(n) + d for all big enough n. For any n big enough, multiplying both sides of the inequality by 2 yields 2f(n) = 2cg(n) + 2d. The right-hand side of the inequality is now O(2g(n)), implying that 2f(n) is likewise O(2g(n)). It is worth noting that the inequality f(n)= cg(n) + d, with c 1, remains true for every big enough n, ensuring that the rate of growth of f(n) is not larger than the rate of growth of g(n), and therefore 2f(n) is not more than 2g (n). As a result, the statement "If there exist positive constants c, d, with c 1 such that f(n) = cg(n) + d for every sufficiently big n, then 2f (n) equals O(2g(n)") is correct.
