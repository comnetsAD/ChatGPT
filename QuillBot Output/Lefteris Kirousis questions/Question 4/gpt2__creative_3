This is a correct statement. The assertion may be proven by assuming the existence of two positive constants, c and d, with c 1, such that for any n sufficiently big, f(n) = cg(n) + d. For any sufficiently big n, the inequality is resolved to 2f(n) = 2cg(n) + 2d by multiplying both sides by 2. To complete the picture, we can see that 2f(n) is likewise O(2g(n)) because the right-hand side of the inequality is O(2g(n)). For any sufficiently big n, the inequality f(n) = cg(n) + d, where c 1, guarantees that the rate of growth of f(n) is not larger than the rate of growth of g(n), and therefore that 2f(n) = 2g (n). Therefore, 2f (n) is O(2g(n)) if there exist positive constants c, d, with c 1, such that f(n) = cg(n) + d for every n sufficiently big.
