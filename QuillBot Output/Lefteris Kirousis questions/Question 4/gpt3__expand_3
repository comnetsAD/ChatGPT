This characterization is accurate. This may be shown by referring to the definition of the "big O" notation. It is claimed that a function f(n) has the complexity O(g(n)) if there are positive constants c and n0 such that for any n that are more than n0, f(n) is less than cg (n). Given that f(n) is less than cg(n) plus d for any n that are sufficiently big, we may rephrase this as f(n) is less than cg(n) plus d for all n that are less than n0, where n0 is the point at which the inequality holds for all n that are less than n0. Now, examine 2f(n) = f(n) + f(n) â‰¤ (cg(n) + d) + (cg(n) + d) = 2cg(n) + 2d. Since we can find positive constants c=2 and d=2 such that 2f(n) 2cg(n) + 2d for any n that is less than n0, we may conclude that 2f(n) is equivalent to O(2g(n)).
