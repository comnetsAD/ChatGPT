The assertion is correct. This assertion may be proved by assuming that there exist positive constants c and d, with c 1 such that f(n) = cg(n) + d for all big enough n. As a result, for any sufficiently big n, 2f(n) = 2cg(n) + 2d. As we can see, 2cg(n) is O(2g(n)), and 2d is a constant, therefore it is also O(2g(n)), thus 2f(n) = 2cg(n) + 2d is O(2g(n)), and 2f (n) is O(2g(n)). It is worth noting that this assertion is valid as long as c=1, since the inequality f(n) = cg(n) + d would not hold if c > 1.
