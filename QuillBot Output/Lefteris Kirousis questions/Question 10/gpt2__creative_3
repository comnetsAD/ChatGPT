Unfortunately, there is no such thing as an ideal task schedule that both accounts for an inversion and reduces the number of late deliveries. An ideal schedule is one that keeps tasks running on time as much as possible while still meeting all of the problem's other requirements. If two tasks are run on a system in the wrong sequence, the one that has the earlier deadline will end up finishing later than it has to. Since inversions increase the likelihood of being late and so break the constraints of the issue, they have no place in a best-case timetable. Job scheduling that incorporates inversions is technically conceivable, but it is suboptimal since it does not reduce lateness and it breaks the restrictions of the original issue.
