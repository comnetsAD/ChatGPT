No, it is not feasible to have an ideal employment schedule that includes an inversion and reduces lateness. A schedule inversion happens when two tasks are put on the same machine in a manner that the task that should be done first by their deadlines is instead finished last. An ideal timetable should never cause jobs to be late, hence it should steer clear of inversions since they may make tasks more tardy. The Earliest Deadline First (EDF) method is one scheduling technique that may be used to address this issue without using inversions, despite the fact that it may seem that inversion might be advantageous in certain situations, such as when two tasks have extremely tight deadlines. As a result, an ideal timetable shouldn't include inversions since doing so would violate the requirement for minimum lateness.
