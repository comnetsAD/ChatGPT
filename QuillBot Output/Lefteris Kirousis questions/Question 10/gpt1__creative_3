The answer is yes, it is feasible to create an ideal employment schedule that both reduces lateness as much as possible and includes an inversion. When two tasks are scheduled for the same machine, but their due dates are reversed from one another, this is called an inversion in the schedule. Even while it's preferable to keep things running on time, or as close to that as feasible, even the best schedules sometimes have to flip tasks around. It may be required to reverse the sequence of tasks on a machine, with the effect that the work that should complete first actually ends up finishing last, if, for example, both jobs have very short turnaround times. Therefore, in order to reduce task delays as much as possible, inversions may be included in an ideal timetable.
