Unfortunately, there is no such thing as an ideal task schedule that both accounts for an inversion and reduces the number of late deliveries. When two tasks are scheduled for the same machine, but their due dates are reversed from one another, this is called an inversion in the schedule. An ideal timetable should always aim to reduce task lateness to a minimum, therefore inversions should be avoided if at all possible. However, there are alternative scheduling methods, such as the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) algorithm, that may be used to address such a problem without adding inversions, even if it may appear that inversion might be advantageous in certain instances, such as when two tasks have extremely tight deadlines. Therefore, inversions are never permitted in a timetable that meets the minimum lateness criteria.
