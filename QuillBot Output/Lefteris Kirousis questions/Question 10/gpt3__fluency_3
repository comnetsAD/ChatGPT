No, it is not feasible to have optimum task scheduling that minimizes lateness while still including an inversion. A schedule inversion happens when two tasks are allocated to the same machine in such a manner that the work that should be completed first based on their deadlines is actually completed after the other job. An ideal timetable should always reduce work lateness, and so should avoid inversions, which may increase job lateness. Even though inversion may seem to be advantageous in certain circumstances, such as when two tasks have extremely tight deadlines, there are alternate scheduling methods, such as the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) algorithm, that may be used to tackle similar problems without introducing inversions. As a result, an optimum schedule should not include inversions since this would violate the least lateness constraint.
