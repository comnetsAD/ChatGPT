No, it is not feasible to have optimum task scheduling that minimizes lateness while still including an inversion. An ideal schedule is one that reduces task lateness while simultaneously complying to issue limitations such as deadlines and processing times. Inverting the order of two tasks on a machine implies that the work that should have been completed first according to their deadlines is instead completed after the other, resulting in lateness. Since a consequence, an optimum schedule should not include any inversions, as this would result in increasing lateness and violate the problem requirements. While it is feasible to schedule tasks using inversions, it is not regarded ideal since it does not decrease lateness and violates the problem constraints.
