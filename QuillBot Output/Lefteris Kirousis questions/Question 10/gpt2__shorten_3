Job scheduling with an inversion and minimal lateness is not achievable. An ideal timetable reduces task lateness while meeting issue limitations like deadlines and processing times. Inverting the order of two tasks on a machine implies that the work that should complete first according to deadlines will finish after the other job, causing lateness. Inversions increase lateness and violate problem constraints, hence an ideal schedule should not include any. Inversions may be used to schedule tasks, however they increase lateness and violate problem constraints.
