Job scheduling with an inversion and minimal lateness is not achievable. When two tasks are assigned to the same machine, the work with the earlier deadline finishes after the other. Inversions may delay tasks, therefore a good timetable avoids them. The Earliest Deadline First (EDF) method can tackle problems like two tasks with extremely tight deadlines without inversions. Thus, the least lateness constraint prohibits inversions in an ideal timetable.
