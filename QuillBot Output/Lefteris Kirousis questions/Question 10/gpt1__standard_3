Yes, it is feasible to schedule tasks in the best way possible while still having an inversion and minimizing lateness. A schedule inversion happens when two tasks are put on the same machine in a manner that the task that should be done first by their deadlines is instead finished last. Even though a perfect timetable would aim to reduce employment lateness, inversions can occur. Example: Even though it would cause the work that should be done first to be finished last, it could be essential to reverse the order of two jobs on a machine if they both had very short deadlines in order to accomplish them both on time. So, if it's required to reduce task lateness, an ideal timetable may include inversions.
