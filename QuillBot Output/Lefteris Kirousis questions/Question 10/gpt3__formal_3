No, it is not feasible to create an ideal work schedule that reduces tardiness while including an inversion. The inversion of a schedule happens when two tasks are allocated to the same machine in such a manner that the work that should have been completed first according to their respective deadlines gets completed after the other job. An ideal schedule should always aim to reduce work lateness, hence it should avoid inversions, which may increase job lateness. Even while it may seem that inversion might be advantageous in some situations, such as when two tasks have very tight deadlines, alternative scheduling methods, such as the Earliest Deadline First (EDF) algorithm, can be utilized to handle the issue without introducing inversions. Therefore, an optimum timetable should not include inversions, since they would break the criteria of minimum lateness.
