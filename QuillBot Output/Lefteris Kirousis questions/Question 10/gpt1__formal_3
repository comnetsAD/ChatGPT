Yes, it is feasible to create an ideal work schedule that reduces tardiness while including an inversion. The inversion of a schedule happens when two tasks are allocated to the same machine in such a manner that the work that should have been completed first according to their respective deadlines gets completed after the other job. Even though an optimum timetable should reduce task lateness, inversions cannot always be avoided. For instance, if two projects have very tight deadlines, it may be essential to reverse their order on a machine in order to complete them both on time, despite the fact that the work that should be completed first will be completed last. Therefore, an optimum schedule may include inversions if it is important to reduce the number of tasks that are late.
