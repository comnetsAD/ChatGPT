No, it is not feasible to create an ideal work schedule that reduces tardiness while including an inversion. A schedule that reduces the lateness of tasks while adhering to the problem's limitations, such as deadlines and processing times, is optimum. Inverting the order of two tasks on a machine results in the work that should have been completed first according to their respective deadlines being completed after the other job, resulting in lateness. Therefore, an ideal schedule should not include any inversions, since doing so would increase tardiness and violate the problem's constraints. Although it is feasible to schedule tasks using inversions, it is not ideal since it does not decrease lateness and violates the problem's requirements.
