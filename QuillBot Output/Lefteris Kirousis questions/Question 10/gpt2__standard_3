No, it is not feasible to have an ideal employment schedule that includes an inversion and reduces lateness. An ideal timetable is one that adheres to the restrictions of the issue, such as deadlines and processing periods, but also minimizing the lateness of activities. When two tasks are performed in reverse order on a machine, the task that should be completed first based on their deadlines is instead completed after the other task, which would result in a delay. As a consequence, an ideal schedule shouldn't include any inversions since doing so would raise lateness and go against the problem's restrictions. Even if it is feasible to schedule tasks in a manner that includes inversions, doing so would not be regarded as optimum since it would not reduce lateness and would go against the restrictions of the issue.
