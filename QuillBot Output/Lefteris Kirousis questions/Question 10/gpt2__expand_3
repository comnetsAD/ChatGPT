No, it is not feasible to have an optimum scheduling of tasks that both reduces the amount of lateness and includes an inversion in the same schedule. An ideal timetable is one that reduces the number of tasks that are completed late while still satisfying the requirements imposed by the issue at hand, such as time limits and benchmarks for completion. If the sequence in which two tasks are performed on a machine is switched around, the work that should have been completed first in accordance with the deadlines for both jobs will instead be completed after the other job, which will result in a delay. Therefore, an optimum schedule should not have any inversions, since this would lead to increasing tardiness and break the constraints of the issue. If it does contain inversions, the schedule is not optimal. Although it is feasible to schedule tasks in such a manner that inversions are present, doing so is not regarded to be ideal since it does not reduce the amount of time that jobs run late and it violates the problem's requirements.
