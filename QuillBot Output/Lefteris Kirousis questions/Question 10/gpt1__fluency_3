Yes, it is feasible to have optimum work scheduling that minimizes lateness while still including an inversion. A schedule inversion happens when two tasks are allocated to the same machine in such a manner that the work that should be completed first based on their deadlines is actually completed after the other job. Even though an optimum timetable should reduce task lateness, inversions are not always avoidable. For example, if two projects have extremely tight deadlines, it may be essential to flip their order on a machine in order to accomplish them both on time, even if it means that the work that should be done first gets completed last. As a result, an optimum timetable may include inversions if it is important to reduce task lateness.
