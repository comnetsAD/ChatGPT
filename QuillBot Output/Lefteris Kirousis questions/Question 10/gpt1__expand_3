The answer is yes; it is feasible to have an optimum scheduling of tasks that reduces the amount of lateness while still including an inversion. An inversion in a schedule happens when two tasks are allocated to the same machine in such a manner that the project that should be done first according to their respective deadlines is actually finished after the other job has been completed. This is the opposite of what should happen. Even though a well-designed schedule ought to reduce the number of tasks that go behind schedule, it is not always feasible to steer clear of inversions. For instance, if two projects have very short due dates, it may be essential to switch around the order in which they are completed on a machine in order to complete both of them on time. This is the case even if it will cause the work that is supposed to be completed first to be completed last. Therefore, an ideal timetable may include inversions if it is important to reduce the amount of tasks that are completed late.
