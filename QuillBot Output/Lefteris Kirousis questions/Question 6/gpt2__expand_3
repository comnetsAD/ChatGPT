False. When the lengths are replaced by 2le, it is possible for the shortest pathways from s to any other node t to shift. A graph with two nodes, denoted as s and t, and two directed edges, denoted as (s,t) and (t,s), each carrying a weight of le1 and le2 in turn might serve as an alternative example. If we were to double the length by 2, then the shortest route from s to t would be via the edge (t,s) with the length 2*le2. However, if we were to multiply the length by 1, then the shortest path would be through the edge (s,t) with the length le1. Formally proving it is possible if we assume that the shortest route from u to v in the original graph G is represented by the node D(u,v). Let's call the graph that results from multiplying all of the weights by 2 and calling it G'. If a path P in G' is shorter than D(u,v), then we can show that there exists a path P' in G such that the length of P' is less than D(u,v), which contradicts the definition of D(u,v) as the shortest path. If a path P in G' is shorter than D(u,v), then we can show that there exists a path P' in G such that the length of P' is less than D(u,v Because of this, we are able to draw the conclusion that the shortest pathways from s to any other node t may shift when we substitute the lengths with 2le.
