False. If the lengths are replaced by 2le, the shortest pathways from s to any other node t may alter. A counterexample may be a network consisting of two nodes, s and t, and two directed edges, (s,t) and (t,s), with corresponding weights le1 and le2. The shortest route from s to t is via the edge (s,t) with length le1, but if this length is multiplied by two, the shortest path is now through the edge (t,s) with length 2*le2. By assuming that D(u,v) is the shortest route from u to v in the original graph G, we may prove it explicitly. Let G' be the graph created by increasing each weight by 2 and superimposing it on G. If a route P in G' is shorter than D(u,v), then there exists a path P' in G with a shorter length than D(u,v), which violates the definition of D(u,v) as the shortest path. Therefore, we may deduce that the shortest pathways from s to any other node t are susceptible to modification if the lengths are substituted with 2le.
