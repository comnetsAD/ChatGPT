False. If the lengths are replaced by 2le, the shortest routes from node s to any other node t remain unchanged. Proof: The path with the smallest sum of edge weights is said to be the shortest route between s and t. The total of edge weights for each route will also be multiplied by 2 if we multiply all edge weights by this factor. The new shortest route will still be the one with the least sum of edge weights since multiplying a minimum value by a constant doesn't affect its minimum value. Counter-example: Consider a directed graph G with 3 nodes (s, A, and t), 2 edges (s, A), and 1 edge (A, t). (s,A,t) is the route that travels the smallest distance between s and t. The shortest route is still (s,A,t) with a distance of 6 even if the weights are changed to 22 = 4 and 21 = 2, respectively. It is important to notice that this is only the case if the weights are positive; otherwise, the shortest route may vary.
