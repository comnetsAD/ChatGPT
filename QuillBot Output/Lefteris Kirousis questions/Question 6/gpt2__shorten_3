False. Replace lengths with 2le to modify the shortest routes from s to any other node t. A network with two nodes, s and t, and two directed edges, (s,t) and (t,s), with weights le1 and le2, is a counterexample. If we double the length by 2, the shortest route from s to t becomes the edge (t,s) with length 2*le2. Assuming D(u,v) is the shortest route from u to v in the original graph G, we can prove it explicitly. G' is G multiplied by 2. If a route P in G' is shorter than D(u,v), we may prove that there exists a path P' in G with a length smaller than D(u,v), which violates the notion of the shortest path. Thus, 2le lengths modify the shortest pathways from s to any other node t.
