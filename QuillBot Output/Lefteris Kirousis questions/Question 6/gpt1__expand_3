False. When the lengths are changed by 2le, there is no discernible difference in the shortest pathways that can be taken from s to any of the other nodes t. Demonstration: The path that has the lowest total edge weight is the one that is considered to be the shortest route from point s to point t. If we doubled the weight of each edge by 2, the total edge weight of every route would also be multiplied by 2. Since multiplying a minimal value by a constant does not modify the minimum value of the product, the route with the smallest sum of edge weights will continue to be the shortest path after the multiplication is performed. Counter-example: Take into consideration a directed graph G that has three nodes labeled s, A, and t, as well as two edges labeled (s,A) with a weight of 2, and (A,t) with a weight of 1. The route (s,A,t) has a distance of three and is the shortest route from s to t. Even if we change the weights to 22 = 4 and 21 = 2, respectively, the route with the shortest distance is still (s,A,t), and it has a length of 6. It is essential to keep in mind that this is only valid if the weights are positive; if the weights are negative, it may result in a different shortest route being calculated.
