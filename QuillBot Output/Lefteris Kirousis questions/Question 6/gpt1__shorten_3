False. Changing lengths to 2le does not affect the shortest routes from s to any other node t. Proof: The shortest route from s to t has the lowest edge weight total. Multiplying all edge weights by 2 multiplies the sum of edge weights for any route. The new shortest route will still have the smallest sum of edge weights since multiplying a minimal value by a constant doesn't affect it. Counter-example: Consider a directed graph G with three nodes s, A, and t, two edges (s,A) with weight 2 and (A,t) with weight 1. The shortest route from s to t is (s,A,t), 3. The shortest route with a distance of 6 is still (s,A,t) with weights 22 = 4 and 21 = 2. This is true only if the weights are positive; negative weights may modify the shortest route.
