False. With the lengths replaced by 2le, the shortest pathways from s to any other node t are dynamic. As an alternative, consider a network with two nodes, s and t, and two directed edges, (s,t) and (t,s), each of which has weights le1 and le2. From point S to point T, the shortest route is along edge (s,t) with length le1, however if we double that value to get le2, the shortest route is along edge (t,s) with length 2*le2. Assuming D(u,v) is the shortest route from u to v in the original graph G, we can prove it explicitly. Let us call the resultant graph G', where the weights were all multiplied by 2, G. By definition, the shortest route is D(u,v), but if a path P in G' is shorter than D(u,v), then we can prove that there exists a path P' in G such that the length of P' is less than D(u,v). This leads us to the conclusion that the shortest pathways from s to any other node t are not fixed and may vary if the lengths are changed by 2le.
