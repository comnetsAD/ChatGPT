False. If the lengths of the edges were substituted with 2le, it's possible that the shortest pathways from node S to any other node T would shift. Take a look at the following graph with weights le applied to each edge e as an alternative example. +----1-—-+\s | |\ss +----2-—-+ t\s | |\s +——3——+ The route s->t, which has a length of one, is the quickest way to go from point s to point t. If, on the other hand, the lengths of the edges were changed to 2le, the shortest route would be s -> t, which would have a length of 2. Proof: The Dijkstra's shortest route method is used in order to locate the path that is the smallest distance between a single source and every other vertex. It makes use of a priority queue, which is really a min-heap data structure in its underlying implementation. The proximity of a vertex to its source vertex(es) serves as the determining factor for its position in the priority queue. The method picks the vertex v from the priority queue that has the least key on a repeating basis. It then changes the keys of all the vertices that are near to v by loosening the edge constraints (v,u). When we multiply all of the edge weights by a constant k, the distance from s to any vertex does not change; nevertheless, the key of the vertex in the priority queue will be multiplied by k after we do this operation. However, the minimum heap size attribute does not change; the vertex that was already the smallest before the multiplication will continue to be the smallest after the operation. Therefore, the shortest pathways from s to any other node t may shift in their configuration if the lengths of the edges are modified to have a value of 2le.
