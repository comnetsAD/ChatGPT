False. The shortest pathways from node s to any other node t remain unchanged when the lengths are substituted with 2le. The shortest route from s to t is the one with the smallest sum of edge weights. If all edge weights are multiplied by 2, the total of edge weights for each route will also be multiplied by 2. Due to the fact that multiplying a minimum value by a constant does not alter its minimum value, the new shortest route will continue to be the path with the smallest sum of edge weights. Counter-example: Consider a directed graph G with three nodes s, A, and t and two edges (s,A) and (A,t) with weights 2 and 1, respectively. (s,A,t) is the shortest route from s to t, having a distance of 3 units. Even if we change the weights with 22 = 4 and 21 = 2, the shortest route remains (s,A,t) with a distance of 6 units. It is essential to notice that this is only true if the weights are positive; negative weights might alter the shortest route.
