False. If the edge lengths are changed with 2le, the shortest pathways from node s to any other node t may alter. Consider the following graph in which weights le have been given to each edge e. +----1-—-+\s | |\ss +----2-—-+ t\s | |\s +——3——+ The shortest route from s to t has a length of 1 and is s -> t. However, if 2le is substituted for the lengths of the edges, the shortest route becomes s -> t with a length of 2. Proof: The Dijkstra shortest route method is used to determine the shortest path from a single source to every other vertex. It employs a prioritization queue that is implemented as a min-heap data structure. A vertex's priority queue key is its distance from the source vertex s. The method continually picks the vertex v with the shortest key from the priority queue and changes the keys of all neighboring vertices by relaxing the edges (v,u). When all edge weights are increased by a constant k, the distance from s to any vertex stays unchanged, but the key of the vertex in the priority queue is multiplied by k. The vertex that was originally the smallest will still be the smallest after the multiplication, since the min heap attribute is unaffected. Therefore, if the lengths of the edges are substituted with 2le, the shortest pathways from s to any other node t may vary.
