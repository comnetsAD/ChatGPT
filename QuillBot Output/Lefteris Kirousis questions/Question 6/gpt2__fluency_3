False. If the lengths are replaced by 2le, the shortest pathways from s to any other node t may alter. A graph with two nodes, s and t, and two directed edges, (s,t) and (t,s), with weights le1 and le2, might be used as an example. The shortest route from s to t is via the edge (s,t) with length le1, but if the length is multiplied by 2, the shortest path is through the edge (t,s) with length 2*le2. Formally, we may demonstrate it by assuming that D(u,v) is the shortest route from u to v in the original graph G. Let G' be the graph produced by multiplying all of the weights by 2. If a route P in G' is shorter than D(u,v), then we may prove that there exists a path P' in G whose length is smaller than D(u,v), which violates the definition of D(u,v). As a result, we may deduce that if the lengths are changed by 2le, the shortest routes from s to any other node t can vary.
