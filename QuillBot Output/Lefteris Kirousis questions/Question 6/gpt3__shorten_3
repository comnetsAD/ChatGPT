False. Replace the edge lengths with 2le to modify the shortest pathways from s to any other node t. Counterexample: The following graph has edge weights le. +----1-—-+\s | |\ss +----2-—-+ t\s | |\s +——3——+ The 1-length route from s to t is the shortest. Changing the edge lengths to 2le makes the shortest route s -> t with a length of 2. Proof: Dijkstra's shortest route algorithm finds the shortest path from one vertex to all others. It employs a min-heap priority queue. Distance from the source vertex s is the priority queue vertex key. The method continually picks the priority queue vertex with the least key and updates the keys of all nearby vertices by relaxing the edge (v,u). The distance from s to any vertex stays the same when we multiply all edge weights by a constant k, but the priority queue key will be multiplied by k. After multiplication, the smallest vertex stays the smallest because to the min heap feature. Thus, replacing edge lengths with 2le changes the shortest pathways from s to any other node t.
