False. No change occurs in the shortest pathways from s to any other node t if the lengths are replaced by 2le. Convincing evidence: a route from point s to point t is said to be "short" if its sum of edge weights is less than a certain threshold. If we increase the value of each edge weight by 2, the total edge weights of every possible route will also increase by 2. The new shortest route will still be the one with the lowest total edge weights since multiplying a minimum value by a constant has no effect on the minimum value. Counter-example: Let's say you have a directed graph G consisting of the three nodes s, A, and t and the two edges (s,A) with weight 2, and (A,t) with weight 1. The three-step sequence (s,A,t) is the quickest route from s to t. The shortest route remains (s,A,t) with a distance of 6 if the weights are changed to 22 = 4 and 21 = 2. However, this holds only if the weights are positive; if the weights are negative, the shortest route may shift.
