False. If the lengths are swapped out for 2le, the shortest routes from node s to any other node t may alter. A network with two nodes, s and t, and two directed edges, (s,t) and (t,s), with weights le1 and le2, respectively, may serve as a counterexample. If we increase the length by 2, the edge (t,s) with length 2*le2 would be the edge along which we could go from point s to point t in the smallest amount of time. By assuming that D(u,v) is the shortest route from u to v in the initial graph G, we may explicitly demonstrate it. Let G' be the graph created by multiplying all of the weights by 2 to create it from G. We may demonstrate that there is a route P' in G whose length is smaller than D(u,v), which goes against the idea that D(u,v) is the shortest path, if a path P in G' is shorter than D(u,v). Therefore, if the lengths are changed by 2le, the shortest pathways from node s to any other node t may vary.
