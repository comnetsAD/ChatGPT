False. If the lengths are replaced by 2le, the shortest pathways from s to any other node t remain unchanged. Proof: The shortest route from s to t is the one with the smallest sum of edge weights. When we multiply all edge weights by 2, the total of edge weights for all paths is also doubled by 2. Because multiplying a minimum value by a constant has no effect on its minimal value, the new shortest route will still be the one with the smallest sum of edge weights. Counter-example: Consider a directed graph G with three nodes s, A, and t and two edges (s,A) and (A,t) with weights of 2 and 1, respectively. With a distance of 3, the shortest route from s to t is (s,A,t). When the weights are changed to 22 = 4 and 21 = 2, the shortest route with a distance of 6 remains (s,A,t). It is crucial to note that this is only true if the weights are positive; if the weights are negative, the shortest route might vary.
