The counterexample demonstrates that the assertion is not always true. By taking into account f(n) = n2 and g(n) = n, a counterexample may be created. Given that f(n) = c1 * g(n) for c1 = 1 and n > n1 = 1, it is evident that f(n) is O(g(n)). But whereas log g(n) = log n, log f(n) = 2 log n As a result, log f(n) is not O(log g(n)), and 2 log n is not O(log n). While in other situations, such as when g(n) = n2 and f(n) = n3, log f(n) equals O(log g(n)), as log f(n) = 3 log n and log g(n) = 2 log n, respectively. It's important to note that the big O notation does not account for the base of the logarithm function and instead compares the growth rates of different functions.
