Is there a set of more than n/2 cards that are all equal to one another within the set of n cards, according to their query? Consider that your sole option for using the cards is to choose two of them and insert them into the equivalency tester. Give a linear time prune and search method that determines whether the majority of the cards are equal to one another and, if so, locates a representative of them (non-linear algorithms will not get credit). Starting with random pairings of the cards, remove one card from each pair if they are equivalent and both if they are not. Then, rigorously demonstrate that if the majority of the cards are equivalent, then the same is true of the cards that remain after the pruning, and in this case, the majority of equivalent cards in the remaining part corresponds to the majority of equivalent cards at the beginning. A thorough explanation of the method in everyday language is required (English). When n is odd, be sure to cover the caseâ€”how do you handle the mismatched card in this situation? A simple summary of the proofs won't do. The following is the method for fixing this issue: Start by arbitrarily matching the n bank cards. Use the bank's equivalency tester to check if each pair of bank cards is an exact match. If so, retain them both and go on to the next pair. Discard both cards if they are not. If there are still an odd number of cards after all pairings have been examined, throw away the mismatched card. Till there is no card left or just one, repeat procedures 2 and 3 as necessary. If there is just one card left, it reflects the preponderance of identical cards in the initial set of n cards. In the event that there are no more cards, there is no majority of identical cards in the first set of n cards. Proof: By demonstrating that if the majority of the cards in the initial collection of n cards are equal, then the majority of the cards that remain after the pruning process are likewise equivalent, we can demonstrate that the method is effective. The likelihood that two comparable cards will be paired together is the same as the probability that two non-equivalent cards will be placed together since the method randomly pairs the first n cards. After the pruning procedure, both cards in a pair that are equal will be preserved. Both cards will be discarded if two non-equivalent cards are matched together. As a result, the likelihood of discarding a card from the majority of comparable cards is the same as the likelihood of discarding a card from the minority of non-equivalent cards. The number of cards left will decrease when steps 2 and 3 are repeated. At the same pace as non-equivalent cards, the quantity of comparable cards will likewise decrease. This means that the ratio of equivalent to non-equivalent cards stays the same. There will still be n/2 cards after n/2 repetitions. The bulk of the remaining cards are identical since the ratio of equivalent to non-equivalent cards is the same as it was at the beginning. After the pruning operation, there will only be one mismatched card left if n is odd. We may reject the unpaired card without impacting the accuracy of the algorithm's conclusion since it is as likely to come from the majority of comparable cards as it is from the minority of non-equivalent cards. As a result, this approach can locate the vast majority of cards that are comparable in linear time.
