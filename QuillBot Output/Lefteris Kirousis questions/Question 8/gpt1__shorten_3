A linear time prune and search method discovers a representative of the majority of cards if they are equivalent: Set 'count' to zero and'representative' to the first card. Start iterating from the second card. Equivalence tester each card to the "representative" card. If the cards are equal, increase the "count" variable. Decrease 'count' by one if the cards are different. If the 'count' variable hits zero, set the'representative' variable to the current card and reset it to one. Repeat steps 3-6 for all collection cards. Return the "representative" card if the "count" variable is higher than zero after iterating through all cards. Return "None" if the "count" variable is 0 since there is no majority of identical cards. Proof: The method initializes the 'count' variable to zero and the'representative' variable to the first card in the collection. Starting with the second card, the equivalency tester compares each card to the "representative" card. If the two cards are comparable, we increase the 'count' variable by one, indicating that we located another card that is equivalent to the'representative' card. If the two cards are not equal, we reduce the 'count' variable by one to indicate that we identified a card that is not the'representative' card. If the current card is comparable to the "representative" card, the "count" variable will rise, decrease, or keep the same as we cycle over the cards. If the 'count' variable hits zero, the current card is not equal to the'representative' card and all previous cards that were equivalent have been wiped out by the non-equivalent cards, so we change the'representative' variable to the current card and reset the 'count' variable to one. The 'count' variable will be negative, zero, or positive as we cycle over the cards. The'representative' card reflects the majority of similar cards if the 'count' variable is positive. The 'count' variable will be negative, zero, or positive as we cycle over the cards. If 'count' is 0, we haven't discovered a majority of identical cards. If n is odd, the final card will be unmatched after the repetition. We'll verify whether the 'count' variable is larger than zero. If so, the "representative" card is most comparable cards. If not, we'll compare the final card to the "representative" card. If so, the "representative" card is most comparable cards. No majority of identical cards if not. This approach takes O(n) time since it iterates over the cards once and executes a constant number of actions for each card. If a majority of cards are equal, the algorithm prunes cards that are not equivalent to the "representative" card, leaving a majority of identical cards. Thus, the method will yield a representation of a majority of comparable cards in linear time.
