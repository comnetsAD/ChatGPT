They want to know whether there is a group of more than n/2 cards that are all comparable to one another in the deck of n. Assume that in order to use the equivalency tester, you must choose two cards at random and insert them into it. Make available a search and pruning method that runs in linear time and determines whether or not the majority of cards are comparable and, if so, chooses a representative (non-linear algorithms will not get credit). Assuming that the majority of the cards are equivalent, we can start by arbitrarily pairing them and then removing one card from each pair if they are equivalent and both if they are not. If the majority of the cards are equivalent, we can then rigorously prove that the same is true of the cards remaining after the pruning, and that the majority of equivalent cards in the remaining part represents the majority of equivalent cards at the start. An accurate, human-readable description of the algorithm is required (English). Take special care to account for the situation in which n is odd (how to deal with the unmatched card). A simple summary of the arguments is insufficient. Here is the method I used to get an answer to my question: To begin, randomly pair the n bank cards. Use the bank's card equivalency tester to compare each pair of cards and decide whether or not they are interchangeable. If so, retain both cards and continue with the following pair. If not, then put both cards in the discard pile. If there are an odd number of cards left after testing pairings, the extra one should be thrown out. Carry on with steps 2 and 3 until there is either one card left or none at all. If there is just one card left, it is a majority representative of the n original cards. There is no majority of identical cards in the original deck of n cards if all n cards have been discarded. That this method works may be shown by proving that if most of the cards in the initial set of n cards are comparable, then most of the cards that remain after the pruning procedure are also equivalent. As the method begins by randomly pairing the n cards, the chances of any two cards being paired together are the same regardless of whether they are comparable or not. After the culling process, both cards in a pair that are comparable to one another will be preserved. If a pair of dissimilar cards is made, both cards will be thrown away. Therefore, the odds of discarding a card from the larger set of equal cards are the same as the odds of discarding a card from the smaller set of non-equivalent cards. The number of remaining cards will decrease as we repeat steps 2 and 3. In the same way as the number of cards that are not comparable is being reduced, so too will the number of cards that are. Therefore, there is no change in the percentage of "equivalent" cards relative to "non-equivalent" cards. There will be n2/2 cards left after n repetitions. Since there are now more equivalent cards than non-equivalent cards, the original ratio of equivalent cards to non-equivalent cards has been preserved. If the number of cards to be culled is odd (n >= 0), then once the first selections have been made, there will be one unmatched card left. Since the mismatched card might come from either the vast majority of comparable cards or the tiny minority of non-equivalent cards, we can safely throw away the unmatched card without influencing the algorithm's output. As a result, the majority of identical cards may be found using this technique in linear time.
