Here is a linear-time search and pruning method that determines whether the majority of cards are comparable and, if so, selects a representative for them: Initialize the 'count' variable to zero and the'representative' variable to the first card in the collection. Beginning with the second card, iterate over the collection of cards. Utilizing the equivalency tester, compare each card to the'representative' card. If the two cards are equal, the 'count' variable is increased by one. If the two cards are not comparable, subtract one from the count variable. If the 'count' variable hits zero, assign the current card to the'representative' variable and reset the 'count' variable to one. Repeat steps 3-6 for each of the collection's cards. If the 'count' variable is higher than zero after iterating over all cards, return the'representative' card as a representation of the majority of comparable cards. If the 'count' variable is less than zero, return 'None' since there is no majority of identical cards. Proof: The 'count' variable is initialized to zero and the'representative' variable is initialized to the first card in the collection at the beginning of the procedure. As we cycle over the collection of cards, beginning with the second card, we use the equivalency tester to compare each card to the'representative' card. If the two cards are comparable, the 'count' variable is incremented by one to indicate that another card that is equivalent to the'representative' card has been discovered. If the two cards are not comparable, the 'count' variable is decremented by one to indicate that a card that is not equivalent to the'representative' card has been detected. As we continue to cycle over the collection of cards, the 'count' variable will rise, decrease, or remain constant based on whether the current card is comparable to the'representative' card. If the 'count' variable reaches zero, it indicates that the current card is not equivalent to the'representative' card and that all previous cards that were equivalent to the'representative' card have been cancelled out by the non-equivalent cards, so the'representative' variable is set to the current card and the 'count' variable is reset to one. The 'count' variable will be either negative, zero, or positive as we cycle over the collection of cards. If the 'count' variable is positive, it indicates that the majority of equivalent cards have been located, with the'representative' card representing the majority of equivalent cards. The 'count' variable will be either negative, zero, or positive as we cycle over the collection of cards. If the 'count' variable is 0, it indicates that a majority of identical cards have not been located. Upon completion of the iteration, the last card in the collection will be unmatched if n is an odd number. In this instance, we will determine if the variable 'count' is more than zero. If so, the'representative' card is the card with the largest number of analogous cards. Whether not, we shall determine if the final card is comparable to the "representative" card. If so, the'representative' card is the card with the largest number of analogous cards. If not, there is no majority of cards with the same value. In addition, the algorithm prunes cards that are not comparable to the'representative' card, and if the majority of cards are equivalent, the majority of equivalent cards will remain after pruning.
