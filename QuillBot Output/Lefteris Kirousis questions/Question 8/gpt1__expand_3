The following is an example of a search and pruning method that runs in linear time and determines whether or not the majority of cards are interchangeable, and if they are, locates a card that is representative of all of them: Set the value of the variable called 'count' to zero, and set the value of the variable called'representative' to the card that comes first in the collection. Proceed through the deck of cards beginning with the second one and working your way through the deck. Use the equivalency tester to do a comparison of each card to the card that will serve as the "representative." In the event when the two cards are interchangeable, the 'count' variable should be increased by one. If the two cards cannot be compared to one another, the 'count' variable should be decreased by one. In the event that the 'count' variable reaches zero, the'representative' variable is changed to the currently active card, and the 'count' variable is brought back up to one. It is necessary to repeat steps 3-6 for each of the cards in the collection. After going through all of the cards in the deck, if the 'count' variable has a value higher than zero, the'representative' card will be returned as the card that is most representative of the corresponding cards in the deck. If the 'count' variable does not equal or exceed zero, the value 'None' should be returned since there is no majority of cards with the same value. Proof: At the beginning of the algorithm, the 'count' variable is set to zero, and the'representative' variable is set to the first card in the collection. This demonstrates that the algorithm is working correctly. The equivalency tester is used to make a comparison between each card in the collection and the card that serves as the "representative" card as we work our way through the deck of cards beginning with the second card. If the two cards in question are interchangeable, we will add one to the 'count' variable to signify that we have discovered an additional card that is interchangeable with the card that has been designated as the "representative." We find a card that is not equal to the'representative' card when we reduce the 'count' variable by one. This indicates that we have discovered a card that is not equivalent to the card that is being used as a representative. The value of the 'count' variable will either rise, decrease, or remain the same as we continue to loop over the collection of cards. This change will be determined by the fact that the current card will either be equal to the'representative' card or will not be comparable to it. If the 'count' variable reaches zero, it indicates that the current card does not have the same value as the'representative' card. Since all of the cards that had previously been played that had the same value as the'representative' card have been cancelled out by the cards that do not have the same value, we assign the'representative' variable to the current card and reset the 'count' variable to one in this scenario. The 'count' variable will either have a negative value, be equal to zero, or have a positive value as we loop over the collection of cards. If the 'count' variable has a positive value, it indicates that we have found the majority of equivalent cards, and the'representative' card represents the majority of equivalent cards. If the 'count' variable has a negative value, it indicates that we have not found the majority of equivalent cards. The 'count' variable will either have a negative value, be equal to zero, or have a positive value as we loop over the collection of cards. If the "count" variable has a value of zero, it indicates that we have not located the majority of cards that are equal to one another. If n is an odd number, then after the iteration is finished, the card that is the last in the collection will not have a match. In this instance, we are going to check to see whether the 'count' variable has a value that is more than zero. If that's the case, the card that best represents the other cards is the one with the most number of votes. In the event that this is not the case, we shall proceed to determine whether or not the final card is equal to the card that is being referred to as the "representative." If that's the case, the card that best represents the other cards is the one with the most number of votes. In the event that this is not the case, there is no majority of cards that are similar. This particular approach has a time complexity of O(n) due to the fact that it only goes through the collection of cards one time and carries out the same number of operations on each card. In addition, the algorithm removes cards that are not comparable to the'representative' card. If the majority of cards are equivalent to one another, then the majority of equivalent cards will also be among the cards that are left after pruning has taken place. In this method, we are able to verify that the algorithm will, in linear time, deliver a representation of the majority of the cards that are comparable if the majority of the cards are equivalent.
