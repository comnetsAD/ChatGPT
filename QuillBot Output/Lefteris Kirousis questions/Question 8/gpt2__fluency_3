For this task, I would suggest a linear time prune and search method that employs a divide and conquer strategy. The algorithm's core concept is to randomly pair the cards and then use the equivalence tester to assess if the two cards in each pair are equal. If they are, we retain one and throw away the other. If they are not, both cards are discarded. We continue this method until we only have a few cards left. The algorithm's initial step is to partition the collection of n cards into pairs. If n is an odd number, we may simply couple the first n-1 cards and leave the last card unpaired. The equivalence tester is then used to verify whether the two cards in each pair are equal. If they are, we retain one and throw away the other. If they are not, both cards are discarded. We continue this method until we only have a few cards left. We now have a limited number of cards left, and we can use the equivalence tester to see whether they are all equal. If they are, we have discovered a collection of cards that are more than n/2 equal to one another. If they are not, we may deduce that no collection of more than n/2 cards is equal to each other. We may use a proof by contradiction to demonstrate that this method works. Assume the majority of cards are equal, but the method fails to locate a group of more than n/2 cards that are identical. This implies that the bulk of the cards were discarded during the trimming phase, which is illogical. As a result, if the majority of cards are comparable, the algorithm will discover a group of cards that are more than n/2 equal to one another. When n is odd, we simply couple the first n-1 cards and leave the last card unpaired. Whether we have an odd number of cards left after pruning, we can simply verify if the final card is comparable to the majority of the remaining cards. Because we only pair and test the cards once, this process is linear in time, and the number of remaining cards after pruning reduces with each iteration. Furthermore, owing to the divide and conquer strategy and the proof by contradiction, this algorithm is guaranteed to locate a representation of the majority of comparable cards, assuming they exist.
