I would suggest a linear time prune-and-search method that employs a divide-and-conquer strategy for this task. The fundamental concept of the method is to arbitrarily pair the cards and then use the equivalence tester to check if the two cards in each pair are equal. If they are, one card is kept and the other is discarded. If they are not, both cards are discarded. This procedure is repeated until only a tiny number of cards remain. In the first stage of the algorithm, the collection of n cards is divided into pairs. If n is an odd number, we may couple the first n-1 cards and leave the last card unpaired. Next, we utilize the equivalency tester to check whether each pair of cards is identical. If they are, one card is kept and the other is discarded. If they are not, both cards are discarded. This procedure is repeated until only a tiny number of cards remain. At this point, there are just a few cards left, and we can use the equivalence tester to see whether they are all equal. If they are, we have discovered a collection of more than n/2 cards that are identical. If this is not the case, we may infer that there is no collection of more than n/2 cards that are comparable. To demonstrate that this technique is effective, we may do a proof by contradiction. Assume that the majority of cards are comparable, but that the algorithm cannot locate a group of more than n/2 identical cards. This would indicate that the majority of cards were eliminated during the process of trimming, which is contradictory. Therefore, if the majority of cards are comparable, the algorithm will identify more than n/2 equivalent cards. In the event where n is an odd number, we couple the first n-1 cards and leave the final card unpaired. Whether, after thinning the deck, we are left with an odd number of cards, we may simply determine if the last card matches the majority of the remaining cards. This approach is linear in time since we only pair and test the cards once and the number of cards left after pruning reduces with each iteration. Due to the divide-and-conquer strategy and the proof by contradiction, this method is also guaranteed to locate a representative of the majority of comparable cards, if one exists.
