The algorithm's central tenet is to randomly pair up the cards and then use the equivalence tester to figure out whether or not the two cards in the pair are indeed equal. If so, we'll retain one of the cards and toss the other. If not, we have to toss both cards. This procedure is repeated until just a few cards remain. If the number of cards to pair is an odd number (n), we may leave the final card alone. Then, we put each set of cards through the equivalence tester to see whether there is any equivalence between them. If so, we will retain one of the cards and toss the other. In case they are not, we will have to get rid of both cards. We keep doing this until just a few cards remain. If not, then we know that no more than n2/2 sets of cards are equal to one another. A argument by contradiction may be used to show that this method is effective. Let's pretend that the vast majority of cards are interchangeable, but the algorithm can't come up with more than n2 sets of cards that are interchangeable. This contradicts the idea that the majority of cards were kept after the trimming procedure. When n is an odd number, we couple the first n-1 cards and discard the remaining card. Whether, after discarding some cards, we are still left with an odd number, we can quickly determine if the last card is the same as or nearly the same as the rest of the deck.
