Their inquiry is as follows: given the deck of n cards, is there a group consisting of more than n/2 cards that are all comparable to one another? Assume that the only practical thing you can do with the cards is to choose any two of them and then insert them into the equivalency tester. This is the only viable option. Provide a linear time prune and search method that, first, determines if the majority of the cards can be read as having the same value as one another, and then, if they can, locates a card that is a representation of the equivalent cards (non-linear algorithms will not get credit). Prove rigorously that if the majority of cards are equivalent, then the same is the case with the cards remaining after the pruning, and in this case, the majority of equivalent cards in the remaining part represents the majority of equivalent cards at the beginning. Start by pairing the cards in an arbitrary manner, and then from each pair, prune one card if they are equivalent and both if they are not. It is important that the method be precisely defined using normal language (English). Take special attention to prepare for the scenario in which n is an even number (how will you deal with the card that is missing a match in this scenario?). It is not sufficient to just provide a summary of the evidence. The following is an algorithm that may be used to solve this problem: To begin, pair the n bank cards in a manner that is completely random. Use the bank's equivalency tester on each set of bank cards to discover whether or not the two cards in the set are equal to one another. In the event that they are, you should retain both cards and go to the next pair. If none of these conditions is met, discard both cards. If there is an odd number of cards left after all possible pairings have been examined, you should get rid of the card that does not have a match. It is necessary to repeat procedures 2 and 3 until there is either a single card left or no cards left at all. In the event that just one card is left, it is considered to be representative of the majority of its counterparts in the initial collection of n cards. In the event that there are no cards left, the initial collection of n cards does not include a majority of cards that are identical to one another. The validity of this technique may be shown by demonstrating that if the vast majority of cards in the initial collection of n cards are comparable, then the vast majority of cards that are still in the collection after the pruning process are likewise equivalent. Because the method begins by randomly pairing the n cards with one another, the likelihood that two cards with the same value will be paired together is the same as the probability that two cards with different values will be paired together. After the process of pruning, both of the paired cards that are comparable to one another will be maintained in the deck. If two cards that are not comparable are paired together, then both of those cards will be discarded. Therefore, the likelihood of a card being rejected from the group that contains the majority of equivalent cards is the same as the probability of a card being discarded from the group that contains the minority of non-equivalent cards. As we continue to perform steps 2 and 3, the number of cards that are still available will gradually decrease. In addition, the number of cards that are comparable to one another will be lowered at the same pace as the number of cards that are not equivalent. Therefore, the ratio of comparable cards to non-equivalent cards has remained the same throughout. Following an amount of repetition equal to n/2, there will be n/2 cards left. Due to the fact that the ratio of equal cards to non-equivalent cards remains the same as it was at the beginning of the game, the vast majority of the cards that are still in play are equivalent. In the event that n is an odd number, the pruning procedure will result in the retention of one mismatched card. Due to the fact that the probability of the mismatched card coming from the majority of equivalent cards or the minority of non-equivalent cards is equal, we are able to get rid of the unmatched card without compromising the reliability of the algorithm's output by doing so. As a result, our approach is able to locate the vast majority of comparable cards in a linear amount of time.
