A linear-time search and pruning technique is shown below that determines whether a set of cards is equivalent and, if so, selects a single card to serve as a representative of the set. Set the value of the 'count' variable to zero and set the value of the'representative' variable to the first card in the deck. Repeat this process using the second card in the deck as the starting point. The equivalency tester is used to compare each card to the'representative' card. When comparing two cards, if they are equal, the 'count' variable should be increased by 1. Reducing the 'count' variable by one if the two cards are not interchangeable. Set the'representative' variable to the currently active card and re-initialize the 'count' variable to one if it ever reaches zero. All of the cards should go through steps 3-6 again. If the 'count' variable is non-zero after iterating through all cards, then the'representative' card should be returned to stand in for the majority of comparable cards. There is no majority of identical cards, hence you should return "None" if the count variable is less than or equal to 1. This is shown by the fact that the 'count' variable starts at zero and the'representative' variable always points to the first card in the deck. The equivalency tester is used to compare each card in the deck to the'representative' card in a series of iterations beginning with the second card. If the two cards are interchangeable, then we know that we have located another card that is equal to the'representative' card, and we may increase the 'count' variable by one. If the two cards are not comparable, we indicate that we have identified a card that is different from the representative card by subtracting one from the 'count' variable. If the current card in the collection is comparable to the representative card, then the 'count' variable will grow by one; otherwise, it will drop by one. If the count reaches zero, it means that the current card is not equivalent to the representative card, and that any previous cards that were equivalent to the representative card have been cancelled out by the non-equivalent cards; in this case, we set the'representative' variable to the current card and reset the 'count' variable to one. The 'count' variable will take on negative, zero, or positive values as we cycle through the deck of cards. Having discovered a majority of comparable cards (a positive value for the count variable) allows us to say that the'representative' card is representative of that group. The 'count' variable will take on negative, zero, or positive values as we cycle through the deck of cards. A value of 0 for the count variable indicates that we have not located a sufficient number of matching cards. If n is an odd number, the last card in the deck will remain unmatched when the iteration is finished. Here, we'll see whether the 'count' variable is more than zero. In such case, the'representative' card would be the one that most closely matches the others. In any other case, we'll see whether the final card is the same as the'representative' card. In such case, the'representative' card would be the one that most closely matches the others. In the alternative, there is no majority of identical cards. Due to the fact that this method only has to execute a fixed number of actions on each card, its time complexity is O(n). In addition, the algorithm removes any cards that aren't an exact match for the'representative' card, so if the majority of cards are comparable, the set that's left after pruning will be made up of mostly matches. This guarantees that the method will, in linear time, provide a card that is reflective of the majority when a set of cards is comparable.
