A linear time prune and search method that determines if the majority of cards are identical to one another and, if they are, identifies a representative of them is given below: Set the values of the variables "count" and "representative" to 0 and the first card in the collection, respectively. Repeat the process beginning with the second card in the deck. Use the equivalency tester to compare each card to the "representative" card. Add one to the "count" variable if the two cards are equal. Reduce the "count" variable by one if the two cards are not equal. Set the "representative" variable to the current card and reset the "count" variable to one if the "count" variable reaches zero. For all the cards in the collection, repeat steps 3-6. If the 'count' variable is higher than zero after iterating over all of the cards, return the'representative' card as a representation of the majority of comparable cards. Return "None" because there are no cards that make up the majority of the count if it is less than zero. Proof: The 'count' variable is initialized to zero at the beginning of the procedure, and the'representative' variable is initialized to the first card in the collection. Starting with the second card in the collection of cards, we iteratively compare each card to the "representative" card using the equivalence tester. If the two cards match, we increase the "count" variable by one to show that we have discovered a second card that matches the "representative" card. The 'count' variable is decremented by one if the two cards are not equal, signifying that we have discovered a card that is not comparable to the'representative' card. The 'count' variable will either rise, decrease, or remain constant when we cycle over the collection of cards, depending on whether the current card is comparable to the'representative' card or not. We set the'representative' variable to the current card and reset the 'count' variable to one if the 'count' variable decreases to zero, which indicates that the current card is not equivalent to the'representative' card and that all previous cards that were equivalent to the'representative' card have been cancelled out by the non-equivalent cards. The 'count' variable will either be negative, zero, or positive as we cycle through the deck of cards. The majority of comparable cards have been located, and the "representative" card reflects the majority of equivalent cards, if the "count" variable is positive. The 'count' variable will either be negative, zero, or positive as we cycle through the deck of cards. If the 'count' variable is 0, we have not discovered a majority of cards that are comparable. The last card in the collection will be unmatched at the end of iteration if n is odd. In this instance, we will determine whether the variable "count" is more than zero. If so, the majority of identical cards constitute the "representative" card. Whether it isn't, we'll see if the final card is comparable to the "representative" card. If so, the majority of identical cards constitute the "representative" card. If it isn't, there isn't a majority of cards that are similar. Because it only makes one pass over the collection of cards and applies a fixed number of operations to each card, this approach has an O(n) time complexity. In addition, the method eliminates cards that are not equal to the "representative" card; if the majority of the remaining cards are also a majority of comparable cards, the algorithm will not prune the non-equivalent cards. By doing this, we can guarantee that the algorithm will deliver a representation of that majority in a linear amount of time if the majority of the cards are comparable.
