I would suggest a linear time prune and search method for this issue, which employs a divide and conquer strategy. The algorithm's fundamental principle is to randomly pair the cards before using the equivalence tester to check if the two cards in each pair are identical. If so, we retain one card and throw away the other. If not, both cards are discarded. We keep doing this until there are just a few cards left. The method begins by splitting the collection of n cards into pairs. In the event when n is odd, we may just couple the first n-1 cards and leave the last card alone. The two cards in each pair are then tested to see whether they are equal using the equivalence tester. If so, we retain one card and throw away the other. If not, both cards are discarded. We keep doing this until there are just a few cards left. We only have a few cards left at this point, and we can use the equivalence tester to see whether or not they are all equal. If so, we have discovered a group of cards that are equal to one another in more ways than two. If not, we may say that no collection of more than n/2 cards can be said to be comparable to one another. We may use a demonstration by contradiction to demonstrate that the algorithm is effective. Assume that the majority of cards are identical, but that the algorithm is unable to identify a collection of more than n/2 identical cards. This contradicts the idea that most of the cards were eliminated during the trimming procedure. The method will thus discover a collection of more than n/2 cards that are equal to one another if the majority of cards are equivalent. We simply couple the first n-1 cards and leave the final card unpaired to accommodate the situation when n is odd. If there are still an odd number of cards after the cards have been pruned, we can quickly determine if the last card is comparable to the majority of the remaining cards. Since we only pair and test the cards once, and since there are fewer cards left after pruning with each iteration, this technique is linear in time overall. Due to the divide and conquer strategy and the proof by contradiction, this method is also guaranteed to discover a representation of the majority of comparable cards, if they exist.
