Here is a linear time prune and search method that determines whether the majority of cards are equal to one another and, if so, picks a representative of them: Set the variable 'count' to zero and the variable'representative' to the collection's first card. Iterate through the deck of cards, beginning with the second card. Using the equivalency tester, compare each card to the'representative' card. If the two cards are equal, add one to the 'count' variable. If the two cards are not equal, decrease the variable 'count' by one. Set the'representative' variable to the current card and reset the 'count' variable to one if the 'count' variable reaches zero. Steps 3-6 should be repeated for each card in the collection. If the 'count' variable is higher than zero after iterating over all cards, return the'representative' card as a representation of the majority of comparable cards. If the variable 'count' is less than zero, return 'None' since there is no majority of identical cards. Proof: The 'count' variable is set to zero at the start of the algorithm, and the'representative' variable is set to the first card in the collection. We use the equivalency tester to compare each card to the'representative' card as we cycle through the collection of cards, beginning with the second card. If the two cards are comparable, we add one to the 'count' variable, indicating that we have discovered another card that is equivalent to the'representative' card. If the two cards are not comparable, we subtract one from the 'count' variable, indicating that we have discovered a card that is not equivalent to the'representative' card. As we cycle over the collection of cards, the 'count' variable will either rise, decrease, or remain constant based on whether the current card is equal or not to the'representative' card. If the 'count' variable falls to zero, it means that the current card is not equivalent to the'representative' card and that all previous cards that were equivalent to the'representative' card have been cancelled out by the non-equivalent cards, so we set the'representative' variable to the current card and reset the 'count' variable to one. The 'count' variable will be either negative, zero, or positive as we cycle over the collection of cards. If the 'count' variable is positive, we have discovered a majority of equivalent cards, and the'representative' card represents the majority of comparable cards. The 'count' variable will be either negative, zero, or positive as we cycle over the collection of cards. If the 'count' variable is 0, we have not discovered a majority of identical cards. If n is odd, the final card in the collection will remain unmatched when the iteration is finished. In this scenario, we will see whether the variable 'count' is more than zero. If so, the'representative' card represents the majority of comparable cards. Whether it isn't, we'll see if the final card is comparable to the'representative' card. If so, the'representative' card represents the majority of comparable cards. If it is not, there is no majority of identical cards. Because it iterates over the collection of cards once and executes a fixed number of actions on each card, this method has a temporal complexity of O(n). Furthermore, the algorithm prunes cards that are not comparable to the'representative' card, and if the majority of cards are equivalent, the surviving cards after pruning will be a majority of equivalent cards as well. As a result, if a majority of cards are comparable, the method will deliver a representation of that majority in linear time.
