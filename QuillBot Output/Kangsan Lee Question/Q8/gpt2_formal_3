The IDE in entrepreneurship stands for "Concept Development Entrepreneur" and refers to a person who develops a fresh company idea into a profitable firm. Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise, on the other hand, refers to a firm that is generally independently owned and run, with a relatively small number of workers and limited resources. Both IDE and SME are significant in the realm of entrepreneurship since they represent distinct phases of the company development process and play a critical role in fostering innovation and economic success.
