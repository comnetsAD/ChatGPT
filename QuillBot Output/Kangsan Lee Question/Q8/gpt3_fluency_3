The initial development entrepreneur (IDE) is the individual who comes up with the original idea or concept for a new company. They usually have a thorough awareness of the business and sector in which they operate and can see chances for new goods or services. Small and Medium Enterprises, or SME, are enterprises that are generally smaller in size and employ fewer people than bigger organizations. These companies often operate in narrow areas and are able to adjust swiftly to market developments. The IDE and SME both play critical roles in the entrepreneurship ecosystem, with the IDE bringing new ideas to market and the SME promoting innovation and development within their respective sectors.
