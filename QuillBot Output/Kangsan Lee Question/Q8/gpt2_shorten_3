An "IDE" is a "Concept Development Entrepreneur" who develops a new company idea. The "Small and Medium-sized Enterprise" (SME) is often independently owned and run, with a small number of workers and minimal resources. IDE and SME represent distinct phases of company development and drive innovation and economic progress in entrepreneurship.
