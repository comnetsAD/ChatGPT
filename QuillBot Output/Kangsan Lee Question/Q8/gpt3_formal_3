Initial Development Entrepreneur (IDE) refers to the individual who develops the first idea or concept for a new company. Typically, they have a solid grasp of the market and sector in which they operate and may find chances for new goods or services. Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) refers to firms that are generally smaller in size and employ fewer workers than major enterprises. These firms often operate in narrow markets and are able to swiftly adjust to market developments. Both the IDE and SME play significant roles in the ecosystem of entrepreneurship, with the IDE bringing new ideas to market and the SME promoting innovation and development within their respective sectors.
