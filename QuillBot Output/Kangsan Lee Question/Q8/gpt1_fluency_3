The IDE is a someone who is responsible for recognizing new business possibilities, creating innovative goods or services, and leading the development of a new venture. The SME is an individual who is responsible for guiding the growth of a new enterprise. In contrast, a SME is a firm that is generally smaller in size and scope than a huge corporation. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are regarded as the backbone of many economies since they provide employment, contribute to economic development, and drive innovation. Both the IDE and the SME play critical roles in the entrepreneurial ecosystem and are essential for any economy's development and growth.
