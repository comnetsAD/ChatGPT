"Innovative Development Entrepreneur" (IDE) and "Small and Medium Enterprises" (SME) are two terms used in the context of entrepreneurship. The IDE is the person often tasked with finding new business possibilities, creating novel goods and services, and overseeing the company's expansion. Alternatively, a small to medium-sized enterprise (SME) is any company that is not as huge as a multinational organization. Many countries look on small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) as their primary source of employment, economic development, and innovation. There is no way for an economy to thrive and flourish without the contributions of both the innovative de novo enterprise and the small and medium enterprise.
