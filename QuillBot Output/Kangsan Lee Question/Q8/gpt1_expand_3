The term "Innovative Development Entrepreneur" (IDE) is used in the context of entrepreneurship, and the term "Small and Medium Enterprises" (SME) refers to businesses that fall into one of two categories: either very small or very large. The IDE is typically an individual who is responsible for identifying new business opportunities, developing innovative products or services, and leading the growth of a new venture. When compared to a huge company, a small and medium-sized enterprise (often abbreviated as SME) generally has fewer employees and operates on a less extensive scale. Because they are responsible for the creation of employment, the expansion of the economy, and the acceleration of innovation, small and medium-sized businesses are sometimes referred to as the "backbone" of their respective economies. The independent development organization (IDE) and the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) both play crucial roles in the entrepreneurial ecosystem and are essential to the success and growth of any economy.
