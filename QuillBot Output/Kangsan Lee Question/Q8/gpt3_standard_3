First Development Entrepreneur, or IDE in entrepreneurship, refers to the individual who develops the initial idea or concept for a new firm. They are often adept at seeing chances for new goods or services because they have a thorough awareness of the market and sector in which they operate. Small and medium-sized firms, sometimes known as SMEs, are generally less big than larger organizations and employ fewer people. These companies can swiftly adjust to market changes since they often operate in narrow areas. The IDE introduces novel ideas to the market, while the SME propels innovation and expansion within their respective sectors. Both the IDE and SME play significant roles in the entrepreneurial ecosystem.
