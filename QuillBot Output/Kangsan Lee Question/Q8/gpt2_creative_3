"Idea Development Entrepreneur" (or "IDE") is shorthand for a person who creates a novel company concept and then works to grow it into a profitable firm. Alternatively, a SME (which stands for "Small and Medium-sized Enterprise") is a company that is often privately owned and run, has a small number of workers, and operates with little resources. When it comes to the importance of entrepreneurship, it's hard to choose between IDEs and SMEs, since both play a pivotal role in propelling innovation and economic growth but at different points in the company development process.
