The term "Concept Development Entrepreneur" (IDE) in entrepreneurship refers to a person who generates a fresh company idea and strives to develop it into a profitable firm. The SME, on the other hand, is an acronym for "Small and Medium-sized Enterprise" and refers to a company that is often privately held, independently run, has a small staff, and has little resources. Due to the fact that they represent various phases of the company development process and are essential for promoting innovation and economic success, IDE and SME are both significant in the area of entrepreneurship.
