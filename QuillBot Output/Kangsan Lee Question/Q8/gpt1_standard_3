The terms "Small and Medium Enterprises" (SME) and "Innovative Development Entrepreneurs" (IDE) are used in the field of entrepreneurship. The IDE is typically a person who is in charge of finding new business opportunities, developing novel products or services, and overseeing the expansion of a new venture. As opposed to a major company, a SME is a kind of business that is generally smaller in size and scope. SMEs are regarded as the foundation of many economies since they provide employment, economic development, and innovation. The development and expansion of any economy depend on both the IDE and the SME, both of which have significant responsibilities to play in the entrepreneurial ecosystem.
