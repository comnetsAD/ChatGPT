The term "idea development entrepreneur" (often abbreviated as "IDE") refers to a person who conceives of a novel concept for a company and works to cultivate it into a profitable enterprise. The IDE is the first step in the entrepreneurial process. The term "Small and Medium-sized Enterprise," on the other hand, refers to a company that is often independently owned and controlled, with a very small number of workers and limited resources. SME is an abbreviation for "Small and Medium-sized Enterprise." Both innovative disruptive enterprises (IDEs) and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are significant in the realm of entrepreneurship due to the fact that they represent distinct phases of the process of business development and play an essential part in the process of driving economic growth and innovation.
