The term "initial development entrepreneur" (often abbreviated as "IDE") refers to the company founder who is responsible for conceiving the original thought or plan behind a brand-new enterprise. They often have a solid grasp of the industry in which they are working as well as the market in which they are functioning, and they are able to see prospects for new goods or services. The term "Small and Medium Enterprise" (often abbreviated as "SME") refers to companies that, in comparison to bigger firms, are generally less extensive and employ a smaller workforce. These companies often serve specialized customer bases and are nimble enough to respond rapidly to changes in the marketplace. The innovative disruptive enterprise (IDE) and the small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) each play an important role in the ecosystem of entrepreneurship, with the IDE being responsible for bringing new ideas to the market and the SME being responsible for driving innovation and growth within their respective industries.
