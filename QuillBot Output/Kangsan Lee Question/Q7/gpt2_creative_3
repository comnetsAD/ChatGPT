Other forms of intellectual property include copyrights and trademarks. A trademark is any distinctive sign, term, or phrase that a business uses to set its goods and services apart from the competition. Registration of a trademark with the government confers exclusive legal protection on the owner with respect to the use of the trademark in connection with the owner's products or services. Authoritative works like books, songs, and computer programs are safeguarded by copyrights. The owner of a copyright is granted the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, publicly exhibit, and adapt the original work.
