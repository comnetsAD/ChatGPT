Trademarks and copyrights are two more categories of intellectual property. A trademark is a sign, word, or phrase that identifies and differentiates one party's products or services from those of another. Trademarks are often used to safeguard brand names, logos, and slogans. In contrast, copyrights protect creative works of authorship such as books, music, movies, and software. They provide the creators the only right to reproduce, distribute, and exhibit their work for a certain amount of time. Trademarks and copyrights are both legally enforceable and may be registered for further protection.
