Copyrights and trademarks are two more forms of intellectual property. A trademark is a sign, term, or phrase used to identify and differentiate the source of products or services from those of other parties. Typically, trademarks are intended to protect brand names, logos, and slogans. In contrast, copyrights protect creative works of authorship such as books, music, films, and software. They provide authors the sole right to reproduce, distribute, and exhibit their work for a certain time period. Copyrights and trademarks are both legally enforceable and may be registered for further protection.
