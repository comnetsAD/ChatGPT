Trademarks and copyrights are two more categories of intellectual property. A trademark is a sign, word, or phrase that is used to identify and differentiate the goods or services of one firm from those of its rivals. Trademarks may be registered with the government, granting the owner the exclusive right to use the mark in connection with their products or services. In contrast, copyrights protect original works of authorship such as books, music, and software. The owner of a copyright has the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, and exhibit the work, as well as to develop derivative works.
