Copyrights and trademarks are two more forms of intellectual property that may be acquired. A trademark may be a word, symbol, or phrase that identifies and differentiates the origin of products or services from those of other parties. Trademarks can be registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). It is common practice to use trademarks in order to safeguard brand names, logos, and slogans. The protection of creative works of authorship, such as books, music, movies, and software, is the responsibility of the copyright system. They provide the creators the exclusive right to duplicate, disseminate, and exhibit their work for a certain amount of time. Copyrights and trademarks are two types of intellectual property that are legally enforceable and may be registered for extra layers of protection.
