Copyrights and trademarks are two more forms of intellectual property that are often used. A trademark may be a term, symbol, or phrase that is used to identify and differentiate a business's goods or services from those of the companies that the firm competes with in the market. It is possible to register trademarks with the government, which will provide the owner the exclusive right to use the mark in connection with the products or services that they provide. On the other hand, copyrights serve to safeguard the original versions of works of authorship such as books, songs, and computer programs. The owner of a copyright is granted the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, and exhibit an original work, as well as the right to create works that are derivative of the original.
