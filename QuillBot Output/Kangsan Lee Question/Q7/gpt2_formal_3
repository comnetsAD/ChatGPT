Other forms of intellectual property include copyrights and trademarks. A trademark is a sign, word, or phrase used to identify and differentiate the goods or services of one firm from those of its rivals. Government registration of trademarks grants the owner exclusive rights to use the mark in relation to their products and services. In contrast, copyrights protect original works of authorship such as books, music, and software. A copyright grants the owner exclusive reproduction, distribution, and exhibition rights, as well as the ability to create derivative works.
