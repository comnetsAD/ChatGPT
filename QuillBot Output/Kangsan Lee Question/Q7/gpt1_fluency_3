Trademarks and copyrights are two more categories of intellectual property. Trademarks are symbols, logos, or phrases that are used to identify and differentiate a firm or product in the market from others. Copyrights safeguard the rights of authors and musicians who create original works such as books, music, and films. They provide authors the exclusive right to reproduce, distribute, and exhibit their work. To give legal protection against infringement, both trademarks and copyrights may be registered with the government.
