The trademark and copyright categories of intellectual property are two more. Trademarks are words, phrases, or symbols that are used to identify and set one business or product apart from another in the marketplace. Authors of creative works, such as books, music, and movies, are protected by copyrights. They provide creators the exclusive right to duplicate, distribute, and exhibit their works. Government registration is possible for both copyrights and trademarks to provide legal defense against infringement.
