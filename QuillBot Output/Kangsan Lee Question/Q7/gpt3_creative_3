Other forms of IP include copyrights and trademarks. A trademark might be a logo, slogan, or catchphrase that shows consumers who made a particular product. Brand names, logos, and slogans are often protected by trademarks. Contrarily, copyrights serve to safeguard literary, musical, cinematic, and software creations. For a limited time, creators are granted the only right to duplicate, disseminate, and exhibit their work. Copyrights and trademarks are both enforced by law and may be registered for further security.
