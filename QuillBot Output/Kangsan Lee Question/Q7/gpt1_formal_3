Copyrights and trademarks are two more forms of intellectual property. Symbols, emblems, or phrases used to identify and differentiate a firm or product from others on the market are trademarks. Copyrights safeguard the rights of authors, composers, and filmmakers of creative works such as books, songs, and films. Creators are granted the sole right to reproduce, distribute, and exhibit their work. The government may register both trademarks and copyrights to give legal protection against infringement.
