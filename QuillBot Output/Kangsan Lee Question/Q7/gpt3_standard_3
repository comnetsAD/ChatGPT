The trademark and copyright categories of intellectual property are two more. A trademark is a picture, word, or phrase that identifies and sets one company's products apart from those of another. To protect company names, logos, and catchphrases, trademarks are often employed. While original works of authorship like books, music, movies, and software are protected by copyrights. For a certain amount of time, they provide artists the only right to reproduce, distribute, and exhibit their works. Copyrights and trademarks may both be registered to further strengthen legal enforcement and protection.
