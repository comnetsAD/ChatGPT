The two further categories of intellectual property are copyrights and trademarks. A trademark is a design, word, or phrase that identifies and sets one company's goods or services apart from those of other businesses. The government may register trademarks, which grants the owner the only right to use the mark in connection with their products or services. Contrarily, copyrights safeguard creative works of art like music, software, and novels. Exclusive reproduction, distribution, and exhibition rights as well as the ability to develop derivative works are granted by a copyright to the owner.
