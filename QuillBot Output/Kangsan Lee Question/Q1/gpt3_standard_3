A partnership between a lender and an entrepreneur is referred to as a "mudharabah partnership" in Islamic law. In this arrangement, the entrepreneur runs the company while the financier supplies the funding. The financier receives a certain part of the profit, and the entrepreneur receives the remaining percentage, according to a pre-determined ratio. The funder is not responsible for any damages the company suffers, however. Any losses are the exclusive responsibility of the Entrepreneur and must be made up from their own portion of the earnings or personal assets. This kind of relationship fosters risk sharing and moral corporate conduct.
