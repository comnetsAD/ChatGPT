A mudharabah partnership is defined in Islamic law as a collaboration between a lender and an entrepreneur. The financier provides the funds in this relationship, while the entrepreneur oversees the enterprise. Profits are divided according to a predetermined ratio, with the financier getting a certain amount of profits and the entrepreneur receiving the remainder. The entrepreneur, on the other hand, takes the risk of loss and is not accountable for any losses experienced by the firm. In contrast, in a typical partnership, all partners share earnings and losses equally.
