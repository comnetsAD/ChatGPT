A financier-entrepreneur cooperation is called mudharabah in Islamic law. The financier funds the firm and the entrepreneur runs it. The financier receives a pre-agreed part of the profit, while the entrepreneur receives the rest. The financier is not liable for company losses. The entrepreneur must cover losses from their share of earnings or personal assets. This alliance fosters risk-sharing and ethical business practices.
