A collaboration between a lender and an entrepreneur is known as a mudharabah partnership under Islamic law. In this arrangement, the investor contributes funds while the entrepreneur operates the firm. According to a predetermined ratio, the financier receives a specific part of the profit, while the entrepreneur receives the remaining amount. However, the lender is not responsible for any losses sustained by the firm. The entrepreneur is fully liable for any losses and must compensate for them out of his or her part of the earnings or personal assets. This form of collaboration fosters risk-sharing and ethical corporate conduct.
