A mudharabah partnership is the name given by Islamic law to a business arrangement that includes both a financial backer and a business owner. In this kind of commercial relationship, the funding is provided by the financier, but the firm itself is managed by the entrepreneur. The profit is split in accordance with a ratio that has been previously agreed upon, with the financier getting a predetermined part of the total profit and the business owner receiving the remaining percentage. However, the lender is not responsible in any way for any losses that may be experienced by the company. If there is a loss of any kind, it is entirely the responsibility of the entrepreneur, who must make up for it out of their own part of the earnings or their own personal assets. This kind of collaboration supports ethical business practices and fosters risk-sharing among the parties involved.
