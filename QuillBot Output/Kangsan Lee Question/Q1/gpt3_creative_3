A monetary and business relationship is known as a mudharabah under Islamic law. The investor offers financial backing, while the firm owner assumes operational responsibility. According to the agreed upon profit split, the investor will get a certain portion of the total, while the business owner will keep the rest. However, the lender is not responsible for the company's financial misfortunes. If the business incurs losses, the owner is liable for making up the difference out of his or her own money or assets. Partnerships like this promote risk-sharing and moral behavior in the workplace.
