A collaboration between a lender and an entrepreneur is known as a mudharabah partnership under Islamic law. In this partnership, the funding is provided by the financier, while the firm is managed by the entrepreneur. The profit is split in accordance with a predetermined ratio, with the financier getting a certain amount and the entrepreneur receiving the remainder. However, the entrepreneur carries the risk of loss and is not responsible for commercial losses. In contrast to a typical partnership, in which all partners participate in both profits and losses, all partners in a limited liability company partake in neither.
