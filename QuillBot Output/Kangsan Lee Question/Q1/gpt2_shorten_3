A financier-entrepreneur cooperation is called mudharabah in Islamic law. The financier finances the enterprise, while the entrepreneur operates it. The lender receives a certain part of the earnings and the entrepreneur the rest, according to a pre-agreed ratio. The lender pays for any losses, not the entrepreneur. The financier trusts the entrepreneur to run the firm, and the entrepreneur uses their abilities to make money for both sides.
