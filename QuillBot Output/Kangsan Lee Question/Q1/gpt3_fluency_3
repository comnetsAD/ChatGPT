A mudharabah partnership is defined in Islamic law as a collaboration between a lender and an entrepreneur. The financier provides the funds in this relationship, while the entrepreneur oversees the enterprise. The profit is divided according to a predetermined ratio, with the financier getting a certain amount and the entrepreneur receiving the remainder. The financier, on the other hand, is not liable for any losses suffered by the firm. Any losses are completely the responsibility of the entrepreneur, who must make up the difference from their own part of the earnings or personal assets. This form of collaboration fosters risk-sharing and ethical business practices.
