A mudharabah partnership is defined in Islamic law as a collaboration between a lender and an entrepreneur. The financier provides the funding for the company enterprise, while the entrepreneur oversees and operates it. The profit is split evenly between the financier and the entrepreneur, with the financier getting a predetermined portion of the earnings and the entrepreneur receiving the remainder. If there is a loss, however, the lender takes the whole loss and the entrepreneur is not accountable. The financier entrusts the entrepreneur with the administration of the firm, while the entrepreneur uses their talents and knowledge to produce profits for both sides.
