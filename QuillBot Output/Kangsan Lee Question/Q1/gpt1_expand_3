A mudharabah partnership is the name given by Islamic law to a business arrangement that includes both a financial backer and a business owner. In this kind of business relationship, the entrepreneur is in charge of running the company while the financier is responsible for providing the necessary funds. The financier will get a certain part of the earnings, and the entrepreneur will receive the remaining percentage after the profit has been split according to a ratio that has been previously agreed upon. However, the risk of loss is with the entrepreneur, and the business owner bears no responsibility for any losses sustained by the company. In contrast to this, a typical partnership requires all partners to contribute equally to both the earnings and the losses of the business.
