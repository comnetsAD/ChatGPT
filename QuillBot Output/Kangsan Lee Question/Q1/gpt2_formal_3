A collaboration between a lender and an entrepreneur is known as a mudharabah partnership under Islamic law. In this sort of collaboration, the financier provides the capital for the business initiative, while the entrepreneur oversees and operates the enterprise. The profit is split between the investor and the entrepreneur in accordance with a predetermined ratio, with the investor getting a set proportion and the entrepreneur receiving the remaining percentage. However, if there is a loss, the whole loss is borne by the financier and the entrepreneur is not responsible. This sort of partnership is founded on mutual confidence and collaboration, with the financier entrusting the entrepreneur with the administration of the firm and the entrepreneur using their talents and knowledge to produce profits for both sides.
