A monetary and business relationship is known as a mudharabah under Islamic law. It's a sort of partnership where the investor contributes capital and the company owner handles day-to-day operations. Financier and entrepreneur agree on a predetermined profit split, with the lender getting a certain proportion and the latter receiving the remaining earnings. If a loss occurs, however, it is borne entirely by the financier; the business owner is held harmless. The investor has faith in the entrepreneur to run the firm and the entrepreneur uses the investor's capital to grow the company, creating a win-win situation for everyone involved.
