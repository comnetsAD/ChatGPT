A partnership between a lender and an entrepreneur is referred to as a "mudharabah partnership" in Islamic law. In this kind of cooperation, the entrepreneur oversees and maintains the firm while the financier provides the capital for the initiative. A pre-determined ratio is used to divide the earnings between the financier and the entrepreneur, with the financier getting a predetermined proportion and the entrepreneur receiving the remainder. But in the event of a loss, the financier is responsible for covering the whole loss and the business owner is exempt. With the financier entrusting the entrepreneur with the administration of the firm and the entrepreneur employing their talents and knowledge to produce profits for both sides, this sort of partnership is founded on mutual confidence and collaboration.
