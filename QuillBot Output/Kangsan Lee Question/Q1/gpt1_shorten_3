A financier-entrepreneur cooperation is called mudharabah in Islamic law. The financier funds the firm while the entrepreneur runs it. The financier receives a pre-agreed part of the earnings, while the entrepreneur receives the rest. The entrepreneur assumes risk and is not accountable for company losses. In contrast, typical partnerships share earnings and losses.
