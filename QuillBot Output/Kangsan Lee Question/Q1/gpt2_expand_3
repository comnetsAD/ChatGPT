A mudharabah partnership is the name given by Islamic law to a business arrangement that includes both a financial backer and a business owner. In this kind of business partnership, the financier is the one who provides the capital for the new business endeavor, while the entrepreneur is the one who is in charge of managing and operating the company. The profit is split between the entrepreneur and the financier in accordance with a ratio that was previously agreed upon, with the financier getting a predetermined part of the profits and the entrepreneur receiving the remaining percentage of the earnings. On the other hand, the financier is fully responsible for any losses that occur, and the business owner has no responsibility or liability in this regard. The financier will entrust the entrepreneur with the administration of the firm, and the entrepreneur will use their talents and knowledge to produce profits for both sides as part of this form of partnership. This type of partnership is founded on the principles of mutual trust and collaboration.
