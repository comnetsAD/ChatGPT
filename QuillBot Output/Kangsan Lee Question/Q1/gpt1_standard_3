A partnership between a lender and an entrepreneur is referred to as a "mudharabah partnership" in Islamic law. In this relationship, the financier supplies the money while the company owner runs the enterprise. The financier receives a certain part of the earnings, and the entrepreneur receives the remaining amount, according to a pre-determined ratio. However, the business owner assumes all loss risk and is not responsible for any damages suffered by the company. In contrast, in a typical partnership, all partners split the gains and losses equally.
