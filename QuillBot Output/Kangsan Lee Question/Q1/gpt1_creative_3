A monetary and business relationship is known as a mudharabah under Islamic law. To put it simply, the investor gives the funds and the entrepreneur is in charge of running the show. An agreed-upon part of the earnings are given to the investor, while the remaining portion is given to the business owner. However, the business owner is responsible for any losses, and the company is not accountable for the owner's losses. The partners in a classic partnership split the gains and losses equally.
