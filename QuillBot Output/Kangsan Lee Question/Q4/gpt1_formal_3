According to Stuart and Sorenson, the likelihood of initial public offerings (IPOs) by biotech companies is determined by the availability of venture capital in a location and the existence of a cluster of comparable enterprises in that region. They discovered that places with a high concentration of venture capital tend to have a greater possibility of biotech businesses going public, because venture capital firms are more inclined to invest in biotech firms with a greater potential of going public. In addition, they discovered that regions with a cluster of similar biotech firms tend to have a greater likelihood of biotech firms going public, as the presence of a cluster of firms in a similar industry can lead to increased collaboration and knowledge sharing, which can increase the likelihood of success for individual firms.
