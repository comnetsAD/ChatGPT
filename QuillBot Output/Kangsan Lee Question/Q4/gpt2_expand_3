According to the findings of Stuart and Sorenson, the likelihood of initial public offerings (IPOs) for biotechnology companies is affected by two factors: the accessibility of venture capital and the concentration of research institutes. They discovered that the presence of venture capital firms in an area improves the chance of a biotech company going public. This is because venture capital businesses offer the cash that is essential for biotech companies to develop and market their products. Additionally, the concentration of research institutions in a region is another factor that increases the likelihood of a biotech company going public. This is because research institutions provide the necessary knowledge and expertise for biotech companies to develop and commercialize their products. The availability of venture capital and the concentration of research institutions are significant determinants of the regional distribution of entrepreneurial activity in the biotechnology sector, as the authors conclude overall.
