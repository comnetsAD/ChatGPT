According to Stuart and Sorenson, proximity to scientific and technical hubs and closeness to finance centers impact the chance of IPOs for biotech companies. They discovered that biotech businesses situated near scientific and technical hubs, such as universities and research organizations, were more likely to go public because these areas give access to resources and networks. In addition, biotech enterprises situated near financial hubs, such as large cities with a high concentration of venture capital firms and investment banks, were more likely to go public since they had access to the cash required to finance their development and expansion. Overall, the authors believe that proximity to both scientific and technical hubs and financial centers has a significant impact on the likelihood of a biotechnology company going public.
