According to Stuart and Sorenson, the availability of venture financing and the concentration of research institutes have an impact on the likelihood that biotech companies will go public. They discovered that the existence of venture capital firms in an area increased the probability of a biotech company going public since these companies provide biotech companies the financing they need to develop and market their products. A biotech company is also more likely to go public if there is a concentration of research institutions in the area since these institutions provide biotech companies the information and experience they need to develop and market their products. Overall, the authors draw the conclusion that the geographic distribution of entrepreneurial activity in the biotech sector is largely influenced by the availability of venture capital and the concentration of research institutes.
