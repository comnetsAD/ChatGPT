Stuart and Sorenson claim that biotech IPOs are affected by businesses' geographical proximity to both major research universities and major finance hubs. There was a correlation between proximity to scientific and technical hubs (such universities and research institutes) and the likelihood of a biotech business going public. In addition, biotech companies that were situated in big cities with a high concentration of financial institutions like venture capital firms and investment banks were more likely to go public. The authors conclude that a biotech company's likelihood of going public is significantly affected by its location in close proximity to both scientific and technology hubs and finance centers.
