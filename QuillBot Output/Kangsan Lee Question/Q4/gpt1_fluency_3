According to Stuart and Sorenson, two variables impact the likelihood of biotech IPOs: the availability of venture capital in an area and the existence of a cluster of comparable enterprises in that location. They discovered that places with a high concentration of venture capital had a greater chance of biotech businesses going public, since venture capital firms are more inclined to invest in biotech firms that are more likely to go public. Furthermore, they discovered that regions with a cluster of similar biotech firms have a higher likelihood of biotech firms going public, as the presence of a cluster of firms in a similar industry can lead to increased collaboration and knowledge sharing, which can improve individual firms' chances of success.
