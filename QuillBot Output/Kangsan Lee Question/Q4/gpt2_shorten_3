Stuart and Sorenson say venture capital and research institution concentration affect biotech IPOs. They concluded that venture capital companies boost the chance of a biotech business going public because they support product development and commercialization. The concentration of research institutions in an area also boosts the possibility of a biotech business going public, since these universities supply the information and experience needed to create and market goods. The authors argue that biotech entrepreneurial activity is driven by venture funding and research institution concentration.
