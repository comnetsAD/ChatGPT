According to Stuart and Sorenson, two variables increase the likelihood of biotech IPOs: proximity to scientific and technology hubs and proximity to finance centers. They discovered that biotech businesses situated near scientific and technical hubs, such as universities and research organizations, were more likely to go public because these areas give access to resources and networks. Furthermore, biotech enterprises situated near financial hubs, such as large cities with a high concentration of venture capital firms and investment banks, were more likely to go public since they had access to the funding required to support their development and expansion. Overall, the authors contend that proximity to both scientific and technology hubs as well as financial centers is critical in determining the likelihood of a biotech business going public.
