According to Stuart and Sorenson, the availability of venture financing and the concentration of research institutes impact the likelihood of IPOs for biotech companies. They discovered that the presence of venture capital firms in an area improves the chance of a biotech company going public, since these businesses offer the cash essential for biotech companies to develop and market their technologies. Additionally, the concentration of research institutions in an area improves the possibility of a biotech company going public, since these institutions supply the information and skills essential for biotech companies to develop and market their products. The authors argue that the availability of venture capital and the concentration of research institutions are major determinants of the geographical distribution of entrepreneurial activity in the biotechnology sector.
