According to Stuart and Sorenson, the likelihood of initial public offerings (IPOs) for biotech companies is affected by two factors: the accessibility of venture capital in an area and the existence of a cluster of enterprises that are comparable to one another in that location. They discovered that locations that have a high concentration of venture capital tend to have a greater chance of biotech businesses going public. This is due to the fact that venture capital firms are more inclined to invest in biotech firms that have a higher potential of going public. In addition, they discovered that areas with a concentration of biotech companies that are similar to one another tend to have a higher probability of biotech companies going public. This is due to the fact that the presence of a concentration of companies operating in a similar industry can lead to increased collaboration and knowledge sharing, both of which can improve the chances of success for individual companies.
