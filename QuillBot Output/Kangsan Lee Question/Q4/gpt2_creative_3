Stuart and Sorenson claim that the availability of venture financing and the density of research institutions are two variables that affect the likelihood of initial public offerings (IPOs) of biotech enterprises. Since venture capital firms supply the financing that biotech companies need to develop and market their technologies, the researchers discovered that their presence in an area increased the probability that a biotech business would go public there. Since research institutes supply the information and experience needed for biotech businesses to develop and market their products, their concentration in an area also boosts the chance of a biotech company going public. The authors conclude that the geographic distribution of entrepreneurial activity in the biotech sector is mostly determined by the accessibility of venture capital and the concentration of research institutes.
