The availability of venture funding and the concentration of research institutes, according to Stuart and Sorenson, impact the likelihood of biotech IPOs. They discovered that the presence of venture capital companies in an area improves the chance of a biotech business going public since these firms provide biotech firms with the required funds to develop and market their technologies. Furthermore, the concentration of research institutions in an area improves the possibility of a biotech business going public, since these universities supply biotech companies with the essential information and experience to develop and market their products. Overall, the authors suggest that venture capital availability and the concentration of research institutions are important determinants of the regional distribution of entrepreneurial activity in the biotech business.
