According to Stuart and Sorenson, the likelihood of initial public offerings (IPOs) for biotechnology companies is affected by two factors: the businesses' closeness to centers of scientific and technical activity, as well as their proximity to centers of financial activity. They discovered that biotech companies that were situated in close proximity to scientific and technological centers, such as universities and other types of research institutions, had a higher probability of going public as a result of the access to resources and networks that these centers make available. In addition, biotech companies that were located near financial centers, such as major cities that had a significant presence of venture capital firms and investment banks, had access to the capital that was necessary to fund their growth and expansion, which increased the likelihood that these companies would go public. The authors contend that the likelihood of a biotechnology company going public is significantly increased by being located in close proximity to both centers of scientific and technical activity and centers of finance activity.
