Stuart and Sorenson claim that proximity to financial centers and to scientific and technical hubs both affect the likelihood of IPOs for biotech companies. They discovered that because of the access to resources and networks that these locations provide, biotech businesses situated close to scientific and technical hubs, such as universities and research organizations, were more likely to go public. Additionally, since they had access to the resources required to finance their development and expansion, biotech companies situated close to financial hubs, such as those in significant cities with a high concentration of venture capital firms and investment banks, were more likely to go public. Overall, the authors contend that a biotech company's likelihood of going public is greatly influenced by its closeness to financial, scientific, and technical hubs.
