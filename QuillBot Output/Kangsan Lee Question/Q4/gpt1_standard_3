The availability of venture financing in an area and the existence of a cluster of businesses that are comparable to one another in that location, according to Stuart and Sorenson, have an impact on the likelihood that biotech companies will go public. They discovered that since venture capital companies are more inclined to invest in biotech businesses that have a greater potential of going public, locations with a high concentration of venture capital tend to have a higher probability of biotech firms going public. Additionally, they discovered that areas with a concentration of related biotech businesses tend to have a higher likelihood of having biotech businesses go public. This is because the presence of a cluster of businesses in a similar sector can foster greater collaboration and knowledge sharing, which can increase the likelihood of success for individual businesses.
