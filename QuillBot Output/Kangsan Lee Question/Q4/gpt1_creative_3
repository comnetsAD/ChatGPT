Two variables, according to Stuart and Sorenson, affect the likelihood of initial public offerings (IPOs) for biotech companies: the accessibility of venture capital in a location and the existence of a cluster of comparable enterprises in that region. They discovered that venture capital firms are more inclined to invest in biotech companies that have a greater potential of going public, hence locations with a high concentration of venture capital tend to have a higher probability of biotech businesses going public. The presence of a cluster of firms in a similar industry can lead to increased collaboration and knowledge sharing, which can improve the chances of success for individual firms, which may explain why they found a higher likelihood of biotech firms going public in regions with a cluster of similar biotech firms.
