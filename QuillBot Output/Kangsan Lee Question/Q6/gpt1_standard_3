The greatest strategy for brand-new IT start-ups to target both the Chinese and Islamic markets would be to carry out in-depth market research and customize their goods and services to fit the unique requirements and preferences of each market. Cultural and language variations, as well as regional laws and compliance standards, are two important elements to take into account. To better understand the industry and to build brand recognition and credibility, it would also be advantageous to form partnerships or collaborations with regional firms and organizations. A strong online presence and the use of digital marketing techniques may also be efficient ways to target these audiences.
