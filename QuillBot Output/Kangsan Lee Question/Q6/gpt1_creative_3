If a tech startup wants to break into the Islamic and Chinese markets, it has to first learn what those customers want and then adapt its goods and services accordingly. As well as the language and cultural barriers, local laws and compliance standards must be taken into account. To further your grasp of the industry and build your brand's trust, it would be wise to form alliances or collaborate with local firms and organizations in each area. Having a robust online presence and using digital marketing methods may also help you target these consumers.
