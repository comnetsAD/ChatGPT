Conducting extensive market research and tailoring one's goods and services to fit the individual requirements and preferences of each market is the strategy that will serve new IT-based start-up businesses best in their efforts to target the Islamic market as well as the Chinese market. Differences in culture and language, as well as adherence standards and rules specific to the area, are two essential aspects to take into consideration. Establishing alliances or collaborations with local firms and organizations in each market would also be good for gaining a better knowledge of the market as well as increasing brand recognition and credibility. This would be advantageous for both parties involved. In addition, having a powerful presence online and making great use of digital marketing methods might be an efficient way to approach these target audiences.
