An IPO or acquisition enables shareholders and investors to sell their shares and get a return on their investment. Even if the original creator may still be operating the firm, they may sell part or all of their shares during the event, which might be considered an exit. Liquidity events may also shift the company's ownership and management, allowing the founder to leave. Liquidity events allow owners and investors to depart the firm and profit.
