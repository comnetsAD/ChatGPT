Even if the original founder is still running the business, a liquidity event, such an IPO or a sale of the firm, may be seen as an exit for them since it enables them to monetize their ownership and possibly reap large financial advantages. Furthermore, a liquidity event may indicate a substantial change in the company's ownership and management, perhaps giving the original founder less influence over business decisions. Additionally, after a liquidity event, the firm can come under additional scrutiny and pressure to satisfy the financial needs of public shareholders, which might shift the organization's aims and emphasis. Regardless of whether the original founder still runs the business, a liquidity event may be a crucial turning point for both them and the firm as a whole.
