Because it enables shareholders and investors in a business to liquidate their shares and obtain a return on their investment, a liquidity event, such as an initial public offering (IPO) or purchase, may be regarded an exit for those shareholders and investors in the firm. Even if the original creator may still be operating the firm, they may decide to sell part or all of their own shares during the event, which might be considered an exit for them as well. This may be regarded as a positive development for the company. A liquidity event may also bring about substantial changes to the ownership structure and management of a firm, which can be considered as a type of departure for the original creator of the organization. In general, one might consider a liquidity event to be an exit since it gives shareholders and investors the option to get their money out of the firm and gain a return on their investment at the same time.
