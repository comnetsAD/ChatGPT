A liquidity event, such as an initial public offering (IPO) or a sale of the firm, may be considered an exit for the original founder, even if they continue to operate the business, since it enables them to monetize their share and possibly reap substantial financial advantages. In addition, a liquidity event might signify a substantial change in the ownership and control of the firm, giving the original founder possibly less decision-making authority and a diminished involvement in the company's development. In addition, following a liquidity event, the firm may face heightened scrutiny and pressure to generate financial returns to public shareholders, which may result in a shift in the organization's focus and goals. Whether or whether the original founder continues to operate the business, a liquidity event may be a key turning moment for the founder and the business as a whole.
