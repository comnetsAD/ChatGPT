Even if the original founder remains at the helm of the firm after an IPO or sale, they will have effectively "exited" the business if they are able to realize considerable value from their shares via a liquidity event such as these. When a company's founder experiences a liquidity event, it often indicates a major change in the company's ownership and control, which might mean less say in the company's future. In addition, after a liquidity event, the company's focus and goals may shift as it comes under more scrutiny and pressure to generate financial returns to public shareholders. Whether or whether the original founder stays on as the company's leader, a liquidity event may be a watershed moment for both the creator and the business.
