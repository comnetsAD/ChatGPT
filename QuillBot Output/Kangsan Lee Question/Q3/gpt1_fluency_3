Even if the original founder continues to operate the firm, a liquidity event, such as an IPO or a sale of the company, may be seen as an exit since it enables them to monetize their ownership and possibly reap considerable financial advantages. Furthermore, a liquidity event might indicate a substantial change in the company's ownership and control, possibly providing the original founder less decision-making authority and a lessened involvement in the company's development. Furthermore, after a liquidity event, the firm may face heightened scrutiny and pressure to generate financial returns to public shareholders, which may result in a shift in the company's focus and goals. Overall, regardless of whether the original founder continues to operate the firm, a liquidity event may be a key turning moment for the original founder and the company as a whole.
