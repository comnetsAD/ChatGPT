A liquidity event, such as an IPO or purchase, may be seen of as an exit for the company's owners and investors since it enables them to sell their shares and obtain a return on their investment. Even if the original founder is still in charge of the firm, they may opt to sell part or all of their own shares at the event, which may be seen as an exit for them as well. A liquidity event may also result in major changes to the company's ownership structure and management, which might be seen as a type of departure for the original founder. Overall, a liquidity event may be seen of as an exit since it allows shareholders and investors to depart the firm and obtain a return on their investment.
