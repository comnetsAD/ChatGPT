Even if the original founder is still operating the firm, a liquidity event, such as an IPO or purchase, may be deemed a departure since it enables them to monetize their ownership share in the company. This means they may turn their equity into cash, giving them financial stability and the opportunity to seek other opportunities. A liquidity event also represents an important milestone in the company's growth and development, and might indicate a change in the company's direction and goals. Overall, a liquidity event may be seen as an exit for the original creator since it enables them to enjoy the benefits of their hard work and devotion while also introducing new prospects and possibilities.
