A liquidity event, such as an initial public offering (IPO) or purchase, may be regarded an exit for shareholders and investors of a firm since it enables them to sell their shares and obtain a return on their investment. Even if the original founder is still operating the business, they may opt to sell part or all of their shares during the event, which may be seen as an exit for them as well. In addition, a liquidity event might result in substantial changes to the company's ownership structure and management, which can be seen as a departure for the original founder. In general, a liquidity event may be regarded an exit since it affords shareholders and investors the chance to depart the firm and obtain a return on their investment.
