For shareholders and investors in a firm, an exit might occur when a liquidity event (such as an IPO or purchase) occurs that enables them to sell their shares for a profit. Even if the company's original creator is still in charge, they may opt to make their own departure by selling some or all of their shares during the event. It is possible that a founder may leave a firm after a liquidity event since it results in major changes to the company's ownership structure and management. In general, a liquidity event may be thought of as an exit since it allows shareholders and investors to get their money out of the firm.
