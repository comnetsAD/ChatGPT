Even if they continue to run the company, an original founder may be considered to have "exited" the business upon the occurrence of a liquidity event such as an initial public offering (IPO) or the sale of the company. This is because the event enables the original founder to monetize their equity and potentially obtain significant financial rewards. A liquidity event may also signify a substantial change in the ownership and management of the firm, which may result in the original founder having less authority to make decisions and a lessened involvement in determining the path the company takes. Additionally, following a liquidity event, the firm may be exposed to heightened scrutiny and pressure to give financial returns to public shareholders. This may result in a shift in the company's focus and goals as a direct result of the increased scrutiny and pressure. In the grand scheme of things, a liquidity event may be a key turning point not just for the original founder but also for the firm as a whole, and this can be the case regardless of whether or not the original founder continues to operate the company.
