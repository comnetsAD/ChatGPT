The pressures that propel people to launch their own businesses or to explore entrepreneurship are referred to as push and pull factors. Push factors are the unfavorable features of a person's present circumstances that prompt them to launch their own firm, such as discontent with their existing position or a lack of prospects for professional progression. Pull factors, on the other side, are the advantages of entrepreneurship that draw people to it, including the possibility of financial gain, independence, and the capacity to follow one's passion. Push and pull variables work in tandem to significantly influence a person's choice to launch their own company.
