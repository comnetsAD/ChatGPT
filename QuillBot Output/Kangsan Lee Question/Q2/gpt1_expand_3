The term "push and pull factors" refers to the pressures that encourage people to establish their own businesses or to pursue other forms of entrepreneurial endeavors. Push factors are the negative aspects of an individual's current situation that motivate them to start their own business, such as dissatisfaction with their current job or a lack of career advancement opportunities. These push factors can motivate an individual to take action and start their own company. Pull factors, on the other side, are the positive features of entrepreneurship such as the possibility for financial gain, autonomy, and the chance to follow one's passion that draw people to the venture. The combination of elements that operate as pulls and pushes is an important component in determining whether or not a person will launch their own company.
