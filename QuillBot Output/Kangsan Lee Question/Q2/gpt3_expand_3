The term "push and pull factors" refers to the reasons why a person would want to begin their own company or become an entrepreneur. Push factors are the reasons that push a person away from conventional work, such as discontent with a present job or the desire for greater autonomy. Pull factors are the reasons that pull an individual toward traditional employment. Pull factors, on the other side, are the reasons that entice a person to entrepreneurship. Some examples of pull factors are the possibility of monetary success or the opportunity to be one's own boss. These aspects, taken as a whole, have the potential to sway an individual's choice to pursue entrepreneurship and may have an effect on the level of success or failure that a company achieves.
