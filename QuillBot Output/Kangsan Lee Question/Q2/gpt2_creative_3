The reasons that either encourage or discourage a person to launch their own company are known as "push" or "pull" factors. Dissatisfaction with one's existing job or a want for financial autonomy are examples of push factors that might motivate a person to launch a company. However, pull considerations, like the possibility of huge earnings or the freedom to choose one's own schedule and work hours, are what ultimately sway a person to take the plunge and launch their own firm. When deciding to establish a company, it's important to weigh the pull and push elements that influence a person's choice to take the entrepreneurial plunge.
