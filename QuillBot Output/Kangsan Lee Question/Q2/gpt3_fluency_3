The reasons why a person may want to establish their own firm or become an entrepreneur are referred to as push and pull considerations. Dissatisfaction with one's existing work or a desire for greater autonomy are examples of push factors. Pull factors, on the other side, are the reasons that entice a person to become an entrepreneur, such as the possibility of financial success or the chance to be one's own boss. These elements, when considered together, may affect an individual's choice to pursue entrepreneurship and play a role in a business's success or failure.
