The push and pull factors are the motivations that motivate people to establish their own firm or explore entrepreneurship. Push factors are the unfavorable characteristics of an individual's existing circumstances, such as discontent with their current employment or lack of professional growth chances, that inspire them to start their own firm. Pull factors are the positive qualities of entrepreneurship that attract people, such as the possibility for financial gain, autonomy, and the opportunity to follow one's passion. Together, push and pull forces have a significant impact on a person's choice to establish a company.
