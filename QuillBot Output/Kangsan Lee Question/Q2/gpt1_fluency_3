The motivations that motivate people to create their own businesses or pursue entrepreneurship are referred to as push and pull factors. Push factors are unfavorable features of a person's existing circumstance that encourage them to establish their own company, such as discontent with their current employment or a lack of prospects for professional progression. Pull factors, on the other side, are the attractive features of entrepreneurship, such as the possibility for financial gain, autonomy, and the chance to follow one's passion. Push and pull variables work together to shape an individual's choice to establish their own company.
