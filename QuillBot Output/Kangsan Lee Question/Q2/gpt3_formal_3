Push and pull factors relate to the reasons why a person may decide to establish his or her own firm or become an entrepreneur. Drive factors are the causes that push a person away from regular work, such as job discontent or a desire for more autonomy. Pull factors, on the other side, include the possibility for financial success and the opportunity to be one's own boss. These characteristics may impact an individual's choice to pursue entrepreneurship and play a role in a business's success or failure.
