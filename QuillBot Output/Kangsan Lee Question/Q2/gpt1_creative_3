The causes that encourage or discourage people from becoming entrepreneurs are sometimes referred to as "push" or "pull" factors. Negative characteristics of one's existing condition, or "push factors," such as discontent with one's employment or a lack of prospects for promotion, might drive a person to take the plunge into entrepreneurship. However, the good features of entrepreneurship, such as financial gain, independence, and the opportunity to follow one's passion, are what lure many to the field. Individuals' decisions to go into business for themselves are heavily influenced by both push and pull influences.
