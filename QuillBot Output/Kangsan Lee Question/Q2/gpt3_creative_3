Individuals have a variety of motivating factors—both internal and external—to pursue self-employment or entrepreneurship. Dissatisfaction with one's existing job or a desire for more independence are examples of push factors that might motivate an employee to leave a conventional workplace. In contrast, pull factors are those that entice a person to take the plunge into entrepreneurship, such as the chance for financial gain or the independence from reporting to anybody but oneself. All of these things taken together may have an impact on whether or not a person chooses to go into business for themselves, and on whether or not that firm succeeds.
