The push and pull factors are the things that encourage or deter someone from beginning their own company. Push factors are things like unhappiness with one's existing job or a desire for financial independence that motivate someone to launch their own company. Pull factors, on the other side, are those that draw someone to establishing their own company, such the possibility of large earnings or the freedom to work for themselves. When beginning a company, push and pull factors should be taken into account since they both have an impact on an individual's choice to become an entrepreneur.
