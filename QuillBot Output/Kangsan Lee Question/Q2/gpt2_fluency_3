The causes that motivate or discourage a person from beginning their own company are referred to as push and pull forces. Dissatisfaction with existing work or a desire for financial independence are examples of push factors that motivate people to establish their own businesses. Pull factors, on the other side, are those that entice a person to establish their own company, such as the possibility of big earnings or the freedom to be their own boss. Both push and pull factors influence an individual's desire to become an entrepreneur and should be considered when launching a new venture.
