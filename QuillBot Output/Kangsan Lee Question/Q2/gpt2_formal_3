The push and pull factors are the causes that motivate or dissuade a person from launching their own company. Individuals are motivated to start their own company by push factors, such as discontent with their existing position or a desire for financial independence. Pull factors, on the other side, are those that entice a person to establish a company, such as the possibility for big earnings or the freedom to be their own boss. A person's desire to become an entrepreneur is influenced by both push and pull forces, which should be addressed while launching a firm.
