The author contends that rather than using a structural or institutional perspective, the most accurate way to characterize Chinese capitalism is as a "hybrid capitalism." This indicates that the Chinese economic system combines characteristics of both a market economy and a planned economy, with the government having a substantial role in guiding and controlling the development of the economy in China. The hybrid approach permits a balance of private enterprise and state intervention, with the government utilizing market mechanisms to achieve its economic goals while also maintaining control over key industries and sectors. The hybrid approach allows for a balance of private enterprise and state intervention. Because the government is able to modify its level of engagement and intervention in accordance with the requirements, this strategy also enables a higher degree of flexibility in reacting to economic opportunities and problems. Overall, the hybrid capitalism strategy enables a one-of-a-kind combination of market forces and government supervision, which has been essential to China's economic success in recent years. This achievement may be attributed to the hybrid capitalism approach.
