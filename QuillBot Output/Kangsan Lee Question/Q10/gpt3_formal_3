In the "hybrid capitalism" perspective, the author contends that the best way to characterize Chinese capitalism is as a mix of governmental involvement and market forces. This strategy emphasizes the government's involvement in influencing the economy and the connections between state-owned and private firms. Rather than concentrating merely on structural issues like as GDP growth or labor markets, it emphasizes the need of comprehending the distinctive institutional arrangements and rules that have permitted China's economic progress. This viewpoint underlines that Chinese capitalism is unique from Western models and cannot be completely comprehended from a merely market-based or institutional vantage point.
