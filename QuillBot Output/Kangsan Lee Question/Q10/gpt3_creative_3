Chinese capitalism, the author contends under the "hybrid capitalism" perspective, is best understood as a blend of governmental involvement and market forces. In this view, the government plays a central role in influencing the economy and there is an emphasis on the relationships between state-owned and private companies. Instead of concentrating merely on structural issues like GDP growth or labor markets, it emphasizes the necessity of understanding the distinctive institutional arrangements and rules that have permitted China's economic progress. The authors argue that a strictly market-based or institutionalist lens fails to capture the nuances that make Chinese capitalism unique from its Western counterpart.
