In contrast to a structural or institutional view, the author proposes that the best way to characterize Chinese capitalism is as a "hybrid capitalism." Since the government plays such a pivotal role in guiding and directing economic development in China, the country's economic structure combines features of both a market economy and a planned economy. The government uses market processes to accomplish its economic objectives while simultaneously keeping control over critical industries and sectors under the hybrid model, which provides for a balance between private industry and state involvement. Since the government may vary its degree of engagement and intervention as required, this method also provides more flexibility in reacting to economic difficulties and opportunities. The success of China's economy in recent years may be attributed in large part to the country's adoption of a hybrid capitalism strategy that allows for a unique combination of market forces and government control.
