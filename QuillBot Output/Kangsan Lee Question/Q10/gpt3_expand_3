The originator of the theory known as "hybrid capitalism" contends that the most accurate way to characterize Chinese capitalism is as a mix of governmental involvement and the forces of the market. This strategy places an emphasis on the role that the government plays in sculpting the economy as well as the relationships that exist between state-owned corporations and private companies. It highlights the importance of understanding the unique institutional arrangements and regulations that have enabled China's economic development, rather than focusing solely on structural factors such as GDP growth or labor markets. This is because it is the understanding of these institutional arrangements and regulations that have enabled China's economic development. This approach highlights that Chinese capitalism is unique from Western models and that it cannot be completely understood via a viewpoint that is just market-based or institutional. Rather, it must be understood through a combination of these two lenses.
