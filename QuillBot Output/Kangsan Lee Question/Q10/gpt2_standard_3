Because Chinese capitalism incorporates characteristics of both state-controlled and market-oriented systems, the author contends that it is best characterized as a "hybrid capitalism." A structural or institutional approach, in contrast, would categorize Chinese capitalism entirely based on its formal institutions and structures, such as state control of important businesses and a dearth of democracy. Instead, the hybrid approach examines how these formal institutions interact with free markets and unofficial institutions, taking into account things like how state-owned firms affect the economy and how guanxi networks affect how businesses operate. This method enables a more nuanced understanding of the intricate nature and development of Chinese capitalism.
