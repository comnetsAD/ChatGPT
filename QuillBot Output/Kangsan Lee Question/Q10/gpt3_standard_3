According to the "hybrid capitalism" theory, Chinese capitalism is best characterized as a synthesis of governmental involvement and market forces. This strategy focuses on how the government influences the economy and how state-owned companies interact with private companies. It emphasizes the need of comprehending the distinctive institutional configurations and legal frameworks that have facilitated China's economic development rather than only concentrating on structural elements like GDP growth or labor markets. This method highlights how different Chinese capitalism is from Western models and how it cannot be completely comprehended from a solely market- or institutional-based viewpoint.
