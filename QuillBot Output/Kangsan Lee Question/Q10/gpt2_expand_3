The author contends that the most appropriate term for the kind of capitalism practiced in China is "hybrid capitalism," since it incorporates aspects of both state-controlled and market-oriented systems. This approach is in contrast to a structural or institutional approach, which would classify Chinese capitalism solely based on its formal institutions and structures, such as state ownership of key industries and a lack of democracy. In contrast, this approach takes into account the informal institutions and structures that exist in Chinese capitalism. Rather than focusing on how these formal institutions interact with market dynamics and informal institutions, the hybrid approach examines the function that state-owned companies play in the economy as well as the effect that guanxi networks have on business practices. A deeper and more nuanced knowledge of the complexity and development of Chinese capitalism is made possible by this method.
