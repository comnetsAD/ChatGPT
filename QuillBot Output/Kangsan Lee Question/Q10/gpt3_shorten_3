The author calls Chinese capitalism "hybrid capitalism" since it combines governmental involvement and market forces. This strategy emphasizes government influence on the economy and state-owned enterprise-private company relations. It emphasizes the necessity of understanding China's distinctive institutional arrangements and rules that have supported economic development, rather than just structural issues like GDP growth or labor markets. This approach highlights that Chinese capitalism differs from Western models and cannot be completely understood from a market-based or institutional viewpoint.
