According to the "hybrid capitalism" paradigm, Chinese capitalism is best understood as a blend of governmental involvement and market forces. This method focuses on the government's involvement in molding the economy as well as the relationships between state-owned firms and private businesses. It emphasizes the necessity of comprehending the distinct institutional arrangements and rules that have permitted China's economic development, rather than concentrating exclusively on structural issues like as GDP growth or labor markets. This approach underlines the fact that Chinese capitalism differs from Western models and cannot be completely comprehended via a solely market-based or institutional lens.
