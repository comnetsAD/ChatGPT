The author contends that the best way to characterize Chinese capitalism is as a "hybrid capitalism" as opposed to a structural or institutional approach. This indicates that the Chinese economic system has features of both a market economy and a planned economy, with the government having a major role in guiding and directing economic progress. The hybrid method permits a balance between private industry and government action, with the government employing market processes to accomplish its economic objectives while retaining control over critical industries and areas. As a result of the government's ability to change its degree of participation and intervention in response to economic difficulties and opportunities, this strategy also permits better responsiveness to economic issues and opportunities. The hybrid capitalism model provides for a unique combination of market forces and government supervision, which has been essential to China's recent economic success.
