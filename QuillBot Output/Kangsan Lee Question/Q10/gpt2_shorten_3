The author calls Chinese capitalism "hybrid capitalism" since it blends state-controlled and market-oriented systems. This contrasts with a structural or institutional approach, which would categorize Chinese capitalism exclusively on its formal institutions and structures, such as state control of major businesses and absence of democracy. The hybrid method examines how formal institutions interact with market pressures and informal institutions, such as state-owned firms and guanxi networks. This method illuminates Chinese capitalism's intricacies and development.
