According to the author, Chinese capitalism is best defined as "hybrid capitalism," since it incorporates features of both state-controlled and market-oriented systems. A structural or institutional approach, on the other hand, would categorize Chinese capitalism entirely on its formal institutions and structures, such as state control of major sectors and a lack of democracy. Instead, the hybrid approach examines how formal institutions interact with market forces and informal institutions, such as the function of state-owned companies in the economy and the impact of guanxi networks on business practices. This method provides for a more sophisticated view of Chinese capitalism's complexity and development.
