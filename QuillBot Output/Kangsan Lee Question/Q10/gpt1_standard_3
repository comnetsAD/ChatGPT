In contrast to a structural or institutional perspective, the author contends that Chinese capitalism is better understood as a "hybrid capitalism." As a result, the Chinese economic system combines aspects of both a market economy and a planned economy, with the government exerting major control over and direction over economic progress. With a hybrid strategy, the government may use market processes to accomplish its economic objectives while still keeping control over important industries and sectors. This provides for a balance between private business and governmental involvement. This strategy also gives the government more latitude in how it responds to opportunities and difficulties in the economy since it may change the intensity of its engagement and intervention as necessary. Overall, China's recent economic success may be attributed to the hybrid capitalism strategy, which enables a special blending of market forces with government regulation.
