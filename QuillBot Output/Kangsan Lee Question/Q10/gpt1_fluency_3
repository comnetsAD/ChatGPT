According to the author, Chinese capitalism is best defined as "hybrid capitalism," as opposed to a structural or institutional approach. This implies that the Chinese economic system has aspects of both a market and a planned economy, with the government having a key role in guiding and directing economic progress. The hybrid model provides for a mix of private industry and government involvement, with the government using market processes to accomplish economic objectives while still keeping control over critical industries and areas. This method also enables the government to react to economic difficulties and opportunities with more flexibility, since it may modify its degree of engagement and intervention as required. Overall, the hybrid capitalism method provides for a distinct combination of market forces and government direction, which has been critical to China's recent economic success.
