The author contends that Chinese capitalism is best characterized as "hybrid capitalism" since it incorporates features of both state-controlled and market-oriented systems. In contrast, a structural or institutional approach would describe Chinese capitalism entirely on the basis of its formal institutions and structures, such as state control of major sectors and the absence of democracy. The hybrid method examines how these formal institutions interact with market dynamics and informal institutions, such as the effect of guanxi networks on business practices and the role of state-owned businesses in the economy. This method permits a more nuanced understanding of the complexity and development of Chinese capitalism.
