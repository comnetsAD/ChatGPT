Individuals who have the ambition and potential to establish their own firm but have not yet taken considerable action to do so are nascent entrepreneurs. Similar to nascent entrepreneurs, nascent intrapreneurs have the potential and desire to launch a new enterprise inside an existing firm, but have not yet made substantial action in that direction. Latent entrepreneurs are those who have the capacity and desire to start their own firm, but have not yet discovered a viable opportunity or made considerable action in that direction. All three kinds of entrepreneurs have the potential to launch their own firm or endeavor, but are at varying levels of development.
