In the context of business, nascent entrepreneurs are those who are just getting their feet wet. They may have an idea for a company or a basic plan laid out, but they haven't taken any concrete action to make it a reality. On the other hand, nascent intrapreneurs are corporate personnel that have an entrepreneurial spirit and are always on the lookout for new ways to improve processes and develop new offerings. In business parlance, "latent entrepreneurs" are those who have the potential to launch a venture but have yet to do so. They may have the potential to be successful entrepreneurs because they have a concept for a company or because they possess the knowledge and expertise required to launch a successful venture.
