Individuals who have just begun honing their entrepreneurial talents and are in the process of launching a new firm or endeavor are nascent entrepreneurs. In contrast, nascent intrapreneurs are workers with entrepreneurial potential who are beginning to assume greater responsibility and initiative inside their firm. Latent entrepreneurs, on the other hand, are those who have the potential to become entrepreneurs but have not yet taken the essential steps to launch a firm. These people may have the necessary talents and finances, but they lack the confidence and opportunities to follow an entrepreneurial path.
