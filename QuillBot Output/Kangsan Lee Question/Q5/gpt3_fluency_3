Individuals who have just begun honing their entrepreneurial talents and are in the process of starting a new company or endeavor are referred to as nascent entrepreneurs. In contrast, nascent intrapreneurs are workers inside an organization that have entrepreneurial potential and are beginning to take on greater responsibility and initiative within the firm. Meanwhile, latent entrepreneurs are those who have the potential to be entrepreneurs but have not yet taken the essential steps to establish a firm. These people may have the necessary talents and resources, but they lack the confidence or chance to pursue entrepreneurship.
