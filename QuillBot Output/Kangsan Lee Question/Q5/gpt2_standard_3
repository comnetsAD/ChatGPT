People who have the potential and desire to launch their own firm but have not yet made any substantial moves in that direction are known as nascent entrepreneurs. Similar to emerging intrapreneurs, nascent intrapreneurs have the potential and desire to launch a new business inside an established corporation but have not yet made any major progress in that direction. Latent entrepreneurs are those who have the ability and desire to launch their own company but have not yet found a market or made any meaningful moves in that direction. Although they are at various phases of the process, all three categories of entrepreneurs have the ability to launch their own company or endeavor.
