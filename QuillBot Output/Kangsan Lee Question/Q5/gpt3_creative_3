Entrepreneurs in their nascent stages are those who have just recently begun honing their craft and are actively launching a new firm or endeavor. On the other side, nascent intrapreneurs are workers who have shown signs of entrepreneurial spirit and are beginning to take on more responsibilities and initiatives within the firm. To contrast, "latent entrepreneurs" are those who have the potential to become company owners but have not yet done so. Although they may be equipped to become successful business owners, these people often lack the motivation or connections necessary to actually do it.
