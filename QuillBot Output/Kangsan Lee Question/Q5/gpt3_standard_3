Nascent entrepreneurs are those who are currently in the process of starting a new firm or endeavor and have just begun to build their entrepreneurial talents. On the other side, nascent intrapreneurs are workers who have the potential to become entrepreneurs and are beginning to assume greater responsibility and initiative within the firm. Latent entrepreneurs, on the other hand, are those who have the ability to become business owners but have not yet taken the essential measures to launch a company. These people could be resourceful and skilled, but they lack the courage or opportunities to pursue business.
