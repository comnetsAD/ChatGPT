Individuals who are in the early phases of launching their own company are nascent entrepreneurs. They may have an idea or concept for a company, but have not yet taken official measures to create it. In contrast, nascent intrapreneurs are business personnel with an entrepreneurial attitude who seek chances to innovate and develop new goods or services inside the corporation. Latent entrepreneurs are those who have the potential to launch a company but have not yet taken the necessary measures to do so. They may have a concept for a company or the requisite skills and expertise, but have not yet taken the effort to implement their ideas.
