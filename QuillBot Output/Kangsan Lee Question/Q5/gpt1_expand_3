Individuals who are just getting their feet wet in the world of entrepreneurship are referred to as "nascent entrepreneurs." It's possible that they have a company idea or concept, but they haven't taken any official measures to begin the firm yet. On the other hand, nascent intrapreneurs are people working for a firm that have an entrepreneurial attitude and are seeking for possibilities to innovate and develop new goods or services inside the organization. This kind of person is known as an intrapreneur. People who have the ability to become self-employed but have not yet done so are considered "latent entrepreneurs." These people have the capacity to become entrepreneurs but have not yet done so. They may already have an idea for a company or the requisite skills and expertise, but they have not yet made the decision to put those thoughts into action.
