Individuals who have just begun the process of developing their entrepreneurial talents and who are in the process of launching a new company or endeavor are referred to as nascent entrepreneurs. On the other side, nascent intrapreneurs are personnel working for a firm who have the potential to be successful as entrepreneurs and who are beginning to assume a greater level of responsibility and initiative within the company. Individuals who have the potential to become entrepreneurs but have not yet taken the essential steps to establish a firm are referred to as "latent entrepreneurs." It's possible that these people have the necessary knowledge and resources, but they either lack the self-assurance or the opportunities to pursue entrepreneurship.
