In accordance with Ruef's theory, the likelihood of form formation may be broken down into two categories: the structural qualities of the network, and the cultural characteristics of the organization. The density of the network, the degree of centralization, and the existence of both strong and weak connections are all examples of structural features. The degree of trust, the willingness to take risks, and the amount of experimentation are all examples of cultural features. These two criteria, when considered together, influence the possibility that new forms will arise inside an organization as well as the degree to which those new forms will be embraced and implemented.
