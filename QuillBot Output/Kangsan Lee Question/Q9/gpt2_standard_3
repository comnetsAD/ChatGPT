According to Martin Ruef, structural predictors and cultural forecasters together determine the likelihood of form development. The quantity and quality of social links inside an organization, the degree of network connectivity, and the existence of structural holes are all examples of structural predictors. The degree of trust, universal standards and values, and the degree of communication and information flow inside the business are all cultural determinants. These two elements work together to affect the possibility of new forms developing inside an organization.
