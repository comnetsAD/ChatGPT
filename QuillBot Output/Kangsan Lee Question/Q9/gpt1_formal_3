According to Ruef, the chance of form development is determined by two factors: the network's structural qualities and the organization's cultural traits. Density of the network, degree of centralization, and the existence of strong and weak linkages are structural features. The cultural features consist of levels of trust, risk-taking, and experimentation. These two variables impact the possibility that new organizational forms will arise and the degree to which they will be embraced and implemented.
