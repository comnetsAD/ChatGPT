According to Martin Ruef, the chance of new form formation is determined by structural and cultural variables. The quantity and strength of social links inside an organization, as well as the degree of network connectivity and the existence of structural gaps, are structural determinants. Cultural predictors include the organization's degree of trust, shared norms and values, and communication and information flow. Together, these two elements affect the chance of new organizational structures arising.
