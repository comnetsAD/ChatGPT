Martin Ruef defines the likelihood of form emergence as two factors: the strength of links within a network and the network's variety. The amount of familiarity, trust, and closeness among persons inside a network is referred to as the strength of links. The existence of various sorts of persons, groups, and organizations inside the network is referred to as the network's diversity. Strong linkages inside a network, according to Ruef, may enhance collaboration and coordination while also limiting the flow of new ideas and information. Weak linkages and diversified connections, on the other hand, might enable the introduction of fresh ideas and viewpoints while simultaneously making coordination and collaboration more difficult. As a result, successful organizational innovation requires a mix of strong and weak relationships, as well as a diversified network.
