The likelihood of form emergence, according to Martin Ruef, is characterized by two factors: structural forecasters and cultural predictors. The quantity and strength of social links inside an organization, as well as the degree of network connectivity and the existence of structural gaps, are all structural determinants. The amount of trust, shared norms and values, and the level of communication and information flow inside the business are all cultural factors. These two criteria, when combined, determine the chance of new forms forming inside an organization.
