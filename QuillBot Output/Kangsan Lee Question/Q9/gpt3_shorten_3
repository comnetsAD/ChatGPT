Martin Ruef states that network diversity and tie strength determine form emergence likelihood. Network members' familiarity, trust, and closeness determine tie strength. Diverse people, groups, and organizations make up the network. Strong network linkages may promote collaboration and coordination, but they can also stifle innovation, according to Ruef. Weak linkages and diversified connections might provide fresh ideas and viewpoints but make coordination and collaboration harder. Thus, organizational innovation requires both strong and weak relationships and a diversified network.
