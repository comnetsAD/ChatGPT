According to Martin Ruef's research, the chance of form formation is determined by two factors: the strength of links within a network and the variety of the network itself. When we talk about the familiarity, trust, and closeness that exists between members of a network, we refer to this as the strength of the links. The term "diversity of the network" refers to the fact that the network is comprised of a wide variety of people, groups, and organizations of different kinds. According to Ruef, strong linkages within a network have the potential to promote collaboration and coordination, but they also have the potential to restrict the flow of new ideas and information. In contrast, having weak relationships and various connections may make it easier to share fresh ideas and points of view, but they may also make it more challenging to coordinate and work together. Therefore, in order for there to be successful organizational innovation, there has to be a balance between strong and weak relationships, in addition to a diversified network.
