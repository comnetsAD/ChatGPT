According to Martin Ruef, the chance of form emergence is determined by two variables: the strength of a network's links and the network's variety. The strength of links relates to the amount of familiarity, trust, and closeness between network members. The network's diversity refers to the existence of many sorts of persons, groups, and organizations. Ruef believes that strong linkages within a network may enhance collaboration and coordination, but can also restrict the circulation of new ideas and information. In contrast, weak linkages and diversified connections might promote the introduction of fresh ideas and viewpoints, but also impede coordination and collaboration. For successful organizational innovation, a balance of strong and weak relationships, as well as a diversified network, is important.
