The strength of links within a network and the variety of a network are what characterize the chance of form development, according to Martin Ruef. How well-known, trusted, and intimate you are with someone in a network is how strong your links are. Different kinds of people, communities, and institutions are present in the network, which contributes to its variety. As Ruef explains, close relationships between members of a network are good for fostering coordination and collaboration, but they also stifle the spread of novel ideas and information. Weak relationships and diversified connections, on the other hand, may make it easier to introduce fresh ideas and viewpoints, but may hinder the ability to work together effectively. Therefore, successful organizational innovation requires a mix of strong and weak relationships within a diversified network.
