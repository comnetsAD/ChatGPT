Structure and culture, says Martin Ruef, are the two main determinants of a form's likelihood of emerging. The amount and quality of an organization's social links, as well as the degree to which its networks are interconnected and the existence of structural gaps, are all examples of structural predictors. Trust, shared ideals, and the ease of spreading news and updates across the company are all cultural indicators. These two elements, taken together, affect the organization's propensity for new forms to emerge.
