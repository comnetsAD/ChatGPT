Martin Ruef suggests that the likelihood of form emergence may be broken down into two categories: structural predictors and cultural forecasters. The quantity and intensity of social links that exist inside an organization, as well as the degree to which networks are linked to one another and the existence of structural gaps, are all examples of structural predictors. The degree to which an organization's members trust one another, the degree to which they share norms and values, as well as the amount of communication and information flow inside the company, are all cultural determinants. The combination of these two criteria determines the possibility that an organization will see the emergence of new forms.
