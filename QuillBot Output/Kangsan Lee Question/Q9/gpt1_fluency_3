According to Ruef, the chance of form development is dictated by two factors: the network's structural qualities and the organization's cultural traits. The density of the network, the degree of centralization, and the existence of strong and weak connections are all structural aspects. The amount of trust, the level of risk-taking, and the level of experimentation are all cultural features. These two criteria, when considered together, influence the possibility that new forms will arise inside an organization, as well as the amount to which they will be embraced and implemented.
