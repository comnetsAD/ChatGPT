Amazon.ae and Noon.com do not permit scraping, although Instock.ae permits. Researching the terms of service and website policies of each of these websites led me to this conclusion. Amazon.ae and Noon.com both restrict scraping and the use of automated techniques to obtain data from their respective websites. In contrast, neither the terms of service nor the website rules of Instock.ae include any such limitations.
