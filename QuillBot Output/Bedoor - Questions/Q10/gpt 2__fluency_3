Based on my study, it looks that Amazon.ae and Noon.com enable some webpage scraping. However, according to their terms of service, Instock.ae does not seem to enable scraping. This conclusion was reached after reviewing the website's "terms of service" or "robots.txt" file, which is a file used by websites to connect with web crawlers and define which pages or areas of the website should not be accessed by automated scripts. Scraping is typically not suggested if a website expressly bans scraping in its terms of service or robots.txt file. In addition, I looked for material on the website's developer page and forums to learn more about the scraping policy.
