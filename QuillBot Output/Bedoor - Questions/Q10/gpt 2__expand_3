According to the findings of my investigation, it would seem that both Amazon.ae and Noon.com do, to some extent, permit the scraping of their websites. However, according to their terms and conditions, Instock.ae does not seem to permit scraping of their data. Checking the website's "terms of service" or "robots.txt" file, which is a file that websites use to communicate with web crawlers and specify which pages or sections of the website should not be accessed by automated scripts, led me to this conclusion. The file is referred to as "terms of service" or "robots.txt," respectively. It is typically not suggested to scrape a website that expressly forbids scraping in their terms of service or robots.txt file. If this is the case, the website should be avoided. In addition, in order to learn more about the scraping policy of the website, I looked for material on the website's developer page as well as its forums.
