Amazon.ae and Noon.com prohibit scraping, however Instock.ae does. I concluded this after reviewing each website's terms of service and policies. Amazon.ae and Noon.com explicitly forbid scraping and automated data collection. In contrast, Instock.ae has no such limits in their terms of service or website rules.
