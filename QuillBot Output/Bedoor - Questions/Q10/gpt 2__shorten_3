According to my investigation, Amazon.ae and Noon.com enable scraping. Instock.ae's terms and services prohibit scraping. The website's "terms of service" or "robots.txt" file, which communicates with web crawlers and specifies which pages or portions should not be accessed by automated scripts, led me to this conclusion. If a website's terms of service or robots.txt file forbids scraping, don't do it. I also checked the developer page and forums for scraping policy information.
