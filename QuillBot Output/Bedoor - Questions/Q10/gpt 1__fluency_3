Amazon.ae and Noon.com do not permit scraping, although Instock.ae permits. I arrived at this conclusion by examining each of these websites' terms of service and website policies. Both Amazon.ae and Noon.com explicitly ban scraping or the use of automated methods to acquire data from their websites. Instock.ae, on the other hand, has no such limits included in their terms of service or website rules.
