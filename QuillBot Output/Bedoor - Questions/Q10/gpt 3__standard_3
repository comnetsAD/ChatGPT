A friend has asked us to create a function that would gather product information from three websites and suggest which one to purchase based on the pricing and user reviews. However, we must determine whether of the websites listed below genuinely permit scraping: Give your responses and, in a few lines, explain how you arrived at them. My investigation suggests that the terms of service for all three websites—Amazon.ae, Noon.com, and Instock.ae—forbid website scraping without consent. You won't access the Site using a robot, spider, scraper, or other automatic methods without our prior written consent, according to Amazon.ae's terms of service page. The terms of service page for Noon.com also reads, "You must not use any device, program or routine to disrupt or try to interfere with the normal running of this Site or any activity being done on this Site." In addition, "You must not participate in any conduct that interferes with or disrupts the Services," according to Instock.ae's terms of use. So's vital to remember that downloading information without authorization from these websites is prohibited, and the websites have the right to sue anybody caught doing it.
