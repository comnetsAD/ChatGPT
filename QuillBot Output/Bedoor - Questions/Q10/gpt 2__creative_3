My investigations lead me to believe that Amazon.ae and Noon.com permit web scraping to some extent. Unfortunately, it seems that scraping is not permitted on Instock.ae due to their policies and restrictions. This conclusion was reached when I reviewed the site's "terms of service" or "robots.txt" file, which is used by websites to provide information to web crawlers about which parts of the site should be blocked to such programs. It is not suggested to scrape a website if doing so is expressly forbidden by the site's terms of service or robots.txt file. To learn more about the website's scraping policy, I also looked at the developer page and forums.
