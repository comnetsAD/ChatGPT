A colleague has requested that we develop a tool that compares prices and customer ratings across three online retailers and then advises them on which goods to purchase. However, we must determine whether of the following sites genuinely support scraping. Please include your replies and a brief explanation of your reasoning. From what I can see, scraping the websites of Amazon.ae, Noon.com, and Instock.ae is not allowed without express authorization, as stated in their respective terms of service. You will not use any robot, spider, scraper, or other automated methods to access the Site for any purpose without our prior written consent," states Amazon.ae on their terms of service website. You agree not to use any device, program, or routine to interfere or try to interfere with the normal operation of this Site or any activity being done on this Site, as stated on the Noon.com terms of service page. One more thing: "You must not participate in any action that interferes with or disrupts the Services," as stated on the Instock.ae terms of service website. Remember that these sites have the right to pursue legal action against anybody caught scraping their data without authorization.
