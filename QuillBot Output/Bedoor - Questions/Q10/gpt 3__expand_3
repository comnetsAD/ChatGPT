A friend has asked us to create a function that would scrape product data from three distinct websites, compare the prices of each option, and provide a recommendation on which product is the best value. Having said that, we need to determine whether of the websites listed below genuinely permit scraping: Please provide your answers and a brief explanation of how you arrived at each one in the next couple of sentences: According to the findings of my investigation, it would seem that all three companies, Amazon.ae, Noon.com, and Instock.ae, have terms of service that forbid users from scraping their websites without first obtaining permission. You are prohibited from using any robot, crawler, scraper, or other automatic methods to access the Site for any purpose without first obtaining our prior written consent, as stated on the terms of use page for Amazon.ae. A similar provision can be found on the page describing the terms of service for Noon.com, which reads, "You must not use any device, program, or routine to interfere or try to interfere with the normal running of this Site or any activity being done on this Site." Last but not least, the page detailing the conditions of use for Instock.ae specifies that users are forbidden from participating in any behavior that might disrupt or interfere with the services provided by the website. It is imperative that you be aware that scraping the data from these websites without permission is against the law, and the websites have the ability to take legal action against people who violate their terms of service.
