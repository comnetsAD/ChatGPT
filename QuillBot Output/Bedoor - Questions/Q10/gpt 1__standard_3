While Instock.ae does permit scraping, neither Amazon.ae nor Noon.com do. I've studied each of these websites' terms of service and website rules in order to reach this conclusion. Both Noon.com and Amazon.ae make it clear that using automated programs to scrape data from their websites is not allowed. However, Instock.ae's terms of service and website rules make no mention of any such limitations.
