In contrast to Amazon.ae and Noon.com, Instock.ae permits scraping. This conclusion was reached after I read each site's rules and terms of service. Amazon.ae and Noon.com both have policies that explicitly forbid data scraping and the use of automated methods to acquire information from their sites. In contrast, neither the terms of service nor the site rules of Instock.ae contain any such limits.
