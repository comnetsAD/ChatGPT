According to my investigation, Amazon.ae and Noon.com seem to permit webpage scraping to some extent. According to their terms of service, Instock.ae does not seem to enable scraping. Checking the website's "terms of service" or "robots.txt" file, which websites employ to interact with web crawlers and define which pages or areas of the website should not be accessed by automated scripts, led me to this conclusion. If a website's terms of service or robots.txt file restricts scraping, it is typically not suggested to scrape the site. In order to learn more about the website's scraping policy, I also checked the developer page and forums.
