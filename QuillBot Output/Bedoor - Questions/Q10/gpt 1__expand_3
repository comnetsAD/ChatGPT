Scraping is not permitted on Amazon.ae, Noon.com, however it is permitted on Instock.ae. After doing some investigation into the terms of service and website policies of each of these websites, I have arrived to this conclusion. Both Amazon.ae and Noon.com have included statements on their privacy policies that make it clear that scraping or the use of automated technologies to obtain data from their respective websites is not permitted. On the other hand, neither the terms of service nor the website policies of Instock.ae include any reference of such limitations.
