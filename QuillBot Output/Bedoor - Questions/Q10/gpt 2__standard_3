My investigation suggests that Noon.com and Amazon.ae do enable some degree of page scraping. However, according to their terms and conditions, Instock.ae does not seem to permit scraping. The "terms of service" or "robots.txt" file, which websites employ to interact with web crawlers and define which pages or areas of the website should not be accessed by automated scripts, helped me arrive at this conclusion. In general, it is not advised to scrape a website that expressly forbids it in its robots.txt file or terms of service. In order to learn more about the website's scraping policy, I also looked for material on the developer page and forums.
