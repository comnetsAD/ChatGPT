A friend has asked us to develop a function that scrapes product data from three different websites and recommends which one to purchase based on pricing and reviews. However, we must determine whether of the following websites enable scraping: Provide your responses and, in a few lines, explain how you arrived at your conclusion. According to my study, all three companies, Amazon.ae, Noon.com, and Instock.ae, seem to have terms of service that prohibit scraping their websites without permission. On Amazon.ae's terms of use page, they mention that "You will not use any robot, spider, scraper, or other automated methods to access the Site for any purpose without our prior written consent.". Similarly, Noon.com's terms of usage website specifies that "You must not use any equipment, program or routine to interfere or try to interfere with the normal running of this Site or any activity being done on this Site.". Finally, the terms of service website of Instock.ae specifies that "You must not participate in any action that interferes with or disrupts the Services." It is crucial to highlight that scraping data from these websites without authorization is unlawful, and individuals who do so may face legal consequences.
