A buddy has requested that we create a function that would harvest product information from three distinct websites and propose the best one to purchase based on pricing and user reviews. However, we must determine whether of the following websites genuinely permit scraping: Provide your responses and, in a few lines, explain how you arrived at your conclusion. According to my investigation, the terms of service for all three companies, Amazon.ae, Noon.com, and Instock.ae, ban scraping their websites without permission. On Amazon.ae's terms of service page, it states, "You may not access the Site using any robot, spider, scraper, or other automated methods without our prior written consent." Similarly, Noon.com's terms of service website reads, "You must not use any device, program, or routine to disrupt or try to interfere with the normal functioning of this Site or any activity undertaken on this Site." The terms of service website for Instock.ae concludes, "You must not participate in any action that interferes with or disrupts the Services." Noting that scraping the data from these websites without permission is unlawful and that the websites may take legal action against anyone who do so is vital.
