The ownership of essentials, such as energy generation, transportation, and housing, by the public would be an effective method of combating climate change. The rationale for this is that public ownership would empower governments to make choices based on the public benefit as opposed to profit. This would allow governments to invest in renewable and sustainable energy sources and construct infrastructure that is more energy-efficient and sustainable. In addition, it would empower governments to limit carbon emissions and safeguard vulnerable people from the effects of climate change. In addition, public ownership would allow governments to prevent the expense of lowering carbon emissions from being transferred to low-income families. With public ownership, governments might establish policies to keep energy prices low for all residents, which would be a crucial step in mitigating the effects of climate change on low-income families. Private ownership of essentials, on the other hand, is motivated by profit, which may result in short-term thinking and opposition to change. It may not be immediately lucrative for private enterprises to invest in sustainable infrastructure or renewable energy, thus they may be hesitant to do so. On the other side, public ownership would enable governments to make long-term investments in the public interest. In conclusion, public ownership of essentials would be a viable climate change mitigation strategy. It would allow governments to make choices based on the public good, invest in renewable energy sources, cut carbon emissions, and protect vulnerable people from the effects of climate change. It would also allow governments to prevent the expense of decreasing carbon emissions from being passed on to people with low incomes.
