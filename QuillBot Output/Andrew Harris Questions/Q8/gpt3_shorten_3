Public ownership of energy, transportation, and housing would reduce climate change. Public ownership allows governments to prioritize public welfare above profit. This would allow governments to invest in renewable energy and energy-efficient infrastructure. It would also empower governments to minimize carbon emissions and safeguard climate-vulnerable people. Public ownership would also allow governments to protect low-income families from carbon emission reduction costs. Public ownership would allow governments to lower energy prices for everyone, which would help low-income people cope with climate change. Profit-driven private ownership of essentials may lead to short-term thinking and reluctance to change. Sustainable infrastructure and renewable energy may not be lucrative for private firms. Public ownership would allow governments to undertake long-term public-interest investments. Finally, public ownership of essentials would reduce climate change. It would empower governments to make public-good choices, invest in sustainable energy sources, cut carbon emissions, and protect vulnerable people from climate change. It would also allow governments to prevent low-income people from paying for carbon emission reductions.
