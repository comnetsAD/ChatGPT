If essentials like the energy and transportation infrastructure were owned by the public, it would be possible to manage these systems in a way that is both more effective and more environmentally friendly. This would contribute to the fight against climate change. When a company is privately owned, the main objective is often to increase profits, which may lead to inefficiencies as well as a lack of investment in environmentally conscious technology. On the other hand, when the utility is owned by the public, the main objective is to fulfill the needs of the community. This objective would match with the objectives of lowering emissions of greenhouse gases and shifting toward the usage of renewable energy sources. In addition, public ownership would make it possible to provide more equal access to essential resources. It is now difficult for many low-income communities and disadvantaged groups to purchase basic essentials like electricity and transportation, which may be a contributing factor in the perpetuation of poverty and inequality. It is possible that if these essentials were in public control, they would be priced affordably and readily available to all members of the society, irrespective of their individual levels of income. In addition, having these systems under public ownership would provide for a greater degree of democratic control over them. When a company is privately owned, decisions about how it is run are typically made by a select group of shareholders or executives. On the other hand, when a company is owned by the public, those decisions would be made through democratic processes, which would ensure that the wants and needs of the community are taken into consideration. In conclusion, public ownership of necessities would help mitigate climate change by allowing for more efficient and sustainable management of these systems, more equitable access to necessities, and democratic control over these systems. In addition, public ownership of necessities would help reduce inequality in access to necessities. It would be an important step towards a more equitable and environmentally sound future.
