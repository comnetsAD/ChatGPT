The public ownership of essentials such as electricity and transportation infrastructure would aid in climate change mitigation by enabling more efficient and sustainable management of these systems. Under private ownership, the main objective is often to increase profits, which may result in inefficiency and a dearth of investment in sustainable technology. In contrast, under public ownership, the main objective is to fulfill the needs of the community, which is consistent with lowering greenhouse gas emissions and shifting to renewable energy sources. Additionally, public ownership would facilitate more fair access to essentials. Numerous low-income neighborhoods and disadvantaged groups are now unable to afford electricity and transportation, which may perpetuate poverty and inequality. The public ownership of these basics might guarantee that they are inexpensive and available to all community members, regardless of their financial level. Moreover, public ownership would provide greater democratic oversight over these systems. With private ownership, decisions are often decided by a small number of shareholders or executives, but with public ownership, choices would be made via democratic procedures, taking into consideration the needs and concerns of the community. In conclusion, public ownership of essentials would help reduce climate change by enabling more effective and sustainable management of these systems, more equal access to essentials, and democratic control of these systems. It would contribute to a more equitable and sustainable future.
