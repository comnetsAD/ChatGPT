Public ownership of energy and transportation infrastructure would reduce climate change through improving management. Private ownership frequently prioritizes profits above efficiency and sustainable technology, which may lead to inefficiencies and underinvestment. Public ownership prioritizes community needs, which aligns with greenhouse gas reduction and renewable energy transition. Public ownership would also improve access to essentials. Energy and transportation costs may keep low-income and vulnerable populations in poverty. Public ownership may make essential basics cheap for all community members, regardless of income. Public ownership would provide these systems greater democratic control. With private ownership, a small group of shareholders or executives makes choices, while with public ownership, democratic procedures take into consideration community demands and concerns. In conclusion, public ownership of needs would reduce climate change by improving management, access, and democratic control. It would advance justice and sustainability.
