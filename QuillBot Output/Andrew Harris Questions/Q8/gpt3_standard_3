Climate change may be effectively reduced if essential services like housing, transportation, and energy generation were publicly owned. Because of public ownership, governments would be able to make choices that serve the common good rather than their personal financial interests. Governments would be able to invest in renewable and sustainable energy sources as well as more environmentally friendly infrastructure thanks to this. In addition, it would provide countries the ability to take action to cut carbon emissions and safeguard vulnerable areas from the effects of climate change. Additionally, public ownership would provide governments the ability to prevent low-income people from bearing the burden of the expense of decreasing carbon emissions. Governments might enact measures to keep energy prices low for all residents through public ownership, which would be a significant step in minimizing the effects of climate change on low-income families. Contrarily, the profit-driven nature of private ownership of essentials may result in short-term thinking and reluctance to change. Because it may not be immediately lucrative, private enterprises could be hesitant to invest in sustainable infrastructure or renewable energy. On the other hand, public ownership would enable governments to undertake long-term investments that serve the general welfare. Finally, public ownership of essentials would be a successful strategy for reducing climate change. It would empower governments to take action to cut carbon emissions, invest in renewable energy sources, and safeguard vulnerably situated populations from the effects of climate change. Additionally, it would allow governments to prevent low-income families from bearing the expense of lowering carbon emissions.
