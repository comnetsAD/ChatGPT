Public ownership of essentials like energy generation, transportation, and housing would be an effective strategy to combat climate change. The rationale for this is that government would be able to make choices based on the public benefit rather than profit. This would allow governments to invest in sustainable and renewable energy sources, as well as build more energy-efficient and environmentally friendly infrastructure. Furthermore, it would allow governments to take action to cut carbon emissions and protect vulnerable people from the effects of climate change. Furthermore, public ownership would allow governments to guarantee that the expense of decreasing carbon emissions does not fall disproportionately on low-income families. Governments might utilize public ownership to enact policies that keep energy prices low for all residents, which would be a significant step toward lowering the effect of climate change on low-income families. Private ownership of essentials, on the other hand, is motivated by profit, which may lead to short-term thinking and opposition to change. Private enterprises may be hesitant to engage in renewable energy or sustainable infrastructure since it may not be lucrative right away. In contrast, public ownership would enable governments to make long-term investments in the public interest. Finally, public ownership of essentials would be an effective method of mitigating climate change. It would allow governments to make choices based on the public good, invest in sustainable energy sources, cut carbon emissions, and protect vulnerable people from the effects of climate change. It would also allow governments to guarantee that the expense of lowering carbon emissions does not fall disproportionately on low-income families.
