Climate change demands rapid action. Technological advancement alone will not mitigate. Technology may help combat climate change, but it is not a cure. First, human activity—specifically using fossil fuels—is the main driver of climate change. New technology may lower emissions but not eliminate them. New technology cannot undo past harm. Technology alone overlooks the reality that climate change is a global issue that needs concerted action from governments, corporations, and people. Technology cannot prevent climate change without structural adjustments. Finally, evaluate the drawbacks and unforeseen effects of overusing technology. New technology may be costly, difficult to deploy, and harmful to the environment and society in developing nations. In conclusion, climate change worries are justified and need quick and comprehensive response. Technology may help mitigate climate change, but structural adjustments and collaborative action are required.
