Undoubtedly, ensuring action to reduce climate change is essential, but disregarding ethical considerations in the creation of climate policy might result in unintended effects and eventually undermine the purpose of mitigating climate change. The implementation of climate policy should take into consideration its ethical implications, especially for disadvantaged and vulnerable people. Ignoring ethical considerations in climate policy may result in policies that disproportionately impact disadvantaged and vulnerable people, including low-income families, Indigenous communities, and communities of color. Implementing a carbon tax without enough assistance for low-income families, for instance, might result in increasing energy bills and severe economic suffering. Similarly, enacting policies that favor large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) without taking Indigenous people' affects into account may result in the infringement of their rights. In addition, addressing ethical issues in climate policy may aid in gaining the support of disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, which is essential for the success of climate action. Involving these populations in the policymaking process may result in more fair and effective solutions. Although guaranteeing action to prevent climate change is essential, it should not come at the price of ethical issues. Climate policy should consider the ethical implications of its execution and prioritize the protection of vulnerable and disadvantaged groups. This will not only result in more fair solutions, but it will also increase support for climate action among the most afflicted individuals.
