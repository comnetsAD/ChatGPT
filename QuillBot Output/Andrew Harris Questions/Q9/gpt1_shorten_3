Taking action to reduce climate change is crucial, but disregarding ethical issues in climate policy might backfire and harm the cause. Climate policy should consider its ethical effects on underprivileged and vulnerable groups. Climate policies that ignore ethics may impact low-income families, Indigenous communities, and communities of color. Implementing a carbon price without supporting low-income families might raise energy costs and economic suffering. Implementing policies that favor large-scale carbon capture and storage (CCS) without consulting Indigenous populations may violate human rights. Addressing ethical issues in climate policy may assist disadvantaged and vulnerable people embrace climate action, which is vital. Involving these populations in policymaking may improve outcomes. Finally, climate change mitigation should not compromise ethics. Climate policy should safeguard underprivileged and vulnerable groups and consider ethical issues. This will improve equity and increase climate action support among the most affected.
