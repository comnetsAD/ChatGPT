Climate policy should emphasize ethics above climate change mitigation. Ethics and social justice should govern the complete and coordinated response to climate change. First, climate change disproportionately affects underprivileged and vulnerable groups, who suffer the most. Thus, inclusive and equitable climate policy must respect these populations' rights and demands. Second, climate change demands international cooperation. Thus, ethical issues like the concept of shared but differentiated obligations, which acknowledges the varying capabilities and responsibilities of various nations and areas, are crucial to climate policy. Thirdly, mitigating climate change is vital, but so are its possible social and economic effects. Thus, climate policy must take ethical issues like the precautionary principle into account. In conclusion, climate policy should emphasize ethical issues above climate change mitigation. To make climate policies successful and fair, ethical factors including inclusion, equality, collaboration, and the precautionary principle should be taken into account.
