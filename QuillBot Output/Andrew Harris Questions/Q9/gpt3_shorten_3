Climate policy should prioritize climate change mitigation since inaction has global effects. Climate policy should also address ethics. Climate change mitigation should be distributed fairly among nations and people. Developed nations emit the most greenhouse gases, yet underdeveloped nations are typically the most impacted by climate change. Thus, climate policy must include the idea of shared but differentiated duties, which recognizes that industrialized nations have a higher obligation to mitigate climate change since they contributed more to the issue. Climate policies may harm disadvantaged populations. Climate policy may affect people's life, especially those in poverty or marginalized. Thus, climate policy must safeguard disadvantaged groups. Climate change mitigation technology have ethical considerations. Large-scale bioenergy with carbon capture and storage (BECCS) deployment raises ethical questions concerning land usage and food security. In conclusion, climate policy should prioritize climate change mitigation, but not exclusively. Equity, disadvantaged groups, and the ethics of climate change mitigation technologies must be considered. Ignoring ethical issues may have unforeseen repercussions and hinder climate policy.
