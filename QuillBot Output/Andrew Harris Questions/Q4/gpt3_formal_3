This may impede the implementation of policies and activities with long-term advantages, such as investing in renewable energy or instituting carbon pricing.

For instance, democratic methods enable residents to express their concerns and goals, which may assist guarantee that climate policies are responsive to their requirements. In addition, democratic procedures may offer a venue for developing a wide coalition of support for climate action, which can assist in overcoming opposition from interest groups and political actors that may oppose climate action.

Moreover, democratic methods may allow the engagement of many stakeholders in the decision-making process, so contributing to the development of a shared feeling of ownership and responsibility for climate action. In conclusion, democratic procedures at the national level create obstacles for long-term climate change planning, but they also offer significant potential for engaging individuals and creating support for climate action.
