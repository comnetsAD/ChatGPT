National democratic procedures may support long-term climate change planning. Climate change demands long-term planning and action, but democratic procedures may help. First, democratic systems let voters hold elected authorities responsible for climate change. Citizens may advocate for climate change policy and hold elected leaders responsible via elections and civic participation. Second, democratic methods enable citizen climate change decision-making. Citizens may have their opinions heard on climate policy and activities via public consultations, citizen juries, and other kinds of public participation. Thirdly, democracy makes climate change choices open and accountable. Citizens may learn about climate policy and hold decision-makers accountable via open government and access to information legislation. However, democratic methods alone may not solve climate change. Governments, corporations, and civil society must work together to address climate change. Thus, to combat climate change, a broad variety of people must be involved and their activities must be democratic. Long-term climate change planning is consistent with national democratic systems. Democratic procedures allow voters to hold elected officials responsible, participate in decision-making, and assure transparency. However, democratic methods alone may not be enough to adequately address climate change, thus it is vital to include many players.
