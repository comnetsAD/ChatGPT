The notion that national-level democratic procedures are incompatible with long-term climate change planning is erroneous. Climate change is a long-term issue that requires long-term solutions, and democratic procedures are critical to achieving such answers. Democratic procedures allow individuals to voice their opinions and participate in decision-making. They also allow voters to hold their elected officials responsible for their conduct. This is critical in the context of climate change because it enables residents to voice their worries about the effects of climate change on their communities and hold their politicians responsible for acting to address those issues. Furthermore, democratic methods may allow individuals to engage in the formulation of long-term climate change policy. Policies that minimize greenhouse gas emissions, increase energy efficiency, and safeguard vulnerable populations are examples of this. Democracy may assist to guarantee that policies are fair, effective, and universally accepted by enabling individuals to participate in their formation. Furthermore, national-level democratic procedures enable nations to collaborate and coordinate their efforts to combat climate change. International treaties, such as the Paris Agreement, are produced via democratic procedures and demand the involvement of several nations, allowing governments to collaborate to solve a global issue. Finally, national-level democratic procedures are not incompatible with long-term climate change planning. They are, in fact, critical in tackling this problem. Citizens may voice their opinions, keep their politicians responsible, and participate in the creation of long-term policy and international collaboration via democratic procedures. Without democratic engagement, it would be impossible to design fair, effective, and broadly acceptable solutions to combat climate change, which is a global issue requiring worldwide collaboration.
