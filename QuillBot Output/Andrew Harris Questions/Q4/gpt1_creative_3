Long-term planning in response to climate change and the need to maintain national democratic systems are not mutually exclusive. Given the magnitude of the climate change crisis, it is imperative that we use democratic mechanisms in our search for long-term solutions. Citizen voices are heard and considered in democratic decision-making. Moreover, they allow voters to hold officials to account for decisions made on their behalf. In the context of climate change, this is crucial because it enables regular people to voice their worries about the effects of climate change on their neighborhoods and to demand that their elected officials do something to mitigate these effects. Further, democratic systems may allow for public input into the creation of long-term strategies to combat climate change. Climate change mitigation measures, energy efficiency initiatives, and safeguards for at-risk populations are all examples of what this term might include. Democratic procedures serve to guarantee that these policies are fair, effective, and generally accepted by enabling individuals to take part in the process of formulating them. More than that, democratic mechanisms at the national level allow nations to work together and coordinate their responses to climate change. International accords like the Paris Agreement allow nations to work together to solve a global issue since they are formed via democratic procedures and demand the involvement of diverse countries. In conclusion, long-term planning for climate change is not incompatible with democratic procedures at the national level. They are, in fact, essential to solving the problem at hand. Citizens can have their voices heard, legislators can be held to account, and they can collaborate on policies that will last for years and even across borders via democratic procedures. Developing equitable, effective, and generally supported solutions to combat climate change, a global challenge requiring the collaboration of all countries, would be challenging without democratic engagement.
