Local ownership is crucial to climate change. Climate change affects localities worldwide. Thus, local communities and organizations must actively confront the problem. Local communities and organizations better understand and solve their issues and possibilities when they take responsibility of climate change. They also have greater information, skills, and resources to create and execute successful solutions. Local communities and organizations may better examine their community's cultural, economic, and social context, making solutions more sustainable. Local ownership improves climate change solutions' efficacy and equality. By incorporating local communities and organizations in solution creation and execution, solutions are customized to the community's needs and goals rather than imposed from the outside. Developing solutions with those most impacted by the problem also makes them more egalitarian. In conclusion, local ownership guarantees that solutions are suited to the community's needs and goals, sustainable, and egalitarian. Involve local communities and groups in climate change decision-making and empower them to act.
