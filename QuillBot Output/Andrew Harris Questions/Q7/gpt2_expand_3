For a variety of reasons, combating climate change requires a focus on issues that are locally owned and controlled. To begin, local ownership enables more efficient decision-making and the execution of climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies. When choices are decided at the local level, rather than being imposed from higher up, they are more likely to be suited to the particular requirements and resources of the community. This is in contrast to when decisions are made at a higher level. This makes it more likely that the measures will be accepted by the community and kept up over time, as well as making them more successful in tackling the unique difficulties that are being faced by the community. Second, community participation and empowerment may be increased via the use of locally owned businesses. When local communities take ownership of measures to combat climate change, there is a greater likelihood that those communities will become involved in the result and engaged in the process. This may result in a higher feeling of ownership and pride in the community's efforts to combat climate change, as well as increased community buy-in and support for the initiatives. Thirdly, having ownership at the local level may result in a more fair allocation of both benefits and expenses. When local communities are involved in the decision-making process, they have a better chance of ensuring that the benefits of climate change initiatives are shared fairly among all members of the community, rather than being concentrated in the hands of a select few. This is because local communities are more likely to take into account the needs and concerns of their own members when making decisions. In conclusion, tackling climate change requires local ownership since it enables more effective decision-making, more community participation and empowerment, and fair distribution of benefits and costs. We can guarantee that climate change adaptation and mitigation measures are customized to the individual requirements of each community if we give local people a voice in the process. This also increases the likelihood that these measures will be accepted and maintained in the long term.
