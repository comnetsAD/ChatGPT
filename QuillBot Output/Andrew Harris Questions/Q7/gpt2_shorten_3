Climate change requires local responsibility for many reasons. First, local ownership improves decision-making and climate change mitigation and adaptation. Local choices are more likely to reflect community needs and resources than top-down ones. This makes the actions more effective at addressing community issues and more likely to be accepted and maintained. Local ownership empowers and engages communities. Local communities are more involved and invested in climate change programs when they own them. This may increase community support and pride in climate change activities. Thirdly, local ownership may improve cost-benefit distribution. Local communities are more likely to distribute climate change benefits equitably when they are engaged in decision-making. In conclusion, local ownership improves decision-making, community empowerment, and benefit-cost distribution to combat climate change. Giving local communities a voice in the process ensures that climate change mitigation and adaptation strategies are customized to their requirements and more likely to be accepted and maintained.
