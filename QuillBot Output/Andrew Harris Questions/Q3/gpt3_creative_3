Taking on climate change is a daunting challenge that calls for a concerted, all-encompassing effort. Implementing relevant legal and regulatory frameworks is an integral part of this strategy. Because they establish norms, incentivize positive behavior, and provide a path forward, laws and regulations are crucial to combating climate change. They may aid in the fight against global warming by boosting energy efficiency and safeguarding at-risk populations. Enforcement by the state is essential in this respect. Governments have the authority to uphold the law, establish systems to ensure citizens abide by the rules, and punish those who break the rules. They have the means to investigate the issue, keep an eye on compliance, and spread the word about the significance of taking action to mitigate climate change. When governments fail to do so, however, private or other decentralized actors may step in to ensure proper climate action is taken. Private actors may help combat climate change by cutting their own carbon emissions and pushing for more proactive government policies and regulations. Non-governmental organizations and other forms of civil society may also contribute significantly to raising public knowledge and enlightenment about the need of taking action on climate change. In addition, non-government organizations and businesses have an opportunity to contribute to climate change mitigation by developing and deploying new approaches to lowering GHG emissions. They may also cut emissions and advance sustainable development by financing renewable energy, energy efficiency, and carbon offset projects. In conclusion, proper rules and regulations must be enforced if we are to successfully combat climate change. In this respect, the state plays a critical role by establishing norms, designing incentives, and laying out a strategy for moving forward. Nonetheless, private or other decentralized players may play a role in ensuring right climate action by implementing legislation, proposing creative solutions, and investing in sustainable development initiatives, especially in the absence of official enforcement.
