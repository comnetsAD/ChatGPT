Since it is essential to comprehend the existing status of the environment, detect future problems, and monitor progress toward lowering greenhouse gas emissions and overall environmental effect, measurement is in fact one of the main difficulties to mitigating climate change. For the purpose of determining the contribution of human activities to climate change and limiting it, accurate measurement of greenhouse gas emissions is crucial. It is crucial to remember that measuring the effects of climate change is not the only difficulty. Inadequate laws and regulations, a lack of public knowledge and participation, and a lack of political will are a few more issues that need to be addressed. Even precise measurements will not result in significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the absence of robust policies and regulations. Additionally, in order to achieve the required carbon reductions, public support and involvement are crucial. Furthermore, reducing the consequences of climate change won't be possible with only measurement. A multidimensional strategy is needed to address the complicated and widespread problem of climate change, which calls for both lowering emissions and adjusting to its already-occurring impacts. In particular, this entails tackling issues like sea level rise, an increase in the frequency and intensity of severe weather events, and growing food and water poverty. In conclusion, while measuring climate change is important, it is not the sole problem. To successfully reduce the effects of climate change, a complete strategy that combines monitoring, rules, public involvement, and adaptation is required.
