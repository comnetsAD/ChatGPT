Measurement is essential to understanding the environment, identifying problems, and tracking progress toward lowering greenhouse gas emissions and environmental impact. Assessing and minimizing human contribution to climate change requires accurate greenhouse gas emission assessment. Climate change mitigation involves more than measurement. Other issues include political will, weak rules and laws, and public knowledge and involvement. Even reliable measurements cannot reduce greenhouse gas emissions without robust policies and laws. Emission reductions need public support and involvement. Measurement alone cannot alleviate climate change. Climate change is a complicated global problem that involves both cutting emissions and responding to its impacts. Sea-level rise, increased severe weather events, and water and food poverty must be addressed. Conclusion, measuring climate change is important but not the sole difficulty. Climate change mitigation requires monitoring, policies, public participation, and adaptation.
