Understanding the present status of the environment, spotting possible problems, and keeping track of progress toward lowering greenhouse gas emissions and overall environmental impact all need accurate measurements, making measurement one of the key difficulties of climate change mitigation. If we are going to determine how much human activities are contributing to climate change and then take steps to mitigate that contribution, we need to have accurate measurements of greenhouse gas emissions. The difficulty of accurate measurement is only one of several obstacles to reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Lack of political will, poor rules and regulations, and insufficient public knowledge and involvement are just a few of the additional obstacles that must be overcome. Even with precise measurements, it will be impossible to effectively reduce emissions of greenhouse gases without strict laws and regulations. As a corollary, public participation and backing are crucial to attaining the required reductions in emissions. In addition, relying just on measurements will not be enough to lessen the impact of climate change. Because of the complexity and global scope of climate change, tackling the problem needs a multidimensional strategy that prioritizes both cutting emissions and adapting to the impacts of the phenomenon. The issues of rising sea levels, more frequent and intense severe weather, and rising water and food poverty all need to be addressed. The ability to accurately evaluate climate change impacts is essential, but it is far from the sole difficulty in combating this global phenomenon. Mitigating the effects of climate change requires a multifaceted strategy that include not just monitoring but also policies, public involvement, and adaptation.
