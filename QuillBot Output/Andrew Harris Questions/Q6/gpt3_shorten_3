Measuring climate change is not the biggest difficulty. Measuring climate change is crucial, but it's not the only problem. Climate change is complicated and needs a coordinated effort. First, measuring the problem's breadth and success in lowering emissions and encouraging sustainable development is crucial. However, mitigation and adaptation are needed to solve the problem. Reduce greenhouse gas emissions, invest in renewable energy, restore ecosystems, and create community resilience. Second, measuring and lowering emissions is just one part of climate change. Climate change demands resolving socio-economic, political, and equitable challenges. Climate change disproportionately impacts disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, thus solutions must be inclusive, egalitarian, and respect their rights and needs. Thirdly, dependable data and accurate emission measuring techniques might be difficult to get. Aviation, shipping, agricultural, and land use emissions are difficult to monitor. In conclusion, measuring climate change is vital but not the main issue.
