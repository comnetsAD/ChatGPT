Civil disobedience may attract attention to concerns and promote change, but it is not necessarily the sole gauge for success. Civil disobedience disrupts the current quo and draws attention to government-ignored concerns. Civil disobedience often changes policy, but it's not the sole effect. Civil disobedience raises awareness and educates the people, not only to influence legislation. Dialog and discussion may lead to more durable solutions than legislative change alone. It may also transform society's structure and systems, not only policy. Civil disobedience does not fail if it does not affect policy. Civil disobedience may accelerate policy change. It may also affect public perception or start new social movements. In conclusion, civil disobedience may raise awareness and inspire change, but it is not necessarily the sole measure of success. Civil disobedience success should be measured beyond policy change. Awareness, conversation, and structural change are also effective results.
