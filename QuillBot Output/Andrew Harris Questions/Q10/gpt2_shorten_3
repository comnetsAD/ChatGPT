Civil disobedience may draw attention to social and political concerns and encourage governments to act. However, civil disobedience's success or failure should not be primarily based on policy change. First, policy change is complicated and delayed, thus civil disobedience may not have immediate impacts. Civil disobedience may raise awareness and momentum for policy change even if it is not apparent. Civil disobedience may also raise awareness of neglected problems, affect public opinion, and encourage legislative change. Civil disobedience aims to affect policy and public opinion. It may suggest individuals are prepared to sacrifice their lives for a cause. It may also question the current quo and empower individuals to act. In conclusion, civil disobedience should aim for policy change but not just for it. Civil disobedience may also raise awareness, change public opinion, and inspire action. Civil disobedience should be judged on its influence on public knowledge, public opinion, and community empowerment.
