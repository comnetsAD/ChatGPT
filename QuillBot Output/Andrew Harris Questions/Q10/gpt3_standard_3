Although civil disobedience may be a useful strategy for drawing attention to problems and igniting change, I contend that this is not necessarily the best method to judge its effectiveness. Disrupting the status quo and drawing attention to problems that are not being addressed by the government or other authorities are the goals of civil disobedience, a kind of protest. Civil disobedience often results in changes in policy, but this is not the only result that has to be taken into account. It is crucial to remember that civil disobedience sometimes works to educate and increase public awareness about a problem rather than forcing an instant change in legislation. Additionally, it can open up channels for discussion and negotiation, which might result in longer-lasting solutions than if policy change were the only possible consequence. Additionally, rather than merely a shift in policy, it may result in more significant structural and systemic changes in society. Furthermore, just because civil disobedience does not result in a change in policy does not imply that it is a failure. Civil disobedience may act as a catalyst for policy change, which may take time and consistent effort. It may also result in other kinds of transformation, such a change in public opinion or the emergence of new social movements. As a result, although civil disobedience may be a useful strategy for drawing attention to problems and igniting change, it is not usually the sole yardstick for judging its effectiveness. The only result that should be taken into account when determining if civil disobedience was successful is a change in policy. Successful outcomes may also include other types of change including systemic reform, discourse, and increasing awareness.
