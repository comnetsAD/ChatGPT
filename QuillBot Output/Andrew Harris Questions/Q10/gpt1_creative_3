It would be wrong to suggest that the goal of civil disobedience should be a change in policy and that anything less would be a failure. One method of bringing about the desired change is via civil disobedience, which is a type of protest and non-violent opposition. To bring about policy change, civil disobedience is not always the most successful strategy, although it may be useful in bringing about awareness and attention to a problem. For instance, it may be an effective means of drawing attention to problems that the government is ignoring, but it may not be the ideal method for solving more complicated problems that need more than one strategy. The process of changing policies may be lengthy, so even if a civil disobedience movement is successful, it may take some time before the desired results are seen. Furthermore, civil disobedience may be an effective means of bringing about change; but, it is not the sole means, and should be used in tandem with other types of activism, such as lobbying, advocacy, and grassroots organization. Although civil disobedience and other forms of nonviolent resistance are crucial in bringing about policy change, this does not mean that they are the only options. Although it is an useful means of bringing about legislative change, it is not necessarily the most efficient technique for raising awareness and bringing attention to a problem. It is important to utilize civil disobedience in tandem with other types of activism, such as lobbying, advocacy, and grassroots organization, since changing policies may be a lengthy process, even after a successful campaign.
