I would argue that although the number of arrests made as a result of civil disobedience is one indicator of success, it is by no means the sole one. To disturb the current quo and call attention to concerns that are not being addressed by the government or other authorities is the goal of civil disobedience. Although policy change is a possible result of civil disobedience, it is not the only one. It's crucial to remember that the goal of civil disobedience isn't usually to force a swift shift in legislation, but rather to bring attention to and education about a particular subject. It opens the door for discussion and compromise, which may result in longer-lasting solutions than a mere shift in policy would allow for. In addition to influencing policy shifts, it has the potential to effect broader societal transformations. Further, the fact that civil disobedience does not result in a shift in policy does not make it fruitless. Civil disobedience may be a catalyst for policy change, which may take time and consistent effort. Additionally, it may result in other types of transformation, such as a shift in public opinion or the birth of new social movements. To sum up, civil disobedience is not necessarily the sole indicator of success, but it may be an effective technique for raising attention to concerns and generating change. When determining whether or not civil disobedience was successful, it is important to look at more than just whether or not policies were changed. Raising awareness, having productive conversations, and altering whole systems are all examples of change that may be counted as positive results.
