I would argue that although if civil disobedience has the potential to be an effective strategy for drawing attention to concerns and igniting change, this is not necessarily the sole criteria that should be used to determine whether or not it has been successful. A sort of protest known as civil disobedience is one that is undertaken with the intention of upsetting the established order and drawing attention to problems that are not being addressed by the government or other authorities. Civil disobedience may, in many instances, result in a change in policy; nevertheless, this should not be the only consequence that is taken into consideration. It is crucial to remember that the goal of civil disobedience is not necessarily meant to be an instant change in legislation. Rather, the goal of civil disobedience is to bring attention to a problem and educate the general public about it. It also has the potential to open the door for debate and negotiation, both of which may result in more long-term solutions than would be possible if the sole objective was a change in policy. In addition to this, rather than just resulting in a shift in policy, it has the potential to bring about a more fundamental and extensive societal transformation. In addition, the fact that civil disobedience does not result in a change in policy does not indicate that it is fruitless or a failure. Civil disobedience has the potential to act as a catalyst for change in policy, despite the fact that it may take some time and need a persistent effort. In addition to this, it may also result in other kinds of shifts, such as a shift in public opinion or the beginning of new social movements, both of which are types of change. Civil disobedience may be an effective method for raising attention to concerns and initiating change; however, this is not necessarily the only criterion that can be used to determine whether or not it has been successful. When determining whether or not civil disobedience was successful, policy change should not be the only consequence that is taken into consideration. Other kinds of shifts, such as increased awareness, conversation, and even systemic shifts, may also be seen as good results in their own right.
