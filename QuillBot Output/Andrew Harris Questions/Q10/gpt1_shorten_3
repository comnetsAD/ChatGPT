Civil disobedience does not have to affect policy to succeed. Civil disobedience is a non-violent type of protest that draws attention to a problem and promotes change, but it is not the only approach. Civil disobedience may increase awareness of a problem, but it may not affect policy. It may draw attention to government-ignored concerns, but it may not be the greatest strategy to handle complicated, multi-faceted situations. After a successful civil disobedience movement, policy change may take time. Civil disobedience is a powerful weapon for change, but it should be utilized with other types of action including lobbying, advocacy, and grassroots organization. In conclusion, civil disobedience is an essential form of non-violent opposition, but it is not the only means to influence policy. It may increase awareness and attention to a problem, but it may not be the best method to influence policy. Even after a successful civil disobedience campaign, policy change may take time. It should be utilized in concert with lobbying, advocacy, and grassroots organization.
