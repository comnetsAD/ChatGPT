It is incorrect to state that civil disobedience should only result in a change in policy and that it is a failure if it does not. Civil disobedience is a non-violent type of protest and resistance that tries to draw attention to a particular problem and effect change, although it is not the only means of doing so. Although civil disobedience may be a powerful tool for drawing attention to a problem, it is not always the best strategy to alter the way policies are implemented. For instance, it may be an effective technique to draw attention to concerns that the government is not addressing, but it might not be the greatest strategy for dealing with complicated situations that call for a multifaceted approach. In addition, even after a successful campaign of civil disobedience, changing policies may be a long process and take time. Additionally, civil disobedience may be a potent instrument for bringing about change, but it is not the only one. As such, it should be utilized in concert with other activism strategies including lobbying, advocacy, and grassroots organization. As a result, even while civil disobedience is a significant type of nonviolent protest and resistance, it shouldn't be seen as the sole means of bringing about policy change. Although it is a potent technique for drawing attention to a problem, changing policy is not always best accomplished this way. Even after a successful civil disobedience campaign, policy change may be a difficult process and may not happen right away. For this reason, civil disobedience should be utilized in combination with other types of activism including lobbying, advocacy, and grassroots organization.
