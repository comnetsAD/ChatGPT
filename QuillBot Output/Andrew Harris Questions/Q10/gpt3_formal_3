I would argue that although civil disobedience may be an effective technique for raising attention to concerns and igniting change, it is not necessarily the only criterion for measuring its effectiveness. Civil disobedience is a kind of protest meant to disturb the status quo and draw attention to concerns that the government and other authorities are not addressing. In many instances, civil disobedience may result in a change in policy, but this is not the only consequence to consider. Important to remember is that civil disobedience is not necessarily meant to result in rapid legislative change, but also to raise awareness and educate the public about an issue. It may also provide a chance for debate and negotiation, which can lead to more durable solutions than policy change alone. In addition to a policy shift, it may also lead to structural and systemic changes in the society. In addition, the fact that civil disobedience does not result in a change in policy does not indicate its failure. Civil disobedience may act as a catalyst for policy change, which can be a lengthy process requiring consistent effort. In addition, it may lead to other types of transformation, such as a shift in public opinion or the formation of new social movements. In conclusion, although civil disobedience may be an effective technique for raising attention to concerns and igniting change, this is not necessarily the only criterion for measuring its effectiveness. When analyzing the effectiveness of civil disobedience, policy change should not be the only metric taken into account. As beneficial results, we may also include awareness-raising, discourse, and structural change.
