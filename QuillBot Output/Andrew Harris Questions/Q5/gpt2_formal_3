The argument that violence or the fear of violence may be a beneficial factor in reducing or adapting to climate change is not correct. Violence is destructive and hurtful; it should never be advocated as a solution to any issue. It may result in loss of life, bodily harm, and property damage, as well as great emotional and psychological pain. In addition, violence may exacerbate division and impede the creation of constructive solutions. Climate change is a complicated problem that requires a multifaceted strategy, including mitigation and adaptation measures, as well as the cooperation and participation of several parties, including governments, corporations, and civil society groups. The use or threat of violence can only impede the positive discourse, cooperation, and teamwork required to overcome this situation. In addition, violence and the prospect of violence may disproportionately hurt disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, who are often the first and most impacted by climate change's effects. Instead of turning to violence, it is essential to seek inclusive and equitable solutions that respect the rights and requirements of these people. Violence and the fear of violence are never constructive in tackling climate change or any other problem. They result in detrimental and damaging outcomes, and they impede the creation of creative solutions. The complexity of climate change necessitates a multifaceted approach, cooperation, and collaboration, and it is essential to strive towards inclusive and equitable solutions that respect the rights and needs of disadvantaged and vulnerable people.
