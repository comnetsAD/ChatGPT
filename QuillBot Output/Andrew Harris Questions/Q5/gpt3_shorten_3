Violence or the fear of violence is a risky and misguided way to mitigate or adapt to climate change. Violence is never useful. Violence first and foremost wreaks havoc and worsens climate change. Violence compounds the devastation caused by climate change. It may kill, injure, and demolish homes, businesses, and infrastructure. Violence hinders climate change mitigation and adaptation. It delays policies, technologies, and initiatives that cut greenhouse gas emissions, boost energy efficiency, and safeguard vulnerable people. It fosters fear and distrust, which hinders governance, organization, and individual cooperation. Violence doesn't solve climate change either. Human activity, environmental processes, economic and political institutions, and climate change are interconnected. Violence perpetuates these root issues. Finally, violence never helps mitigate or adapt to climate change. It wrecks mitigation and adaptation efforts and doesn't address climate change's causes. This global issue requires peaceful, cooperative solutions. Instead of violence, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote energy efficiency, and safeguard vulnerable people.
