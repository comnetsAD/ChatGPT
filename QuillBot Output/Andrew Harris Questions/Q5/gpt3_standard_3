It is seriously mistaken and hazardous to think that using violence or the fear of using violence may help society mitigate or adapt to climate change. Violence can never be beneficial since it is always detrimental. Violence mostly causes havoc and devastation, which may increase the consequences of climate change. Violence just makes the already catastrophic effects of climate change on communities throughout the globe worse. In addition to destroying infrastructure, homes, companies, and relocation, it may also result in injury and death. Violence also thwarts attempts to adapt to or reduce climate change. It obstructs the creation and use of initiatives, technologies, and regulations that may aid in the protection of vulnerable groups, the advancement of energy efficiency, and the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, it fosters an atmosphere of suspicion and dread that may make it difficult for governments, businesses, and people to work together. Violence also doesn't address the underlying causes of climate change. A complex network of elements, including human activity, environmental processes, and economic and political institutions, are responsible for climate change. These root reasons are not addressed by violence, which sometimes even makes them worse. Violence is never a useful force, especially when it comes to preventing or adjusting to climate change. It produces havoc and devastation, thwarts attempts to ameliorate or adapt, and ignores the underlying causes of climate change. To solve this global issue, we must come up with peaceful and collaborative solutions. Instead of using violence, efforts should concentrate on lowering greenhouse gas emissions, boosting energy efficiency, and safeguarding vulnerable people.
