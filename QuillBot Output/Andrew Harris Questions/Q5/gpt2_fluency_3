It is incorrect to assert that violence or the fear of violence may be a beneficial factor in reducing or adapting to climate change. Violence is divisive and hurtful, and it should never be pushed as a solution to any situation. It may result in death, injuries, and property damage, as well as enormous emotional and psychological distress. Furthermore, violence may exacerbate division and stymie the emergence of constructive alternatives. Climate change is a complicated problem that requires a multifaceted response that involves both mitigation and adaptation measures, as well as the cooperation and participation of a diverse group of players, including governments, corporations, and civil society groups. The use of violence or the fear of violence would only stymie the positive discourse, cooperation, and teamwork required to overcome this situation. Furthermore, violence and the prospect of violence may disproportionately hurt disadvantaged and vulnerable populations, who are often the first and most impacted by climate change's effects. Instead of turning to violence, it is critical to strive toward inclusive and equitable solutions that respect these communities' rights and needs. Finally, violence and the fear of violence are never useful forces in dealing with climate change or any other problem. They have damaging and detrimental implications and can only stymie the development of positive alternatives. Climate change is a complicated problem that requires a multifaceted approach, cooperation, and collaboration; thus, it is critical to strive toward inclusive and equitable solutions that respect the rights and needs of disadvantaged and vulnerable people.
