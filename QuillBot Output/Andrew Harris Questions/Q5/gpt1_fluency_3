Human ideas cause climate change. Our ideas and values impact our understanding and response to climate change, which is both physical and political. Our ideas about climate change's origins, effects, and remedies affect how we behave and how well. First, our ideas about climate change's causes impact our understanding and who we blame. If we think climate change is natural, we may not limit our emissions. However, if we realize that burning fossil fuels and deforestation are the main causes of climate change, we are more inclined to cut our personal emissions and support efforts to reduce emissions globally. Second, our climate change views affect our priorities. If we think climate change would only effect future generations, we may not act quickly. However, if we realize that climate change is already generating significant consequences like sea level rise, extreme weather events, and relocation, we are more inclined to take quick action to decrease emissions and adapt. Finally, our climate change solutions beliefs affect our actions. If we think climate change solutions are too expensive or complicated, we may be less inclined to support legislation and cut emissions. However, if we realize that renewable energy, energy efficiency, and reforestation are cost-effective and viable, we are more inclined to support legislation and cut emissions. Finally, human ideas affect climate change understanding and response. Our ideas about climate change's origins, effects, and remedies affect how we behave and how well. Thus, we must continue to educate ourselves and others on climate change research and critically analyze our own ideas. We can only effectively handle this worldwide problem if we do so.
