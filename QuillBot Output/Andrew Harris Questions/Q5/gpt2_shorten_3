Violence cannot mitigate or adapt to climate change. Violence should never be offered as a solution. It may cause death, injury, property damage, and emotional and psychological distress. Violence also polarizes and hampers solution-finding. Climate change is a difficult subject that needs cooperation and collaboration from governments, corporations, and civil society groups to mitigate and adapt. Violence or the fear of violence only hinders productive communication, cooperation, and teamwork to solve this problem. Violence and the prospect of violence may also disproportionately hurt disadvantaged and vulnerable groups, who are most impacted by climate change. Instead of violence, inclusive and fair solutions that respect these groups' rights and needs are needed. Finally, violence and the fear of violence never help solve climate change or other issues. They do damage and prevent productive solutions. Climate change is difficult and requires cooperation, collaboration, and inclusive and equitable solutions that respect disadvantaged and vulnerable populations' rights and needs.
