Violence or the fear of violence is a risky way to mitigate or adapt to climate change. Violence never helps people, communities, or the environment. Climate change demands collaboration between government, business, and civil society. Violence or the fear of violence disrupts this collaboration and may cause further splits. Violence destroys natural resources, which works against climate change mitigation and adaptation. It may also cause population relocation, worsening climate change. Climate change disproportionately affects underprivileged and vulnerable groups. Violence against these communities will worsen their misery and is immoral. Finally, violence or the fear of violence does not mitigate or adapt to climate change. Climate change demands collaboration, negotiation, and nonviolent dispute resolution. Peaceful, sustainable climate change solutions need collaboration.
