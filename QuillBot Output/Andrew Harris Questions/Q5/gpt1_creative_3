Misguided and potentially harmful is the belief that violence or the fear of violence may be a beneficial factor in countering or adapting to climate change. Using violence to solve a problem is never effective and almost always has negative consequences. The multifaceted nature of climate change necessitates concerted efforts from government at all levels, business, and civil society. The use of, or threat of using, violence hinders collaboration and may spark new disputes and divides. Furthermore, violence may have an adverse effect on the environment by leading to the loss of natural resources, which works against the objective of reducing or adapting to climate change. The effects of climate change are made worse since it might cause people to leave their homes and communities. It's also worth noting that many underrepresented and vulnerable groups feel the effects of climate change more acutely than others. It is immoral to employ violence against these communities since it will only make their situation worse. Finally, the use of force or the threat of force is counterproductive in efforts to lessen the effects of climate change or adapt to them. As a result, tackling climate change requires a concerted effort that prioritizes collaboration, open communication, and dispute resolution without resorting to violence. The problems caused by climate change need cooperative efforts to develop peaceful, long-term solutions.
