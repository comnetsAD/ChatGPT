Improved readability and maintainability: When programming, being nice and orderly makes it simpler for others (or even yourself in the future) to read and comprehend your code. Indentation, commenting, and sensible variable names, for example, may assist others in rapidly understanding the logic and structure of your code. This makes identifying errors, making modifications, and expanding on the current codebase easy. This, in turn, may improve the codebase's maintainability and efficiency for future development. Increased efficiency: Being tidy and structured when programming might help you become a more efficient coder. It is simpler to discover and solve issues, create new features, and comprehend the general flow of the program when your code has a clear and structured structure. Furthermore, keeping your code nice and orderly makes it simpler to debug and solve any difficulties that may develop. This will save you time and effort in the long term, as well as make you more productive. To summarize, being tidy and structured when programming is vital since it enhances the readability, maintainability, and efficiency of your code, making you a better and more efficient programmer.
