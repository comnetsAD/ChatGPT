Increased readability and maintainability Using consistent indentation, commenting, and understandable variable names, for example, may aid others in rapidly comprehending your code's logic and structure. This makes it simpler to detect errors, implement modifications, and expand upon the current codebase. This may boost the maintainability of the codebase and make future development more efficient. Increased productivity: Being tidy and orderly when programming may also boost your productivity as a programmer. It is simpler to find and repair issues, introduce new features, and comprehend the general flow of the program if the code has a clear and structured structure. In addition, by keeping your code clean and well-organized, you may make it simpler to debug and fix any potential difficulties. This may save you time and effort over time, as well as increase your productivity. In conclusion, it is crucial to be tidy and structured while programming since it enhances the readability, maintainability, and efficiency of your code, hence making you a better and more efficient programmer.
