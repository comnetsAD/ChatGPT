Easier to read and comprehend: When code is well-organized and simple to read, others (including yourself) can grasp what the program is doing and how it works. This may make maintaining and updating the code, as well as collaborating with others on the project, much simpler. Errors and defects are reduced: Code that is well-organized and simple to comprehend is less likely to include mistakes and defects. This is because beautifully structured code makes it simpler to discover and repair errors, and it makes it less likely that new flaws will be created while making modifications to the code. Furthermore, well-organized code is frequently more efficient since it is simpler to identify and address performance bottlenecks.
