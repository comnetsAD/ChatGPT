When code is well-organized and simple to read, it is much simpler for others (and yourself) to comprehend what the program is doing and how it operates. This may make it much simpler to maintain and update the code, as well as work on the project with others. Fewer mistakes and bugs: Error- and bug-free code is more likely to be well-organized and simple to understand. While the code is well-organized, it is simpler to identify and repair errors, and it is less likely that new defects will be created when making modifications. Additionally, well-organized code is often more efficient since it is simpler to identify and eliminate performance bottlenecks.
