Readability is increased when you program in a tidy and structured manner, since this makes it simpler for other people to read and comprehend the code you write. This is of utmost significance if you are working with other people on a project or whenever it is anticipated that your code may at some point in the future need maintenance or revisions by other people. Your code will be easier to understand if you use naming standards, indentation that is clear and uniform across lines, and comments. Error prevention may be achieved by maintaining tidiness and organization throughout the programming process. It is far more challenging to detect and correct errors in code that is cluttered and poorly arranged. If you maintain order and structure inside your code, it will be much simpler to identify and resolve any problems that may crop up in the future. In addition, by adhering to good programming techniques such as commenting, it is simpler to comprehend the objective of the code, which will make it easier for you to locate any problems or defects in a more timely manner.
