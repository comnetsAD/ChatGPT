When the code is well-organized and simple to read, it is much simpler for others, as well as for yourself, to comprehend what the program is doing and how it operates. This is because it is easier to read the code. Because of this, it can become much simpler to both maintain and update the code, as well as work together with other people on the project. Fewer mistakes and bugs: It is far more probable that a piece of code will not have any mistakes or problems if it is well-organized and simple to understand. When the code is well-organized, issues are simpler to locate and correct, and it reduces the likelihood that new flaws will be produced when modifications are made to the code. This is one of the reasons why this is the case. In addition, code that is well-organized is often more effective since it is simpler to identify and eliminate performance bottlenecks.
