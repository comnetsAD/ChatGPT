Being tidy and orderly while programming makes your code simpler to read and comprehend. This is essential when working in a team or when others may need to maintain or update your code in the future. Clear and uniform indentation, commenting, and naming standards all contribute to the readability of your code. Error reduction: Being tidy and structured while programming may also aid in error reduction. When code is unorganized and disorderly, it is more difficult to locate and repair errors. By maintaining an orderly and well-structured codebase, it becomes simpler to discover and resolve any potential difficulties. In addition, proper programming standards, such as commenting, make it simpler to comprehend the meaning of the code, which expedites the identification of problems and mistakes.
