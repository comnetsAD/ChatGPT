Readability and maintainability are both enhanced when programming is done in a nice and structured manner, since this makes it simpler for others (and even for you in the future) to read and comprehend the code that you have written. By using practices like as consistent indentation, meaningful commenting, and meaningful variable naming, for example, you may make it easier for others to comprehend the logic and the structure of your code. This makes it much simpler to locate errors, to make modifications, and to build upon the coding that already exists. This, in turn, may improve the codebase's maintainability and make it more efficient for development in the future. Increased productivity Keeping your workspace clean and orderly as you create is one way to boost your productivity overall as a computer programmer. Finding and fixing issues, adding new features, and comprehending how the program works as a whole are all made simpler when the structure of the code is well-defined and well-organized. In addition, if you maintain your code clean and well-organized, it will be much simpler for you to debug and solve any problems that may crop up in the future. This may, in the long run, save you time and effort while also assisting you in being more effective in your work. In conclusion, maintaining tidiness and organization when you are programming is essential since it enhances the readability, maintainability, and efficiency of your code, which, in turn, may make you a better and more effective programmer.
