The readability of your code will increase if you take the time to keep it clean and well-organized. When working in a team or if others may need to make changes or updates to your code in the future, this is crucial. Your code will be easier to understand if you use consistent indentation, comments, and naming conventions. Errors are less likely to occur if the programmer is tidy and structured. It's harder to detect and solve flaws in chaotic and disordered code. Maintaining a clean and well-structured codebase makes it simpler to identify and resolve bugs. Good programming methods, such as commenting, make it simpler to comprehend the code's purpose and hence aid in the detection of mistakes and problems.
