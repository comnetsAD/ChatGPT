Improved readability: When programming, being nice and orderly makes it simpler for others to read and comprehend your code. This is especially crucial if you work on a team or if others may need to maintain or update your code in the future. Clear and uniform indentation, commenting, and naming standards all contribute to better readable code. Error reduction: Being tidy and structured while programming may also aid in error reduction. It is more harder to detect and solve errors when code is sloppy and unstructured. Keeping your code orderly and well-structured makes it simpler to find and repair any problems that may develop. Furthermore, by using appropriate programming methods such as commenting, you may better understand the meaning of the code, which can help you find any flaws or mistakes faster.
