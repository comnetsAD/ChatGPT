Better readability and maintainability: When you program, being nice and orderly makes it simpler for others to read and comprehend your codeâ€”or even for you in the future. Others may more easily comprehend the logic and structure of your code by adopting techniques like consistent indentation, commenting, and understandable variable names. This makes it simpler to find errors, make modifications, and expand upon the current codebase. This in turn may improve the codebase's maintainability and efficiency for future growth. Efficiency gain: Programming neatly and efficiently may help you become a more effective programmer. It is simpler to find and repair issues, add new features, and comprehend the program's general flow when your code is ordered and clear. Additionally, by maintaining a clean and structured code structure, you may make it simpler to diagnose and debug any potential problems. In the long term, this may save you time and effort and increase your productivity. As a result, programming neatly and efficiently may help you become a better and more effective programmer by increasing the readability, maintainability, and efficiency of your code.
