More people (or perhaps you in the future) will be able to read and comprehend your code with better organization and tidiness in the programming environment. Using practices like consistent indentation, comments, and understandable variable names may aid in making your code's logic and structure more accessible to others. Fixing issues, incorporating new features, and expanding upon the current framework are all simplified as a result. This, in turn, may improve the codebase's maintainability and make new features easier to implement. If you take pride in your work and keep things nice and organized, you may boost your personal productivity as a programmer. Finding and fixing errors, adding new features, and understanding the program's general flow are all facilitated by a well-organized codebase. In addition, if your code is well-organized, you'll have a simpler time finding and fixing bugs. In addition to making you more effective, this may help you save time and effort over time. In conclusion, maintaining order and cleanliness when coding may help you become a better and more effective developer by increasing your code's readability, maintainability, and efficiency.
