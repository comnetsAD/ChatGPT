The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) vector class enables dynamic arrays. It stores a set of identical items in the <vector> header. Push back(), pop back(), size(), and others let you add, delete, and access vector items. "string": The C++ STL string template class simplifies character string manipulation. It supports concatenation, substring extraction, and character searching in the <string> header. It also provides several string manipulation capabilities like length(), find(), replace(), etc. Vector and string are STL objects, which offer C++ programmers with templates for basic data structures and methods.
