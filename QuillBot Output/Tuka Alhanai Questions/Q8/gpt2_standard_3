The STL "vector" is a class that serves as a container for a group of components of a certain type. It comes from the container library of the STL. Vectors are dynamic arrays that may change in size depending on the addition or removal of members. They provide an array-like interface with constant time access to the elements. When you require a dynamic, resizable array and are unsure of your array's size in advance, they might be helpful. The STL "map" is a class that acts as an associative container and holds objects in a key-value pair manner. It comes from the container library of the STL. Maps provide logarithmic time access to elements and are implemented as balanced binary trees. They come in handy when you need to effectively search up and store items with special keys. Both vector and map are template classes, therefore any data type may be used with them in both situations (int, double, string, custom class, etc).
