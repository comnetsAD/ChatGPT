in C++, the Standard Template Library (STL) provides an object that is referred to as a vector. It is a dynamic array that has a constant time complexity for accessing entries at a certain index, and the size of the array may be changed as needed. The ability to store and modify a collection of components is made possible by this component of the STL's container library. It is a template class, which means that it may carry any form of data such as numbers, strings, or custom classes. Additionally, it includes a set of member methods that include push back, pop back, size, and a few other functions as well. string is an object that is part of the Standard Template Library (STL) in the programming language C++. It is a class that gives you the ability to store and modify strings of character data. It is a template class that is included as part of the string library that is provided by the STL. Because of this, it is able to hold any form of character, including fundamental types such as char and wchar t. It has a group of member functions including length, find, and replace, amongst others. The String class is a practical and effective mechanism for handling and manipulating strings. It offers a wide variety of helpful functions and methods for doing so, and it is also more secure than the C-style strings that are often used.
