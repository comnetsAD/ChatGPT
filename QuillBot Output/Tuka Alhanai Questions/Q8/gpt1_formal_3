It also provides numerous helpful member functions, such as length(), find(), and replace(), that allow for the manipulation of strings in a variety of ways. Vector and string are both elements of the Standard Template Library (STL), a collection of templates for commonly used data structures and algorithms that may be utilized in C++ applications.
