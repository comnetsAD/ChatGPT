vector: The STL "vector" carries items of a given type. STL's container library includes it. Vectors change size when components are added or deleted. They feature array-like interfaces and constant element access. They're handy when you require a dynamic, resizable array without knowing its size. map: STL "map" is a key-value pair associative container class. STL's container library includes it. Maps are balanced binary trees with logarithmic element access. They help store and search up components with unique keys. Vector and map are template classes that work with any data type (int, double, string, custom class, etc).
