An object from the C++ Standard Template Library (STL) is referred to as a vector. It is a dynamic array that has constant time complexity for accessing entries at a given index and may be enlarged. It provides for the storage and manipulation of a group of components and is a component of the STL container library. Because it is a template class, it may carry any kind of data, including strings, integers, and custom classes. It also includes a number of member methods, including push back, pop back, size, and others. String: In C++, the Standard Template Library (STL) contains the object string. It is a class that makes it possible to work with and store character strings. It is a template class that is a component of the STL's string library and can hold any kind of character, including the most fundamental ones like char and wchar t. Its member functions include length, find, replace, and other useful ones. Because it offers many helpful functions and methods to manipulate strings, the String class is a practical and effective way to manage and modify strings. It is also more secure than C-style strings.
