The "vector" class in the Standard Template Library (STL) is a container for storing items of a certain kind. The STL includes this in its container library. It is possible to add or delete items from a vector, causing the array's size to change dynamically. You may access their elements at any moment, and their interface is similar to that of an array. They are in handy when you need an array that can grow or shrink on the go, or when you just don't know how big your array will eventually be. The "map" class in the Standard Template Library (STL) is an associative container that holds items in a key-value pair manner. To put it simply, it is a container in the Standard Template Library. Accessing nodes in a map takes logarithmic time since it is implemented as a balanced binary tree. They come in handy when there's a requirement to effectively store and retrieve data that can be accessed by unique keys. As template classes, vector and map may be used with any kind of data (int, double, string, custom class, etc).
