"vector": The C++ Standard Template Library (STL) supports dynamic arrays through the vector template class. A collection of components of the same type, as stated in the vector> header. The vector's elements may be added, removed, and accessed with the use of the vector's various member methods, such as push back(), pop back(), size(), etc. C++'s STL (Standard Template Library) includes a template class called string for easily manipulating character strings. The string> header defines this data type, which allows string manipulations including concatenation, substring extraction, and character searching. Additionally, it offers a plethora of helpful member methods for working with strings, such as length(), locate(), replace(), etc. The Standard Template Library (STL) is a collection of templates for frequently used data structures and algorithms that may be used in C++ applications; the STL includes the vector and string objects.
