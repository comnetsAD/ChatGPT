The STL "vector" class is a container for a collection of components of a certain type. It is part of the container library of the STL. Vectors are dynamic arrays whose dimensions may expand or contract as items are added or withdrawn. They allow element access in constant time and an array-like interface. They are handy when a dynamic, resizable array is required and the array's size is unknown in advance. STL's "map" class is an associative container that holds items as key-value pairs. It is part of the container library of the STL. Maps are built as balanced binary trees and offer element access in logarithmic time. They are important for storing components with unique keys and effectively retrieving them. vector and map are both template classes, which means they may be used with any data type (int, double, string, custom class, etc).
