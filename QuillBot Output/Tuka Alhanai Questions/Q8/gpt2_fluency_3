vector: A container class in the STL that carries a collection of items of a given type. It is a container library in the STL. Vectors are dynamic arrays that may expand or contract when members are added or withdrawn. They give an array-like interface and provide constant time access to items. They come in handy when you require a dynamic, resizable array and don't know the size of your array ahead of time. map: An associative container class that holds items in a key-value pair fashion. It is a container library in the STL. Maps are implemented as balanced binary trees, and elements may be accessed in logarithmic time. They are handy when you need to store items with unique keys and quickly search them up. Vector and map are both template classes, which means they may be used with any data type (int, double, string, custom class, etc).
