The "vector" class in the Standard Template Library (STL) is a container that stores a collection of items of a certain kind. It is included in the container library that is provided by the STL. Vectors are dynamic arrays that are capable of expanding or contracting in size depending on the number of items that are added or deleted. They give an interface that is similar to an array and have access to the elements at all times. When you require a dynamic and resizable array, but you don't know the size of your array in advance, you may use them to your advantage. map is an associative container class that holds items in a key-value pair format. It is part of the Standard Template Library (STL). It is included in the container library that is provided by the STL. Maps are often implemented as balanced binary trees, which allow for element access in a logarithmic amount of time. They are in handy when there is a requirement to store components that have unique keys and effectively search those components up. In both instances, vector and map are considered to be template classes, which means that they are compatible with any data type (int, double, string, custom class, etc).
