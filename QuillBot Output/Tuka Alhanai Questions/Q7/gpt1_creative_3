Using the same indentation and variable names across your C++ code is one method to keep things looking clean and organized. Some good practices include using the same amount of spaces for indentation throughout your code and naming your variables and functions consistently using camelCase or snake case. As a result, your code will be easier to understand and comprehend. Furthermore, you may give variables, functions, and other parts of your code meaningful names. In this way, it would be easier to understand and read. One further technique for keeping your C++ code tidy and well-organized is to make good use of functions and classes. Modularizing your code into smaller chunks might make it simpler to read and maintain. Groups of similar code may be contained into functions, while data and behavior can be encapsulated within classes. Your code's readability and maintainability may both benefit from this. To further aid people in understanding the code, you may add comments to describe the behavior of each function, class, and variable.
