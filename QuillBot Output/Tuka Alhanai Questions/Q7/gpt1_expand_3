Using indentation and naming conventions that are consistent across your code is one method to make your C++ code seem clean and well-organized. Another way to do this is to use the same name conventions and indentation throughout your code. For instance, you might use the same amount of spaces for all of your indentation, and you could name your variables and functions using either camelCase or snake case. Your code will be easier to read and understand as a result of this change. You might also give the variables, functions, and other components of your code names that have some kind of significance to them. Because of this, it will be easier to understand and read. Utilization of Functions and Classes: Utilizing functions and classes in a productive manner is another method for keeping your C++ code clean and well-organized. You may make your code more manageable and simpler to comprehend by first breaking it down into smaller, modular components, and then breaking each of those sections down further. Classes may be used to organize and encapsulate data and functionality, while functions can be used to gather together sections of code that are connected to one another. The readability and maintainability of your code may both increase as a result of this. You might also use commentary to describe the purpose of each function, class, and variable, which will make it simpler for other people to comprehend the code.
