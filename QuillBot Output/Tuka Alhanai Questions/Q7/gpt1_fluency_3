Consistent indentation and name conventions: Using consistent indentation and naming conventions across your C++ code is one method to make it nice and orderly. For example, you might utilize a constant amount of spaces for indentation and variable and function names in camelCase or snake case. This improves the readability and clarity of your code. You might also give variables, functions, and other code objects meaningful names. This would make it more readable and clear. Use of functions and classes: Using functions and classes efficiently is another approach to make your C++ code nice and orderly. You may make your code more manageable and understandable by splitting it down into smaller, modular sections. Classes may be used to organize and encapsulate data and functionality, whereas functions can be used to group relevant code together. This may increase your code's readability and maintainability. You might also use commentary to clarify the purpose of each function, class, and variable, making it easier for others to grasp the code.
