Consistent indentation and name conventions: Using consistent indentation and naming conventions across your code is one method to keep your C++ code tidy and organized. For instance, you might consistently indent your code with a certain amount of spaces and use camelCase or snake case for variable and function names. This improves the readability and clarity of your code. You might also give your code's variables, functions, and other components meaningful names. This would improve its readability and clarity. Use of functions and classes: Making good use of functions and classes is another technique to structure and neaten up your C++ code. You may make your code more manageable and understandable by dividing it up into smaller, modular sections. Classes may be used to organize and encapsulate data and functionality, whereas functions can be used to bring together relevant code. Your code's readability and maintainability may increase as a result. To make the code easier for others to comprehend, you might also include comments to describe the purpose of each function, class, and variable.
