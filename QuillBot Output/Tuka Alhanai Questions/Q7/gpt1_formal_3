Consistent indentation and name conventions: Using consistent indentation and naming conventions across your C++ code is one method to make it nice and orderly. Use a constant amount of spaces for indentation, and camelCase or snake case for variable and function names. This makes your code easier to understand and comprehend. In addition, you may give variables, functions, and other pieces of your code meaningful names. This would make things clearer and easier to read. Effective usage of functions and classes is another technique to maintain the cleanliness and organization of your C++ code. By dividing your code into smaller, modular chunks, you may make it more approachable and understandable. Classes may be used to organize and encapsulate data and functionality, whereas functions can be used to organize and group similar code. This may enhance the code's readability and maintainability. In addition, you might use comments to clarify the purpose of each function, class, and variable, so facilitating the comprehension of the code by others.
