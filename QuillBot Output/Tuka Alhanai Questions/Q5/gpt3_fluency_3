in comparison to a non-object-oriented approach? The emphasis in object-oriented programming is on generating objects, which are instances of classes, to represent and modify a program's data and behavior. These objects may communicate with one another through methods, and the data they contain is contained and secure from outside access. Non-object-oriented programming, on the other hand, does not depend on the usage of objects and classes. Instead, it concentrates on data-related operations and functions. This information is often global and may be accessed and changed by any element of the application. In summary, an object-oriented strategy emphasizes the usage of objects, classes, and encapsulation, while a non-object-oriented method manipulates global data using procedures and functions.
