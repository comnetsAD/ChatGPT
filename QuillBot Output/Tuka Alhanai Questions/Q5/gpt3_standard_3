coding in contrast to a non-object-oriented strategy? Creating objects, which are instances of classes, to represent and modify the data and behavior of a program is the main goal of object-oriented programming. These objects can communicate with one another by using methods, and the data they hold is contained inside them and shielded from outside access. Instead of using objects and classes, non-object-oriented programming does not. pres os pressing p.s from the world, p.s in the p.s as of the The program as a whole may access and change this data since it is often global. In conclusion, a non-object-oriented method focuses on procedures and functions to manage global data, while an object-oriented approach stresses the usage of objects, classes, and encapsulation.
