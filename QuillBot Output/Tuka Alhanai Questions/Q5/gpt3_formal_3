programming vs non-object-oriented programming? Object-oriented programming focuses on the creation of objects, which are instances of classes, in order to represent and modify a program's data and behavior. These objects may communicate with one another through methods, and their data is contained and secured against external access. Non-object-oriented programming, in contrast, does not use objects and classes. Instead, it concentrates on data-operating techniques and functions. This information is typically accessible and modifiable by all software components. In conclusion, an object-oriented strategy emphasizes the usage of objects, classes, and encapsulation, while a non-object-oriented method manipulates global data via procedures and functions.
