Object-oriented programming is a paradigm that emphasizes the usage of objects and their interactions while designing and writing software. In object-oriented programming, the program consists of objects, which are instances of classes, and the classes are ordered hierarchically according to inheritance. Each object has its own state and behavior, and uses methods and messages to communicate with other objects. Non-object-oriented programming, often known as structured or procedural programming, is a paradigm that emphasizes the use of processes and functions in software design and development. A program is made of a series of instructions and grouped into procedures and functions, which are reusable blocks of code, in structured programming. There is no data encapsulation, and the state of the program is shared across all procedures and functions. The primary distinction between an object-oriented approach to programming and a non-object-oriented approach is the manner in which the code is organized and structured. Object-oriented programming arranges code around objects, which are instances of classes, and emphasizes how these objects interact. Control flow is the focal point of non-object-oriented programming, which arranges code around processes and functions. Non-object-oriented programming does not provide data encapsulation and abstraction, but object-oriented programming can. This makes object-oriented programming simpler to comprehend and maintain.
