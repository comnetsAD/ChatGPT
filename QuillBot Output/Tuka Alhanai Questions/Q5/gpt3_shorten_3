programming vs non-object-oriented? In object-oriented programming, objects—class instances—represent and modify a program's data and behavior. Methods allow these things to communicate and safeguard their data. Non-object-oriented programming does not employ objects or classes. Instead, it emphasizes data-processing functions. Any software section may access and modify this global data. Object-oriented programming emphasizes objects, classes, and encapsulation, whereas non-object-oriented programming uses procedures and functions to manage global data.
