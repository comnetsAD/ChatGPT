programming against conventional methods of code construction? Object-oriented programming is a style of computer programming that emphasizes the creation of objectsâ€”specific implementations of a class's protocols and protocols' data and behavior. Data inside these objects is enclosed and secured from outside access while yet allowing for interaction between them through methods. Non-object-oriented programming, on the other hand, does not depend on objects and classes. Instead, it emphasizes data-processing algorithms and functions. This information is often shared throughout the whole application. In conclusion, a non-object-oriented method uses procedures and functions to manage global data, whereas an object-oriented approach places a premium on the usage of objects, classes, and encapsulation.
