programming in comparison to a technique that is not object-oriented? Object-oriented programming places an emphasis on the creation of objects, which are essentially instances of classes that may be used to represent and modify a program's data as well as its behavior. These objects are able to communicate with one another by using methods, and the data that they bring together is encapsulated so that it cannot be accessed from the outside. In contrast, programming that is not object-oriented does not depend on the usage of classes and objects in the way that object-oriented programming does. In its place, it places an emphasis on the processes and functions that are performed on data. This data is often stored on a global level, meaning that it may be accessed and altered by any component of the program. To summarize, an object-oriented method places more of an emphasis on the usage of objects, classes, and encapsulation, while a non-object-oriented approach depends on procedures and functions to modify global data. Encapsulation refers to the act of enclosing information inside an object.
