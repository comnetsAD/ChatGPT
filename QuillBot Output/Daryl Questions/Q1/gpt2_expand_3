Abraham Maslow is credited with developing the idea of a "hierarchy of wants," one of which is the "desire to belong." It is a human urge to develop and sustain strong connections with other people, such as those with family, friends, and love partners, and it is referred to as the "social need." This need is seen to be essential to the mental and emotional health of humans, since it is regarded as one of the most basic human motivations. In a variety of different ways, people's urge to belong may be satisfied by using social media, which might be troublesome. One of the problems that might arise from using social media is an increase in emotions of being alone and disconnected from others. According to a number of studies, those who spend a greater amount of time on social media tend to experience increased degrees of loneliness as well as despair. People are often provided with well edited and filtered portrayals of the lives of their peers on social media, which may add to feelings of social comparison and inadequacy. In conclusion, the use of social media may result in the formation of "echo chambers," in which individuals only engage in conversation with those who have the same viewpoints as them and are thus unlikely to be exposed to a variety of points of view.
