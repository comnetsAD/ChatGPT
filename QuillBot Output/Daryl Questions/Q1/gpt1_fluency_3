The psychological need to make and sustain social ties with others is referred to as the need to belong. According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the desire to belong, along with physiological necessities, safety, esteem, and self-actualization, is a basic human need. Because it may generate a false feeling of connection, social media can be troublesome in satisfying people's desire to belong. People on social media may have a large number of "friends" and followers, but these relationships may not be meaningful or real. Furthermore, by emphasising the social ties and experiences of others, social media may prolong emotions of isolation and loneliness, leading to feelings of inadequacy and poor self-esteem. Social media comparison is another major element that might lead to mental health problems.
