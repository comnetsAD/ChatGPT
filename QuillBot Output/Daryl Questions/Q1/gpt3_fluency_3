The need to belong, according to Maslow's hierarchy of wants, is a basic human need that encompasses the need for social contact, love, and a feeling of connection with others. It is one of the fundamental human wants that must be met in order for a person to feel full and content in life. Social media, on the other hand, may be troublesome in terms of satisfying people's desire to belong since it can generate a false feeling of connection and belonging. People might be mislead by fake personas on social media because they can offer an idealized vision of themselves. People who believe they are not living up to the standards portrayed by others on social media may experience feelings of loneliness as a result of their use of social media. Furthermore, when individuals compare their own lives to the highlight reels of other people's lives, social media may develop sentiments of jealously and inadequacy.
