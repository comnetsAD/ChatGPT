According to Maslow's hierarchy of wants, the need for social contact, love, and a feeling of connection with others are all parts of the need to belong, which is a basic human need. In order for someone to feel pleased and fulfilled in life, one of their fundamental human wants must be met. However, since it may foster a false feeling of connection and belonging, social media can be troublesome in sating people's desire to belong. Social media gives users the chance to exhibit an idealized image of themselves, and this false persona has the potential to deceive users. Social media may also make individuals feel lonely because they may believe they fall short of the standards others on the site set for themselves. Social media may also promote emotions of inadequacy and jealousy since users may contrast their own lives with the highlight reels of others' lives.
