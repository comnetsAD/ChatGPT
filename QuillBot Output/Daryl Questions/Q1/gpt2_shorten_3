Abraham Maslow's hierarchy of wants includes "belonging." Humans require deep ties with family, friends, and love partners. This urge is considered a basic human motivator and essential for emotional well-being. Social media may exacerbate people's urge to belong in many ways. Social media may cause loneliness and isolation. Studies reveal that social media users are more lonely and depressed. As individuals see well edited and filtered representations of their friends' lives on social media, they may feel inadequate. Finally, social media may create "echo chambers" where users only engage with others who share their ideas, limiting their exposure to different viewpoints.
