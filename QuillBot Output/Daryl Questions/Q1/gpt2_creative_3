Abraham Maslow included a "need to belong" in his hierarchy of wants. It's the desire for and pursuit of meaningful connections with other people, both those within one's own family and social circle and with those beyond it. This need is thought to be one of our most basic drives, and satisfying it is essential to our mental and emotional well. There are a variety of ways in which the use of social media to satisfy people's desire to feel included might be problematic. Isolation and loneliness are problems that might arise from using social media. Research has indicated that social media users are more likely to feel lonely and depressed. Furthermore, individuals are typically provided with finely edited and filtered portrayals of their peers' life on social media, which may lead to feelings of social comparison and inadequacy. Last but not least, social media may cause users to become isolated in "echo chambers," where they only engage with those who share their views and are thus unlikely to be exposed to new ideas.
