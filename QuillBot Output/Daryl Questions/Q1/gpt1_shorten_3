Social connection is the psychological yearning to belong. Maslow's hierarchy of needs lists belonging, safety, esteem, and self-actualization as basic human wants. Social media may give users a false feeling of belonging. Social media "friends" and following may be superficial. Social media may sometimes make people feel insecure and isolated by showcasing others' social relationships and experiences. Social media comparison is another major mental health risk factor.
