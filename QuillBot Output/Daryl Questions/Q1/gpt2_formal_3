Abraham Maslow developed the notion of "need to belong" in his hierarchy of wants. It refers to the urge of humans to develop and sustain strong connections with others, including family, friends, and romantic partners. This urge is seen as a basic human motivator and is thought to be essential for emotional health. In a variety of ways, fueling people's urge to belong via social media may be troublesome. The usage of social media may lead to feelings of loneliness and isolation, which is a problem. According to studies, those who spend more time on social media are more likely to experience loneliness and sadness. Moreover, social media may add to emotions of social comparison and inadequacy since users are often exposed to well managed and edited portrayals of their peers' lives. Lastly, social media may contribute to the formation of "echo chambers," in which individuals only communicate with others who share their ideas and may not be exposed to a variety of viewpoints.
