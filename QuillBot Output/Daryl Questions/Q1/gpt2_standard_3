Abraham Maslow included the idea of the "need to belong" in his hierarchy of wants. It alludes to people's urge to establish and preserve strong bonds with loved ones, friends, and romantic interests. This urge is seen to be essential for emotional well-being and is regarded as a basic human motive. Social media may be problematic in a variety of ways when it comes to satisfying people's urge to belong. The usage of social media may contribute to feelings of isolation and loneliness, which is one problem. According to studies, persons who use social media more often likely to experience greater loneliness and sadness. Social media may further exacerbate feelings of inferiority and social comparison since users are often exposed to finely edited and filtered depictions of the lives of their peers. Last but not least, social media may result in the development of "echo chambers," where users only communicate with others who share their views and may not be exposed to a variety of viewpoints.
