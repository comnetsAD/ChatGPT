The term "need to belong" is used to describe a human psychological need to create and sustain social bonds. Maslow identified five basic human needs, including food, shelter, safety, respect, and self-actualization. Belonging to a community is at the top of this list. Feeding people's yearning to belong via social media may be harmful since it often leads to an illusory feeling of community. People may have a large number of "friends" and "following" on social media, yet these ties may be superficial and insincere. As a result of its emphasis on the relationships and accomplishments of others, social media may also contribute to feelings of inferiority and depression by isolating its users. One of the key factors that might lead to a mental health problem is engaging in unhealthy social comparison on social media.
