According to Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the need to belong is at the top of the list of essential human wants. This need encompasses the yearning for love, social contact, and a feeling of connection with other people. It is one of the fundamental requirements of a human being that must be met in order for a person to have a sense of accomplishment and contentment in their life. To satisfy people's desire to belong, however, social media may be problematic since it can generate a false feeling of connection and belonging among its users. People have the ability to offer an idealized picture of themselves on social media, and other users might be led astray by this false persona they create. People may have the perception that they are not living up to the standards displayed by others on social media, which may lead to feelings of loneliness. This perception can be caused by social media. People have a tendency to compare their own lives to the high points of other people's lives, which may give rise to emotions of jealously and inadequacy. Social media can contribute to these sentiments.
