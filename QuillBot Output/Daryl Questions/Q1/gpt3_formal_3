According to Maslow's hierarchy of wants, the need to belong comprises the need for social engagement, affection, and a feeling of connection with others. It is one of the fundamental human wants that must be met for a person to feel full and content in life. However, social media may generate a false feeling of connection and belonging, which can be troublesome for satisfying people's desire to belong. Social media enables individuals to offer an idealized picture of themselves, which might mislead others. People may feel that they are not living up to the standards exhibited by others on social media, leading to feelings of loneliness. People may compare their own lives to the highlight reels of other people's lives, which may lead to emotions of jealously and inadequacy.
