The psychological need to establish and preserve social ties with others is referred to as the desire to belong. The desire to belong is one of the basic human wants, along with safety, esteem, and self-actualization, according to Maslow's hierarchy of needs. Social media may be problematic in that it can give users a false feeling of connection, which might fuel their urge to belong. On social media, someone may have a large number of "friends" and followers, but these relationships may not be real or significant. By emphasizing the social relationships and experiences of others, social media may also reinforce emotions of loneliness and isolation, which can result in poor self-esteem and feelings of inadequacy. Social comparison on social media is another important component that might cause problems with one's mental health.
