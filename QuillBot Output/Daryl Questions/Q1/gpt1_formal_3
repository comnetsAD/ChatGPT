The psychological need to make and sustain social ties with others is referred to as the need to belong. Along with physiological requirements, safety, self-esteem, and self-actualization, Maslow's hierarchy of needs identifies the desire for belonging as a basic human need. Because it may generate a false feeling of connection, social media can be troublesome for satisfying people's desire to belong. On social media, someone may have numerous "friends" and followers, but these relationships may not be meaningful or authentic. In addition, social media may exacerbate feelings of isolation and loneliness by emphasizing the social ties and experiences of others, which can result in feelings of inadequacy and poor self-esteem. Additionally, social comparison on social media is one of the leading causes of mental health issues.
