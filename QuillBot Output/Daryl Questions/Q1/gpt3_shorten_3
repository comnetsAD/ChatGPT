Maslow's hierarchy of needs states that humans need to belong, which includes the need for social engagement, affection, and a feeling of connection. To feel pleased and content in life, one must satisfy this essential human need. Social media may generate a false feeling of belonging, which might fuel people's urge to belong. People might deceive others by presenting an idealized self on social media. People may feel alone on social media if they don't meet others' standards. Social media may also make individuals feel inferior by comparing their life to others' highlight reels.
