Maslow identified the need for social contact, affection, and a feeling of connection with others as part of the basic human need for belonging. In order to feel whole and content in one's life, it is one of the most fundamental requirements that must be met. Social media may be problematic in that it can give individuals a phony feeling of connection and belonging, which can fuel their urge to belong but can be harmful in the long run. People might project an unrealistically positive image of themselves on social media, leading others astray. Isolation is another another side effect of social media use, as users may feel they are falling short of the standards given by their peers. And since it's so easy to see just the best moments of other people's life, social media can sometimes make us feel inadequate and envious.
