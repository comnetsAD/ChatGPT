Abraham Maslow suggested the "need to belong" in his hierarchy of wants. It refers to the human need to develop and sustain strong bonds with people, such as family, friends, and love partners. This urge is seen as a basic human motivator and is thought to be required for emotional well-being. In a variety of ways, social media may be troublesome in terms of satisfying people's desire to belong. One disadvantage of using social media is that it may cause feelings of loneliness and isolation. According to studies, those who spend more time on social media report increased symptoms of loneliness and sadness. Furthermore, since users are often provided with finely edited and filtered images of their peers' lives, social media may add to feelings of social comparison and inadequacy. Finally, social media may contribute to the formation of "echo chambers," in which users only communicate with others who share their views and are not exposed to a broad variety of viewpoints.
