A person's psychological urge to establish and sustain social ties with other people is referred to as the "need to belong." In Maslow's hierarchy of needs, the desire to belong is ranked among physiological requirements, the need for safety, the need for esteem, and the need to actualize one's potential as one of the most basic human wants. Because it may provide users an illusion of connection, social media platforms can pose a challenge when it comes to satisfying their desire to feel like they belong. Even though a person may have a large number of "friends" and followers on social media, these relationships may not be real or significant. In addition, since social media platforms tend to emphasize the social connections and experiences of others, they may contribute to the perpetuation of emotions of isolation and loneliness, which in turn can lead to feelings of inadequacy and poor self-esteem. One of the primary contributors to mental health problems is engaging in unhealthy social comparisons on social media platforms.
