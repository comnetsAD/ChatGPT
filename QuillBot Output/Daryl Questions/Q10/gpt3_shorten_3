Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT) states that how a person analyzes and understands a circumstance affects their emotions. CAT says first and secondary assessments might cause worry and terror. Primary assessment assesses a situation's impact on an individual's well-being. If someone hears a gunshot in an unfamiliar city at night, they may think it's unsafe. Thus, worry and dread may arise suddenly. Secondary assessment evaluates one's competence to handle the circumstance. An individual's secondary judgment may be that they are unprepared for a driving test, which causes dread of failing. This dread may last longer and be stronger than gunshot terror. In conclusion, how one perceives a situation affects anxiety and terror. The gunshot's main assessment is that it's harmful, whereas the driving test's secondary appraisal is that the person may not be ready.
