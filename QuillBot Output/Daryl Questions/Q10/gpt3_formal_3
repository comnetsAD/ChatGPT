Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT) states that an individual's evaluation and interpretation of a circumstance determines their emotional experience. According to CAT, there are two sorts of evaluations that might contribute to anxiety and fear: primary and secondary evaluations. Primary assessment is the first evaluation of a situation in terms of its possible influence on the well-being of a person. In the event that a person unexpectedly hears a gunshot in an unfamiliar city at night, their first assessment would likely be that the situation is hazardous and threatens their safety. The person may suffer a rapid onset of anxiety and panic as a consequence. In contrast, secondary assessment refers to the evaluation of one's competence to deal with the circumstance. In the instance of taking a driving test, a person's secondary evaluation may be that they are unprepared or insufficient in some manner, leading to failure anxiety. This terror may be longer-lasting and more severe than the fear experienced upon hearing a gunshot. In conclusion, the diverse ways in which individuals experience worry and terror depend on how they evaluate the circumstance. In the instance of the gunshot, the main assessment is that the situation is hazardous and constitutes a threat, whereas the secondary assessment in the case of the driving exam is that the person may not be adequately prepared or qualified to pass the test.
