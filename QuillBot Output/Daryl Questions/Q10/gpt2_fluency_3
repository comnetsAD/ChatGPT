According to Cognitive Assessment Theory (CAT), emotions are the outcome of an individual's perception or appraisal of a circumstance. In the scenario of experiencing immediate worry and panic after hearing a gunshot nearby in a new city late at night, CAT would imply that this emotional reaction is the consequence of an individual's assessment of the circumstance as possibly harmful. This judgment would most likely be influenced by the individual's prior experiences and present situation, such as feeling vulnerable in an unknown and possibly hazardous area. In contrast, experiencing worry and panic for a lengthy period of time before taking a driving test is the outcome of a different assessment of the circumstance. In this circumstance, the person is likely to see the situation as one with the possibility of unfavorable assessment or failure, which would elicit an emotional reaction of dread and fear. This evaluation may be influenced by the individual's previous test-taking experiences and personal ideas about their own driving ability. In summary, the two distinct methods of feeling anxiety and terror derive from differing assessments of the circumstance. The first is a quick reaction to a perceived threat, whereas the second is a prolonged dread of unfavorable judgment or failure. According to the cognitive appraisal hypothesis, distinct emotions come from diverse perceptions or evaluations of a circumstance.
