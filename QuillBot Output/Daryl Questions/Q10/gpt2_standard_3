According to the Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT), a person's interpretation or evaluation of a circumstance is what determines how they feel. CAT would propose that this emotional reaction is the consequence of an individual's assessment of the circumstance as possibly harmful in the example of the immediate sense of worry and terror upon hearing a gunshot nearby in a new city at night. This assessment would probably be influenced by the person's prior experiences and present situation, such as feeling vulnerable in a strange and possibly hazardous setting. However, when a person is preparing to take their driving test, they may suffer prolonged worry and panic as a consequence of how they perceive the scenario. In this instance, the person is probably evaluating the circumstance as one in which there is a chance for failure or a negative assessment, which would be connected to an emotional reaction of worry and dread. This evaluation may be influenced by the person's prior test-taking experiences and personal ideas about their own driving prowess. In conclusion, differing assessments of the circumstance are what lead to the two distinct ways that anxiety and terror are felt. The first is an immediate reaction to an apparent threat, while the second is a protracted time of dread of failure or poor judgment. According to the cognitive appraisal hypothesis, different interpretations or assessments of a circumstance lead to varying emotional responses.
