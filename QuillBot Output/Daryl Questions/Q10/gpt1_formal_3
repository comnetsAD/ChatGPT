Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT) proposes that emotions are the consequence of an individual's evaluation or assessment of a particular event or circumstance. According to CAT, a person's emotional reaction is controlled by two factors: their primary assessment, which determines if a scenario is important or trivial, and their secondary evaluation, which determines whether they have the resources to deal with the circumstance. In the first scenario, a person may sense acute worry and terror while hearing a gunshot in an unfamiliar city at night. This is an example of a high-threat circumstance that would need an initial evaluation of hazard. Due to the unexpected nature of the circumstance, the person may additionally assess that they have limited resources to deal with it, resulting to a secondary evaluation of helplessness. The person may suffer worry and dread as a consequence. In contrast, in the second example, a person who is preparing to take a driving test may feel worry and terror for a lengthy period of time. This is an example of a scenario that is seen as having high importance but low danger. The person may conclude that they have the resources to deal with the issue, but that their performance is crucial and that failure is possible. This results in a secondary evaluation of stress. While a result, the person may feel worry and panic as they anticipate and prepare for the exam over an extended period of time. Cognitive appraisal theory posits that emotional experiences are the outcome of an individual's assessment or appraisal of a particular event or circumstance. In the first case, the emotional reaction is prompted by a primary appraisal of danger and a secondary appraisal of helplessness, but in the second example, the emotional response is caused by a primary appraisal of significance and a subsequent appraisal of stress.
