Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT) states that people's emotions are based on their interpretations. CAT suggests that hearing a gunshot in a new city at night causes anxiety and panic because a person perceives the situation as hazardous. This assessment may be influenced by previous and present circumstances, such as feeling vulnerable in a new and possibly harmful area. Anxiety and worry before a driving test are caused by a distinct perspective. In this circumstance, the person is likely to see the situation as one that might lead to failure or bad assessment, causing worry and panic. This assessment may be influenced by the person's test-taking history and driving ability. In conclusion, various scenario assessments cause worry and terror. The first is a rapid reaction to a perceived threat, while the second is a prolonged dread of failure or criticism. The cognitive appraisal hypothesis states that various perceptions or evaluations of a circumstance cause distinct emotions.
