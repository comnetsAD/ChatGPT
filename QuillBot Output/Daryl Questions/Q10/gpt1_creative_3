According to the Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT), feelings develop when a person makes an assessment of how they feel about a given scenario. The primary appraisal, which determines if a situation is important or unimportant, and the secondary appraisal, which determines whether a person has the resources to deal with the circumstance, are the two main determinants of an individual's emotional reaction, as proposed by CAT. In the first case, someone hearing a gunshot late at night in an unfamiliar place could feel an immediate rush of worry and terror. Such a scenario is indicative of a high level of threat and would warrant an initial evaluation of risk. Due to the unexpected nature of the issue, the person may additionally assess that they lack the resources necessary to deal with it, resulting to a secondary evaluation of helplessness. Because of this, the person may start to feel worried or scared. In contrast, the second scenario demonstrates how a person's worry and terror may build up gradually in the lead-up to a driving test. This is an instance when the level of importance is great while the level of danger is low. Though the person may believe they have the tools necessary to succeed, they nonetheless care deeply about their performance and recognize the danger of falling short. As a result, this causes stress to be evaluated differently afterwards. Because of this, the person may endure stress and worry for quite some time while they anticipate and get ready for the exam. In conclusion, cognitive appraisal theory proposes that emotional experiences are the outcome of an individual's assessment or appraisal of a certain event or scenario, which explains why these two instances of anxiety/fear are experienced so differently. First, the individual's emotional reaction is set off by their primary appraisal of danger and their secondary appraisal of helplessness; second, the individual's emotional response is set off by their primary assessment of relevance and their secondary appraisal of stress.
