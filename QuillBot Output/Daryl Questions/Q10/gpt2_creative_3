According to the Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT), one's feelings are the outcome of how they evaluate a given scenario. Anxiety and panic might come on suddenly in a new city at night when you hear a gunshot close by, and CAT suggests that this is because you've judged the situation to be risky. This assessment would be influenced by the person's history and the circumstances at the time, such as the fact that they are alone in a strange and perhaps hazardous place. When someone feels anxious and afraid for a long time before taking a driving test, however, such feeling is due to a different interpretation of the circumstance. Anxiety and worry would be appropriate responses given that the person in question is probably evaluating the circumstance as one in which they may get a poor rating or perhaps fail. This evaluation may be affected by the person's prior test-taking experiences and their own preconceived notions about their own driving skills. In conclusion, the two forms of dread and anxiety stem from differing interpretations of the same scenario. The first is an immediate reaction to a threat, while the second is a chronic worry about being judged harshly or failing. According to the cognitive appraisal hypothesis, varying degrees of emotional response may be traced back to one's subjective evaluation of a given event.
