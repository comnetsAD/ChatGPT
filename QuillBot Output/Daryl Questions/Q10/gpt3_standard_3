According to the Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT), how a person assesses and interprets a situation affects how they feel. The two sorts of assessments that might cause anxiety and terror, according to CAT, are primary and secondary appraisals. Primary appraisal is the first assessment of a circumstance in terms of how it could affect a person's wellbeing. An individual's first assessment in the instance of hearing a gunshot close in a new city at night is likely to be that the situation is unsafe and endangers their safety. As a consequence, the person may suddenly start to feel anxious and afraid. On the other hand, secondary appraisal describes the assessment of one's capacity to handle the circumstance. When taking a driving exam, a person's secondary evaluation may be that they are unprepared or lacking in some manner, which causes failure dread. Compared to the instant terror felt from hearing a gunshot, this dread may be more pronounced and severe. In conclusion, how a person interprets the circumstance is what causes the many ways that worry and dread manifest themselves. The main assessment in the instance of the gunshot is that the situation is risky and presents a threat, while the secondary assessment in the case of the driving exam is that the applicant may not be enough qualified to pass the test.
