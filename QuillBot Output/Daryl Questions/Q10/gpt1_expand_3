According to the Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT), an individual's feelings are the outcome of their assessment or appraisal of a particular event or circumstance in their environment. According to the CAT, the emotional reaction of a person is governed by two factors: their primary assessment, which determines whether a circumstance is important or trivial, and their secondary evaluation, which determines if they have the resources to deal with the event. In the first scenario, a person could sense instant worry and dread when they hear a gunshot close in an unfamiliar city at night. This scenario takes place in the first example. This is an example of a circumstance that would be seen as high in hazard, and as a result, it would prompt an initial evaluation of the risk that is there. As a result of the unanticipated nature of the event, the person may also come to the conclusion that they have little resources at their disposal with which to deal with it, which may then lead to a secondary evaluation of helplessness. Because of this, the person could end up feeling anxious and scared as a consequence. In contrast, in the second example, a person may feel worry and dread for a prolonged length of time while they are going to take a driving test. This may occur because the test is so important to them. This is an example of a scenario that would be seen as having a high level of relevance but a low level of danger. It's possible that the person will determine that they have the resources necessary to deal with the circumstance, but that they also recognize the significance of their performance and that there is a chance that they will fail. This results in a subsequent evaluation of the stress that was experienced. As a consequence of this, the person could feel worry and dread for a considerable amount of time leading up to the exam as they anticipate and prepare for it. The cognitive appraisal theory proposes that an individual's emotional experiences are the result of the individual's evaluation or appraisal of a particular event or circumstance. According to this theory, the different ways in which anxiety and fear are experienced in these two examples are due to the fact that this theory. In the first scenario, the individual's emotional response is triggered by a primary appraisal of danger and a secondary appraisal of helplessness. In the second scenario, the individual's emotional response is triggered by a primary appraisal of relevance and a secondary appraisal of stress. In both scenarios, the individual's emotional response is a direct result of the primary appraisal.
