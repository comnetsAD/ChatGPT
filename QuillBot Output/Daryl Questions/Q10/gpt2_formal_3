Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT) proposes that an individual's emotions originate from his or her interpretation or evaluation of a circumstance. CAT would argue that the fast onset of worry and panic upon hearing a gunshot in a new place at night is the consequence of an individual's assessment of the circumstance as possibly harmful. This evaluation would likely be influenced by the individual's prior experiences and present circumstances, such as feeling vulnerable in a new and possibly hazardous setting. In contrast, the prolonged sense of worry and terror while a person is preparing to take a driving test is the outcome of a different assessment of the circumstance. In this circumstance, the person is likely to evaluate the situation as one in which negative assessment or failure is possible, which would be connected with an anxious and fearful emotional reaction. This evaluation may be influenced by the individual's prior experiences with taking exams and their own ideas of their driving skills. In conclusion, the two distinct methods of feeling anxiety and terror stem from differing assessments of the circumstance. The first is an instantaneous reaction to a perceived threat, whereas the second is a prolonged time of dread of unfavorable appraisal or failure. According to the cognitive appraisal hypothesis, distinct emotions emerge from diverse interpretations or evaluations of a circumstance.
