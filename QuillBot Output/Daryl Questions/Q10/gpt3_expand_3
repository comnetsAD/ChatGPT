According to the Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT), the way a person analyzes and understands a given circumstance is what determines the emotions that they feel in response to that circumstance. The cognitive analytic theory (CAT) identifies primary and secondary appraisals as the two categories of thoughts that might contribute to the sense of anxiousness and dread in a person. The first assessment of a circumstance in terms of how it could have an effect on an individual's health and happiness is known as the primary appraisal. In the event that a person unexpectedly hears a gunshot close in an unfamiliar city at night, the individual's main assessment of the scenario is likely to be that the situation is hazardous and presents a threat to their safety. As a direct consequence of this, the person can find themselves suddenly overcome with dread and terror. A secondary assessment, on the other hand, is an evaluation of an individual's capacity to deal with the challenge that has been presented to them. When it comes to taking a test to get a driver's license, an individual's secondary evaluation can be that they are not prepared or are lacking in some manner, which would cause them to be afraid of failing the exam. In contrast to the instant terror that one feels upon hearing a gunshot, this dread may last for a longer period of time and be more powerful. In conclusion, the manner in which a person evaluates the circumstance is the primary factor in determining how they will react to feelings of worry and terror. In the instance of the gunshot, the main evaluation is that the situation is hazardous and constitutes a threat. On the other hand, the secondary evaluation in the case of the driving exam is that the person may not be adequately prepared or sufficient enough to pass the test.
