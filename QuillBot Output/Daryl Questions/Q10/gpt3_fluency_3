According to Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT), an individual's emotional experience is defined by how he or she analyzes and understands a scenario. According to CAT, there are two sorts of assessments that might cause anxiety and terror. These are primary and secondary appraisals. The early assessment of a situation in terms of its possible influence on an individual's well-being is referred to as primary appraisal. In the event of hearing a gunshot nearby in a new city late at night, an individual's first assessment is likely to be that the scenario is hazardous and presents a threat to their safety. As a consequence, the person may feel a surge of worry and terror. Secondary appraisal, on the other hand, refers to an assessment of one's capacity to deal with a certain scenario. When taking a driving exam, an individual's secondary evaluation may be that they are unprepared or incompetent in some manner, which leads to dread of failing. This terror may be more lasting and strong than the fear felt upon hearing a gunshot. In conclusion, the various methods of feeling anxiety and terror are attributable to how a person assesses the circumstance. The main assessment in the instance of the gunshot is that the situation is hazardous and constitutes a threat, but the secondary appraisal in the case of the driving exam is that the person may not be prepared or competent enough to pass the test.
