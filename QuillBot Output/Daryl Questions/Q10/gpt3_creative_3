According to the Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT), how one feels depends on their assessment and interpretation of a given event. Primary and secondary appraisals are the two sorts of thoughts that CAT says might cause an anxious or fearful reaction. The phrase "primary assessment" describes one's first impression of a situation and how it could affect them. Hearing a gunshot while walking alone at night in an unfamiliar city would certainly prompt a person to immediately conclude that they are in danger. Therefore, the person may feel a sudden surge of worry and terror. What we mean by "secondary assessment," however, is how we rate our own resiliency in the face of adversity. Individuals may experience anxiety before taking a driving exam because their secondary judgment is that they are unprepared or insufficient. The terror caused by this may last longer and be more severe than the dread caused by hearing a gunshot. In conclusion, how one evaluates a given circumstance determines how one reacts to it emotionally. The main evaluation in the gunshot scenario is the danger and threat posed by the event, whereas the secondary evaluation in the driving test scenario is the possibility that the person is not competent enough to pass the exam.
