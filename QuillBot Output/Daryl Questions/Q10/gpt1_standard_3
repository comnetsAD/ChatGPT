According to the Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT), a person's assessment or appraisal of a particular scenario or incident determines how they feel. A person's emotional reaction, according to CAT, is influenced by two things: their primary assessment, which determines if a scenario is important or unimportant, and their secondary evaluation, which examines whether they have the resources to deal with the issue. In the first case, a person can suddenly feel scared and anxious after hearing a gunshot at night in an unfamiliar city. This is an example of a circumstance that would be deemed high hazard and hence result in an initial assessment of risk. Because the circumstance was unexpected, the person can also judge that they have little resources to deal with it, which might result in a secondary evaluation of helplessness. As a consequence, the person could feel scared and anxious. In contrast, in the second example, a person can go through prolonged periods of worry and panic prior to taking a driving test. This is an example of a scenario that has high importance but low danger. The person may believe they have everything they need to deal with the circumstance, but they also value their performance and recognize that there is a chance of failure. This results in an additional evaluation of stress. While a result, as they anticipate and get ready for the exam, the person may suffer worry and panic for a long time before it. In short, the cognitive appraisal theory postulates that emotional experiences are the outcome of a person's assessment or appraisal of a particular event or scenario, which explains why there are various ways of feeling worry or terror in these two cases. In the first case, a primary appraisal of danger and a secondary appraisal of helplessness lead to the person's emotional reaction, while in the second example, a primary assessment of relevance and a subsequent appraisal of stress lead to the person's emotional response.
