The Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT) proposes that an individual's feelings are the outcome of their interpretation or evaluation of the circumstances around them. CAT would suggest that the sudden experience of anxiety and fear that one has when hearing a gunshot nearby in a strange city at night is the result of an individual's appraisal of the situation as potentially dangerous. This is the case in the case of the sudden experience of anxiety and fear that one has when hearing the gunshot. The person's history and the circumstances of the moment, such as the fact that the individual is feeling vulnerable in a setting that is foreign to them and may present dangers, are likely to have contributed to this evaluation. In contrast, the sense of worry and terror over a prolonged length of time that a person has when they are about to take a driving test is the outcome of a distinct assessment of the circumstance. This may occur while an individual is getting ready to take the exam. In this scenario, the person is most likely assessing the circumstance as one in which there is a possibility for unfavorable appraisal or failure, which would be connected with an emotional reaction of worry and dread on their part. This evaluation may take into consideration the individual's prior experiences with taking exams as well as their own personal ideas of their own driving ability. In a nutshell, the two distinct ways of feeling dread and anxiety are both the product of a unique interpretation of the circumstances around them. The first is an immediate reaction to a threat that has been identified, while the second is a prolonged period of anxiety caused by the prospect of receiving unfavorable feedback or failing an endeavor. According to the cognitive appraisal hypothesis, diverse feelings are the outcome of individuals' unique perceptions or appraisals of the same event.
