Emotions, according to Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT), are the outcome of an individual's assessment or appraisal of a certain event or scenario. An individual's emotional reaction is controlled by two elements, according to CAT: their primary assessment, which examines whether a scenario is meaningful or trivial, and their secondary appraisal, which assesses if they have the resources to deal with the event. In the first case, a person may sense instant worry and dread after hearing a gunshot nearby in an unfamiliar city late at night. This is an example of a circumstance that would be judged high in threat, triggering a primary assessment of hazard. Given the unexpected nature of the circumstance, the person may assess that they have limited resources to deal with it, resulting to a subsequent evaluation of helplessness. As a consequence, the person may feel anxious and fearful. In the second case, a person may suffer worry and panic for a lengthy period of time before taking a driving test. This is an example of a scenario where the relevance is high but the danger is low. The person may believe that they have the resources to deal with the circumstance, but that their performance is essential to them and that failure is possible. This results in a secondary assessment of stress. As a result, the person may feel worry and dread in the days preceding up to the exam as they anticipate and prepare for it. In summary, the differences in how these two individuals perceive anxiety/fear stem from cognitive appraisal theory, which holds that emotional experiences are the outcome of an individual's assessment or appraisal of a certain event or scenario. The individual's emotional reaction in the first case is prompted by a primary appraisal of danger and a secondary appraisal of helplessness, while the individual's emotional response in the second example is caused by a primary assessment of relevance and a secondary appraisal of stress.
