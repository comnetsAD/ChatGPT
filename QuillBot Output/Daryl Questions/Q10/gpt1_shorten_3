Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT) states that emotions come from an individual's judgment or appraisal of a circumstance. According to CAT, an individual's emotional reaction is controlled by two factors: their primary assessment, which determines whether a circumstance is meaningful or trivial, and their secondary evaluation, which determines if they have the resources to deal. When they hear a gunshot in a new city at night, a person may panic. This circumstance would need a major threat assessment. The person may also feel powerless since the issue is unexpected and they have little resources to handle it. Thus, worry and dread may arise. In the second scenario, a person taking a driving test may feel anxious and afraid for a long time. This issue is relevant but low-threat. The person may decide they have the resources to handle the problem, but their performance is essential and there is a chance of failure. Stress is reassessed. As they prepare for the exam, the person may feel worry and dread. In summary, cognitive appraisal theory states that emotional experiences are the outcome of an individual's assessment or appraisal of a certain event or scenario, which explains these two cases' varied anxiety/fear sensations. In the first case, the individual's emotional reaction is prompted by a primary appraisal of danger and a secondary appraisal of helplessness, whereas in the second example, it is driven by relevance and stress.
