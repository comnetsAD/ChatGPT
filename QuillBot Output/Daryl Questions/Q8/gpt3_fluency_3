The study of other species' communication systems may give insight into the development and complexity of human language. There are various animal communication systems that are comparable to human language and others that are unique to humans. The employment of symbols by some bird species, such as parrots, is one example of animal communication that is akin to human language. Parrots have been seen using distinct calls to refer to certain things or acts, similar to how words in human language relate to specific ideas. A parrot, for example, may utilize a distinct call to refer to a certain person or thing in its surroundings. Another instance is the use of syntax and grammar by certain primates, such as chimps. These animals have been seen communicating with one another using a range of vocalizations and gestures, and they employ diverse combinations of these vocalizations and gestures to transmit different meanings. This is comparable to how human language conveys meaning via word and grammatical combinations. However, certain characteristics of human language are unique and cannot be found in other animal communication systems. Human language, for example, may construct an endless number of phrases with an infinite number of meanings. This is referred to as displacement and generativity, and it refers to the capacity to speak about things that are not present in the current time and location, as well as to invent new phrases that have never been stated before. Human language is also employed for problem solving, planning, and self-expression, in addition to communication. Furthermore, human language is unique in its potential for abstract thinking as well as the usage of symbols to express abstract notions such as numbers, quantities, or mathematical procedures. This skill is not found in the communication systems of other animals. Finally, researching the communication systems of other species may help us understand the development and complexities of human language. While some animal communication systems, such as the use of symbols and syntax, are similar to human language, human language is unique in its ability to generate an infinite number of sentences with an infinite number of meanings, as well as its capacity for abstract reasoning and the use of symbols to represent abstract concepts.
