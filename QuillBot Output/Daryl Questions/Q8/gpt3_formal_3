The development and complexity of human language may be better understood by examining the communication systems of other species. Several animal communication systems have parallels with human language, while others are exclusive to humans. Certain bird species, such as parrots, employ symbols as a kind of animal communication that bears parallels with human language. Parrots have been seen using distinct calls to refer to certain things or behaviors, similar to how humans use words to refer to particular ideas. For instance, a parrot may use a particular call to refer to a particular person or thing in its surroundings. The use of syntax and grammar by primates, such as chimpanzees, is another instance. It has been noticed that these creatures utilize a range of vocalizations and gestures to communicate with one another, and they employ diverse combinations of these to transmit different meanings. This is comparable to how human language employs word and grammatical combinations to communicate meaning. However, there are distinctive characteristics of human language not present in animal communication systems. Human language, for instance, is capable of producing an endless number of sentences with an infinite number of meanings. This is referred to as displacement and generativity, which refers to the capacity to discuss topics that are not present in the current time and location and to produce new phrases that have never been said before. Also, human language is used for problem-solving, planning, and self-expression in addition to communication. In addition, human language is unique in its capability for abstract thought and in its ability to utilize symbols to express abstract notions such as numbers, quantities, and mathematical processes. This skill is not apparent in the communication systems of other animals. The study of the communication systems of other animals may provide light on the development and complexity of human language. Human language is unique in its ability to construct an endless number of sentences with an infinite number of meanings, as well as in its capability for abstract thinking and use of symbols to express abstract notions.
