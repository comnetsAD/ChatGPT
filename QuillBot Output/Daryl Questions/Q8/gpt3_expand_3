Researching the ways in which other animals communicate may provide light on the development and complexities of the human language system. There are a few instances of animal communication systems that are comparable to human language, and there are also examples of animal communication systems that are not used by humans. Certain species of birds, such as parrots, employ symbols as a means of communication, which is an example of an animal communication method that is comparable to human language. It has been discovered that parrots use certain calls to refer to particular things or acts, very similar to the way that humans use words to refer to particular ideas in their own language. For instance, a parrot may utilize a particular call in order to refer to a certain person or thing in its surrounding surroundings. Another illustration of this is the usage of grammatical and syntactical structures by some species of primates, such as chimpanzees. It has been noted that these creatures interact with one another using a wide range of vocalizations and gestures, and that they employ a number of different permutations of these vocalizations and gestures to transmit a variety of distinct meanings. This is analogous to the way that the meaning of human language is conveyed by a mix of words and syntax. However, there are characteristics of human language that are exclusive and cannot be found in the communication systems of other animals. These aspects include: For example, the human language has the capacity to produce an unlimited number of phrases, each of which may have an infinite number of different interpretations. This phenomenon is referred to as "displacement and generativity," and it refers to the capacity to speak about things that are not present in the current time and location, as well as the capacity to invent new words that have never been stated before. In addition, human language is used not only for the purpose of communication, but also for the solution of problems, the formulation of plans, and the expression of one's individuality. In addition, human language is one of a kind due to its capability for abstract thinking, as well as its ability to utilize symbols to express abstract ideas such as numbers, quantities, or mathematical processes. Both of these features make human language exceptional. There is no evidence that the communication systems of other animals has this capacity. Researching the ways in which other species communicate might, ultimately, provide light on the development and intricacy of the human language system. Although some animal communication systems are similar to human language in aspects such as the use of symbols and syntax, the capacity of human language to generate an infinite number of sentences with an infinite number of meanings, as well as its capacity for abstract reasoning and the use of symbols to represent abstract ideas, distinguishes it from other forms of animal communication.
