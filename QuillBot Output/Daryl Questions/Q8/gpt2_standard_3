Understanding the development and purpose of language in humans may be gained by researching the communication systems of other species. For instance, substantial research has shown some parallels between human language and the communication systems of bees and parrots. The use of symbols or signs to express certain thoughts or things is one way that bees and parrots' communication is similar to that of humans. Bees, for instance, utilize a "waggle dance" to let other bees in the hive know where food is located. The dance's length and direction act as a symbol, or sign, indicating where the meal is. Similar to this, it has been shown that certain cries made by parrots may alert them to the presence of predators or the need for food. The capacity to combine symbols or signals to transmit more complicated information is another feature that bees and parrots have in common with human language. For instance, by fusing the information sent in the waggle dance with the aroma of the food, bees may communicate the distance and direction of food sources. The usage of various combinations of cries by parrots has also been seen. These calls have been used to communicate information such as the presence of predators or the demand for food. Human language is distinctive in a number of ways, however. The capacity to create an endless number of sentences from a limited amount of words is one of the key distinctions. The "productivity" of human language is referred to as this. This is exclusive to human language since no other species has been shown to be able to combine symbols or signals in order to convey new meaning. The capacity of human language to communicate notions that are metaphorical and abstract, such as feelings, thoughts, and beliefs, makes it distinct from other languages. The use of grammar and syntax is another feature of human language that distinguishes it from other animal communication systems. Human language includes a sophisticated system of laws that regulate the arrangement and combining of words and sentences, allowing us to transmit information in an organized manner and with subtlety. Other animal communication systems don't have anything like this. In conclusion, understanding the development and function of language in humans may be gained through researching the communication systems of other species. While there are some aspects of human language that are shared with other animals, such as the use of signs or symbols and the capacity to combine signs or symbols to convey more complex messages, human language is distinct in its productivity, capacity to convey abstract and metaphorical concepts, and use of grammar and syntax.
