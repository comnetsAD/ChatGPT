Researching the ways in which other animals communicate may provide light on the origins and development of the human language system. For example, research in bees and parrots has brought to light aspects of both their communication systems and human language that are comparable to and different from one another. The use of signs or symbols to stand in for things or ideas is something that is present in the communication systems of other species in addition to being present in human language. For instance, bees have a unique dance language that they utilize to convey to other bees the location of different food sources. The dance, which consists of certain motions and orientations, acts as a signal or indicator indicating the location of food and is performed by some animals. To communicate with one another, parrots employ a wide range of vocalizations and gestures, and some researchers have suggested that these vocalizations and movements may potentially be interpreted as symbols or signs. Combinatorial rules, which permit the mixing of distinct components to produce new meanings, are another feature that human language and the communication systems of other animals share. These rules allow for the creation of new meanings by combining previously existing meanings. For instance, bees will utilize a variety of various dance motions in conjunction with a variety of different orientations in order to communicate information about the proximity and direction of food sources. The formation of words and sentences in human language also involves the combining of a number of distinct sounds or letters. On the other hand, there are a number of significant distinctions between the methods of communication used by other animals and human language. The fact that human language is a symbolic system that is based on arbitrary relationships between signs and meanings is one of the most notable differences. On the other hand, the communication systems of other animals are based on associations that are either innate or learned between specific signs and specific meanings. One more distinction between human language and the communication systems of other animals is that human language is a generative system that permits the creation of an infinite number of new combinations and expressions, whereas the communication systems of other animals are restricted in the number of combinations they are able to create. In a nutshell, research into the ways in which other species communicate might provide light on the origins and development of the human language system. The use of symbols and rules for combinatorial expressions are two aspects that are shared by human language and the communication systems of other animals. On the other hand, there are also noteworthy distinctions, such as the arbitrary link between signs and meanings in human language and the generative character of the language itself.
