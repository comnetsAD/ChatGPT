Studying animal communication methods helps illuminate human language development and function. Bees and parrots have been carefully investigated and shown to have communication systems that resemble human language. Bees and parrots use symbols and signs to communicate. Bees conduct a "waggle dance" to tell their hivemates where food is. The dance's direction and length indicate the food's location. Parrots employ distinct cries to alert predators or request food. Bees and parrots may also use many symbols to communicate. Bees may use the waggle dance and food odor to indicate food source distance and direction. Parrots employ diverse cries to signal predators or food needs. Human language is special, however. One major distinction is the capacity to create endless sentences from a limited collection of words. Language "productivity" is this. Human language alone can combine symbols and signals to generate new meaning. Human language is exceptional in its capacity to express abstract and metaphorical notions like emotions, beliefs, and ideas. Grammar and syntax distinguish humans from other animals. Human language uses sophisticated rules to organize and combine words and sentences to communicate nuanced meaning and structured information. This is unique. In conclusion, examining animal communication systems helps illuminate human language development and function. Human language is unique in its productivity, capacity to transmit abstract and metaphorical notions, and use of grammar and syntax. Other species utilize symbols and signs and can combine them to communicate.
