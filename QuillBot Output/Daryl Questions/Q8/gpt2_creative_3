Understanding the development and purpose of human language may be aided by examining animal communication methods. Bees' and parrots' complex communication systems, for instance, have been dissected for their insights into human language. The use of symbols or signs to express certain ideas or things is a feature shared by human language and the languages of bees and parrots. Bees, for instance, do a "waggle dance" to alert other bees in the hive to the proximity of a food source. How long and in what direction the dance goes might be seen as a signpost pointing to the food's location. Similarly, some cries made by parrots have been identified as warnings of impending danger or requests for food. The capacity to mix symbols or signs to express more complex information is also shared by bees and parrots with human language. With the use of both the waggle dance and the scent of the food, bees may alert their other hives of the location and direction of potential food sources. Similarly, parrots have been shown to employ a variety of call combinations to signal things like the presence of a predator or a need for food. However, there are a number of aspects that make human language different. The capacity to produce an unlimited number of sentences from a finite amount of words is one key distinction. That's what people mean when they talk about the "productivity" of the human tongue. To our knowledge, no other species has ever been recorded mixing symbols or signals in this manner to produce novel meaning, making this skill a hallmark of human language. Moreover, only human language has the capacity to transmit metaphorical and abstract thoughts, feelings, and beliefs. An further feature of human language that distinguishes it from animal communication is the use of grammar and syntax. The ability to express nuanced meaning and organize information is made possible by the complex set of rules guiding the order and arrangement of words and sentences in human language. No other animal communication systems exhibit this feature. In conclusion, learning about how different species talk to one another might provide light on how language developed and is used among humans. Although other species utilize signs and symbols and have the capacity to combine signs and symbols to express more complicated information, human language is distinct in its efficiency, ability to communicate abstract and metaphorical ideas, and use of grammar and syntax.
