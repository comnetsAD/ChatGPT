The study of animal communication systems may provide light on the genesis and development of human language. For example, research on bees and parrots has shown parallels and contrasts between their communication systems and human language. The use of symbols or signs to represent things or ideas is a feature that human language shares with the communication systems of other animals. For example, bees transmit the location of food sources using a dance language. The dance, which comprises of certain motions and orientations, acts as a symbol or indication of the location of food. Similarly, parrots interact with one another using a range of vocalizations and gestures, and some researchers have proposed that these vocalizations and gestures may also be seen as symbols or signs. The use of combinatorial principles, which enable the combining of diverse parts to produce new meanings, is another characteristic shared by human language and the communication systems of other species. For instance, bees communicate information about the distance and direction of food sources using a mix of distinct dance motions and orientations. Similarly, words and sentences in human language are composed of a mixture of distinct sounds or letters. There are, however, a number of significant distinctions between the communication systems of other animals and human language. Human language is a symbolic system based on arbitrary links between signs and meanings, while the communication systems of other species are based on inherent or acquired correlations between particular signals and particular meanings. Human language is a generative system that permits the production of an endless number of new combinations and phrases, but the communication systems of other species are restricted in terms of the number of possible combinations. In conclusion, researching the communication systems of other species may provide light on the emergence and evolution of human language. There are parallels between the communication systems of humans and those of other animals, including the use of symbols and combinatorial principles. Nonetheless, there are important contrasts, such as the arbitrary link between signs and meanings in human language and its generative character.
