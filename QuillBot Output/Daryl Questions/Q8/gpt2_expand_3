Researching the methods by which other animals communicate may provide light on the development and purpose of language in humans. For instance, there have been a lot of studies done on the methods of communication used by bees and parrots, and researchers have discovered that these methods have some parallels with human language. The use of signals or symbols to stand in for certain ideas or things is a feature that both bee and parrot communication have in common with human language. For instance, honeybees will do a "waggle dance" in order to let their fellow workers in the hive know where they might get food. The path that the dance takes and how long it lasts both function as a signal or indication that points in the direction of the meal. In a similar manner, it has been discovered that parrots make certain cries either to warn each other about the existence of potential dangers or to indicate that they are hungry. Bees and parrots, like humans, have the capacity to mix several symbols or signals in order to communicate more nuanced ideas. This is another feature that is shared with human language. By combining the information that is transmitted in the waggle dance with the odor of the food, for instance, bees are able to communicate the location of food sources as well as their distance and direction. In a similar vein, it has been discovered that parrots will employ different combinations of cries in order to communicate various kinds of information, such as the presence of potential threats or the need for food. Nevertheless, human language is exceptional in a number of respects. One of the most significant distinctions is the capacity to produce an unlimited number of phrases by stringing together a limited vocabulary. This property of human language is referred to as its "productivity." This is a capability that can only be found in human language; no other species has ever been discovered to have the capacity to generate new meanings by mixing different symbols or signs in this manner. In addition, the capacity of human language to express metaphorical and intangible thoughts, feelings, and beliefs sets it apart from all other forms of communication. The use of grammatical and syntactical structures is one more element of human language that distinguishes it from the communication systems of other animals. We are able to express nuanced meaning and information in a manner that is organized because to the fact that human language is governed by an intricate set of rules that control the order of words and the combination of words and phrases. There is no evidence of this in the communication systems of any other animals. In conclusion, researching the methods of communication used by other species may provide light on the development and purpose of language in humans. Although some aspects of human language, such as the use of symbols or signs and the ability to combine symbols or signs to convey more complex messages, are shared with other animals, human language is distinct in its productivity, ability to convey abstract and metaphorical concepts, and use of grammar and syntax. Other animals may use symbols or signs and may be able to combine symbols or signs to convey more complex messages.
