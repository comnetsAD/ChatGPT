The study of the communication systems of other animals may provide light on the development and function of human language. For instance, substantial research has shown that the communication systems of bees and parrots have parallels with human language. In common with human language, bees and parrots employ symbols or signs to express certain ideas or things. For instance, bees utilize a "waggle dance" to inform other bees in the hive of the availability of food. The direction and length of the dance act as a signal or indication of the food's location. Similarly, it has been shown that parrots utilize distinct cries to convey the presence of predators or the need for food. The capacity to mix symbols or signals to express more complicated information is another characteristic shared by bees and parrots and human language. For instance, bees may communicate the distance and direction of food sources by combining the information supplied by their waggle dance with the scent of the meal. Similarly, it has been discovered that parrots utilize various combinations of sounds to communicate various sorts of information, such as the presence of predators or the need for food. However, human language is distinctive in a number of ways. The capacity to construct an endless number of sentences from a limited amount of words is one of the major distinctions. This is referred to as the "productivity" of language. No other species has been shown to be capable of creating new meanings by mixing symbols or signals in this manner; this capacity is unique to human language. Moreover, human language is exceptional in its capacity to communicate abstract and metaphorical notions, such as emotions, beliefs, and ideas. The use of grammar and syntax is another element of human language that distinguishes it from other animal communication systems. The complex system of rules guiding the order and arrangement of words and sentences in human language enables us to transmit nuanced meaning and organized information. This feature is unique among animal communication systems. The study of the communication systems of other animals provides insight into the development and function of human language. Some aspects of human language, such as the use of symbols or signs and the ability to combine symbols or signs to convey more complex messages, are shared with other animals. However, human language is unique in its productivity, ability to communicate abstract and metaphorical concepts, and use of grammar and syntax.
