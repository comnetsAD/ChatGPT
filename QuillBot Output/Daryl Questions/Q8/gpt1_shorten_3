Studying animal communication mechanisms may help explain human language evolution. Bees and parrots' communication systems have parallels and contrasts to human language, according to research. Human language and other animal languages employ symbols or signs to represent things or ideas. Bees communicate food sources through dancing. The dance's motions and orientations indicate food's location. Parrots communicate with one other using a range of vocalizations and gestures, which some academics consider symbols or signs. Combinatorial principles enable humans and other creatures to construct new meanings by combining components. Bees communicate food source distance and direction via dancing motions and orientations. Human language employs letters and sounds to form words and phrases. However, animal communication systems vary from human language in important ways. One major distinction is that human language is a symbolic system based on arbitrary connections between signs and meanings, whereas other species' communication systems are based on inherent or acquired correlations between particular signals and specific meanings. Human language is generative, allowing unlimited new combinations and phrases, whereas other creatures' communication methods are constrained. In conclusion, researching animal communication systems helps illuminate human language evolution. Human language and animal communication share symbols and combinatorial rules. Human language's creative nature and arbitrary sign-meaning connection are major contrasts.
