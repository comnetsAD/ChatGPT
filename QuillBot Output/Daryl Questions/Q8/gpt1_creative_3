Learning about how different animals talk to one another might provide light on how our own language developed. Studies of animal communication systems, such as those of bees and parrots, have shown both parallels and contrasts with human language. The use of symbols or signs to represent things or ideas is a feature shared by human language and the communication systems of other animals. In order to share information about food sources with one another, bees have developed a unique dance language. The dance, made up of distinct steps and turns, is used to communicate the proximity of food. Some academics have proposed that the various vocalizations and gestures used by parrots to communicate with one another may potentially be interpreted as symbols or signs. The ability to combine parts to form new meanings is another feature of human language that is shared with the communication systems of other animals. To communicate the location and proximity of food sources, bees adopt a variety of dancing positions and orientations. Words and phrases in human languages are also made up of a variety of sounds or letters put together. There are some fundamental similarities between the languages of other animals and human beings, but there are also significant variances. Unlike the communication systems of other species, which are based on inherent or acquired correlations between particular signals and specific meanings, human language is a symbolic system based on arbitrary relationships between signs and meanings. The communication systems of other species are restricted in the amount of combinations they can make, but human language is a generative system that allows for the production of a limitless number of new combinations and expressions. In conclusion, learning about how other species talk to one another might provide light on how our own language developed. Human language and animal communication systems have several features, such as the use of symbols and combinatorial principles. Differentiating features of human language include its generative character and the arbitrary nature of the interaction between signs and meanings.
