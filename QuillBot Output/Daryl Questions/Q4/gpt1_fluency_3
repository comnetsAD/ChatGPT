Design of Experiment: -Independent Breakfast consumption is a variable that is dependent on Attention during morning lectures is variable. Variable operationalization: -Independent Variable (Breakfast Consumption): -Condition 1: Consuming a standard breakfast (cereal, milk, and fruit) -Condition 2: Failure to eat breakfast (abstinence) -Attention during morning lectures): -Attention will be tested before and after the morning lecture using a standardized attention test (e.g., Digit Span Test, Continuous Performance Test). -Attention will also be assessed based on the number of times students are seen not paying attention during a lecture, as reported by the teacher. In comparison to not having breakfast, eating breakfast leads to improved attentiveness during morning lectures. Participants: A random sample of college students who attend morning lectures. Assign pupils at random to either the breakfast or no breakfast condition. Administer the attentiveness test and note the findings before the morning lesson. The teacher will keep track of how many times pupils are detected not paying attention throughout the lecture. Repeat the attention test after the lecture and note the results. Between the two situations, compare the attention test results and the number of times pupils were caught not paying attention. By comparing attention ratings and the number of times students were caught not paying attention between the two circumstances, this experimental design will assist assess the influence of having breakfast on attentiveness during morning lectures.
