Methodology: -Independent Breakfast-dependent. Morning lecture attention Variable operation: (Breakfast): Condition 1: Breakfasting normally (cereal, milk, and fruit) 2: Skipping breakfast (abstinence) Morning lecture attendance: A Digit Span Test or Continuous Performance Test will evaluate attention before and after the morning lecture. The instructor's report of students' lecture inattention will also assess attention. Hypothesis: Breakfast-eaters pay more attention in morning classes. Participants: Morning college students. Randomize pupils to breakfast or no breakfast. Record the attention test results before the morning lesson. The lecturer will track student inattention throughout the lecture. Repeat the attention test after the talk. Compare attentiveness test scores and pupil inattention rates between situations. By comparing attention ratings and the amount of times students were caught not paying attention, this experimental design will establish how eating breakfast affects morning lectures.
