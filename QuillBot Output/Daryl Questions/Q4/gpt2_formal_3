The impact of breakfast on concentration during morning lectures Whether or whether the student has breakfast before the lecture is an independent variable. Condition 1: The student has breakfast before to class. The student does not have breakfast before to the lecture. Focus throughout the lecture is the dependent variable The amount of distractions that were documented by the student utilizing a distraction log during the lesson. Breakfast consumption before to a presentation will result in less interruptions during the lecture, suggesting improved concentration. Experimental Design: Recruit a representative sample of willing students for the research. Divide the students into two groups, one of which will have breakfast before to the lecture and the other of which will not. Provide each student with a distraction diary and urge them to note any interruptions throughout the lesson. Deliver the same lecture to both student groups on the same day and at the same time. Collect the distraction records of both student groups. Analyze the data by comparing the mean number of distractions for the breakfast-eating group to the mean number of distractions for the breakfast-skipping group. By modifying the independent variable and assessing the dependent variable, this experimental design enables us to examine the influence of breakfast on attentiveness during morning lectures. The random assignment of students to two groups guarantees that any additional elements that may affect their attention during the lecture are divided fairly between the two groups.
