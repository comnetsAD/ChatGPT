A professor may perform an experiment by randomly assigning students to one of two groups: an experimental group and a control group, in order to establish if eating breakfast improves students' attentiveness during morning lectures. In this experiment, the independent variable is whether or not students have breakfast before to the lecture. The experimental group will have breakfast before to the lecture, while the control group will not consume breakfast. In this experiment, the attentiveness of the students throughout the lecture is the dependent variable. Using a standardized attention exam, such as the Digit Span task, which tests the ability to repeat a series of numbers in the proper order, the professor will measure the students' attention. The lecturer will conduct the examination before to and after the lecture. The operationalization of eating breakfast before a lecture is ingesting at least 400 calories within an hour before to the presentation. The experimental group will have a 400-calorie regular breakfast, while the control group will not consume anything before the lecture. The hypothesis for this experiment is that students who have breakfast before to the lecture will be more attentive than students who do not consume breakfast. This experimental design enables the professor to investigate the impact of breakfast on attention while controlling for other variables that may influence attention, like sleep, stress, and time of day. In addition, the lecturer might incorporate other measures to account for characteristics such as sleep and stress, such as monitoring the students' sleep quality and stress levels before the lecture.
