The instructor may choose to run an experiment in which students are randomly assigned to one of two groups: an experimental group and a control group. The purpose of the experiment is to assess whether or not having breakfast enables students to pay better attention to morning lectures. The students' breakfast habits before the lecture serve as the independent variable in this experiment. The dependent variable is the overall performance of the students. The students who are part of the experimental group are going to have breakfast prior to the lecture, but the students who are part of the control group are not going to consume breakfast. The amount of attention paid by the students throughout the instructor's presentation will serve as the dependent variable in this experiment. A standardized attention test, such as the Digit Span task, which tests the ability to repeat a series of numbers in the proper order, will be used by the instructor in order to ascertain the level of attention possessed by the class's participants. The examination will be given by the professor both before and after the presentation. Operationalization: Consuming at least 400 calories within an hour before attending a lecture is operationalized as eating breakfast before attending the presentation. The students who are part of the experimental group will be given a breakfast consisting of a standardized meal containing 400 calories, whereas the students who are part of the control group will not have any breakfast before the lecture. In this experiment, the hypothesis that will be tested is whether or not students who have breakfast before to the lecture will be able to pay closer attention to the material being presented than students who do not consume breakfast. The experimental design enables the professor to evaluate the impact that having breakfast has on attention while controlling for other variables that may influence attention, such as the amount of sleep one gets, the amount of stress one experiences, and the time of day. The instructor might also include extra measurements to control for other variables like sleep and stress, such as determining the students' levels of stress and sleep quality before the lecture. This would be an example of an additional measure that could be included.
