Planning an Experiment: -Independent Dependent Variable: Morning Mealtime Routine Variable: Focus in first-period classes Variable operationalization: Consuming a morning meal is the independent variable in this study. Eating a regular breakfast is the baseline condition (cereal, milk, and fruit) -Secondary Prerequisite: Skipping Breakfast (abstinence) -Relevant Factor (Paying Attention in Class): -Before and after the first morning lecture, participants will take an attentional exam (such as the Digit Span Test or the Continuous Performance Test). Number of times pupils are reported by the teacher as being distracted during class time is another metric for measuring attentiveness. Breakfast eaters are more likely to pay attention in class than those who skip this daily ritual. Methods A subset of college students who regularly attend early-morning classes Students should be placed into the breakfast or no breakfast condition in a random manner. You should give the attentiveness test and take notes on the findings before the first morning class. The number of times pupils are discovered daydreaming or otherwise not paying attention in class will be noted. Re-give the attention test after the talk, and make note of the findings. Examine how well students performed on attention tests and how often they were caught daydreaming under each scenario. By comparing the attention scores and the number of times students were caught not paying attention between the two circumstances, this experimental design will assist assess the influence of having breakfast on attentiveness during morning lectures.
