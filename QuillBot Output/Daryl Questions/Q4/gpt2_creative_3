Hypothesis: Breakfast improves concentration during morning classes Whether or whether a student eats breakfast before class is the independent variable. One prerequisite is that the student have breakfast before the class. Second Prerequisite: The Learner Didn't Eat Breakfast Before Class The number of students who pay close attention during the lecture is the dependent variable. The number of times a student used a distraction journal to keep track of how often they were distracted while listening to the lecturer. The ability to pay closer attention in class is correlated with how well one eats before attending a lecture, so it seems sense that having breakfast before class would improve focus. Methodology based on controlled experiments Selected groups of students were recruited to take part in the research. Put the students into two groups at random: one will have breakfast before the lecture, and the other will not. Distribute a distraction journal to each student and have them keep track of any interruptions they receive while listening to the lecture. On the same day, at the same time, give the identical lecture to both sets of pupils. Student distraction records from both groups should be collected. Data analysis might include comparing the average number of interruptions experienced by the breakfast eaters with those of the non-breakfast eaters. By altering the independent variable and assessing the dependent variable, this experiment can determine whether or not eating breakfast has a positive impact on concentration levels during morning lectures. By splitting the class in half at random, we can make sure that both groups get the same amount of distraction throughout the lecture.
