The lecturer may randomly assign students to experimental and control groups to test if eating breakfast improves morning lecture attendance. This experiment's independent variable is whether students eat breakfast before class. The experimental group will have breakfast before class, whereas the control group will not. This experiment's dependent variable is students' lecture attentiveness. The Digit Span task, which tests the ability to repeat a series of numbers in order, will be used by the lecturer to assess students' attention. The lecturer will test before and after class. Operationalization: Breakfast involves eating at least 400 calories one hour before the lecture. The experimental group will get a 400-calorie breakfast, whereas the control group will not eat before the talk. Hypothesis: Students who eat breakfast before class will pay more attention than those who don't. This experimental design enables the professor to investigate the impact of breakfast on attention while controlling for sleep, stress, and time of day. The lecturer might also monitor students' sleep and stress levels before the lecture to adjust for other influences.
