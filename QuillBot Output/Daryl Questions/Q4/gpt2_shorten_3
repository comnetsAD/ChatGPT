Experiment: Breakfast and morning lecture attentiveness. Independent variable: Breakfast before class. Condition 1: Breakfast before class. Condition 2: No breakfast before class. Attendance during lecture. Operationalized as: Student distraction log entries throughout lecture. Hypothesis: Eating breakfast before the lecture reduces distractions, improving focus. Experimental Design: Find a group of eager pupils. Randomly split students into two groups: one that will have breakfast before the lecture and one that won't. Give them a distraction journal and tell them to note any distractions throughout the lesson. Give both classes the same lecture on the same day. Collect distraction records from both student groups. Compare the mean number of distractions for the breakfast group vs the non-breakfast group. By altering the independent variable and measuring the dependent variable, we may examine how breakfast affects morning lecture attentiveness. The randomization of students into two groups guarantees that other variables that may affect attentiveness during the lecture are equally distributed.
