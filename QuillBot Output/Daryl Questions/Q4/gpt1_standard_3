Research Design: -Independent Variable: Breakfast consumption - Dependent Attention during morning lectures is a variable. Variable operationalization -Independent Variable (Breakfast Consumption): -First condition: Consuming a standard breakfast (cereal, milk, and fruit) -Section 2: Skipping breakfast (abstinence) Attention during morning lectures, dependent variable: Before and after the morning lecture, students' attention will be evaluated using a standardized attention exam (such as the Digit Span Test or Continuous Performance Test). -The frequency with which pupils are seen by the teacher to be disinterested in the lecture will also be used to gauge attentiveness. Theoretically, breakfast eaters pay more attention during morning lectures than those who skip breakfast. Participants: A representative group of college students who attend early lectures Give pupils the option of eating breakfast or not at random. Give the attentiveness test and note the findings before the morning lesson. The professor will keep track of how often pupils are found not paying attention throughout the lecture. Repeat the attention test after the lecture, and note the results. Compare the results of the two conditions' attention tests and the number of instances when pupils were caught not paying attention. By comparing the attention scores and the number of occasions when students were caught not paying attention between the two circumstances, this experimental design will assist assess the impact of having breakfast on attention during morning lectures.
