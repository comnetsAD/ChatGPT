Studying how breakfast affects concentration during morning lectures Whether or whether the student has breakfast before to the lecture is an independent variable. The student eats breakfast before to the lecture (condition 1). Condition 2: The pupil skips breakfast before to the lesson. Attendance during the lecture is a dependent variable. Operationalized as: The amount of interruptions the student noted on a distraction log during the lesson. It is hypothesized that eating breakfast before to the lecture would improve concentration since there will be less distractions. Obtain a sample of students who are receptive to participating in the research using an experimental design. Divide the class at random into two groups: one group that will have breakfast before the lecture and the other group that will not. Give each student a copy of the distraction journal, and ask them to keep track of any interruptions they encounter throughout the lecture. On the same day and at the same time, deliver the identical lecture to both sets of students. Gather the students' distraction diaries from each group. Comparing the average number of distractions experienced by the group who had breakfast with those experienced by the group that had not can help you analyze the data. Through the manipulation of the independent variable and measurement of the dependent variable, this experimental design enables us to investigate the impact of breakfast on attentiveness during morning lectures. The students were randomly divided into two groups, ensuring that any additional elements that may affect attention during the lecture were distributed equally among the two groups.
