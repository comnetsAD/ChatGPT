The professor may perform an experiment to see whether eating breakfast helps students pay attention better in morning lectures by randomly allocating students to one of two groups: an experimental group and a control group. The independent variable in this experiment is whether or not the students have breakfast prior to the lecture. Students in the experimental group will have breakfast before the lecture, whereas students in the control group will not. The pupils' attentiveness throughout the lecture is the dependent variable in this experiment. The lecturer will assess the students' attention by administering a standardized attention exam, such as the Digit Span task, which assesses the ability to correctly repeat a series of numbers. The exam will be given before and after the lecture by the lecturer. Consuming at least 400 calories within one hour of the lecture is operationalized as eating breakfast before the presentation. Students in the experimental group will be given a 400-calorie standardized breakfast, whereas students in the control group will not eat anything before the lecture. The hypothesis for this experiment is that students who eat breakfast before the lecture would pay more attention than students who do not eat breakfast. The professor may evaluate the impact of having breakfast on attention while controlling for other variables that may influence attention, such as sleep, stress, and time of day, using this experimental design. Additional measurements, such as monitoring the students' sleep quality and stress levels before the lecture, might be included by the professor to account for other variables such as sleep and stress.
