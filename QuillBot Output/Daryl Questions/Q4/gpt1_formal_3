Experiment Design: -Independent Variable: Eating breakfast -Dependent Attention during morning talks Implementation of variables: -Independent Variable (Breakfast consumption): -Condition 1: Consuming a conventional breakfast (cereal, milk, and fruit) -Condition No. 2: Skipping breakfast (abstinence) Attention during morning lectures is the dependent variable. -Attention will be tested using a standard attention test (e.g., Digit Span Test, Continuous Performance Test) before to and during the morning lecture. -Attention will also be tested by the number of times pupils are caught by the teacher not paying attention throughout the lecture. Breakfast eaters will be more attentive during morning lectures compared to those who skip breakfast. Participants: a representative sample of college students who attend morning lectures Assign pupils to the breakfast or no breakfast condition at random. Before the morning lecture, conduct and record the attentiveness test. The teacher will record the number of times pupils are detected not paying attention during the lecture. Repeat the attention test after the lecture and note the results. Compare the results on the attention exam with the number of times pupils were caught not paying attention in the two situations. This experimental design will assist assess the influence of breakfast on attentiveness during morning lectures by comparing the attention ratings and the number of times students were caught daydreaming between the two conditions.
