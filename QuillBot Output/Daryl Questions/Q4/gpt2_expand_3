The influence of having breakfast on one's attentiveness during morning lectures was the subject of this experiment. Whether or whether the student has breakfast before the class is a variable that may be controlled independently. Condition 1: The student has breakfast prior to the beginning of the class. Condition 2: The student does not consume any food prior to the beginning of the class. Attendance levels throughout the course of the presentation serve as the dependent variable. The number of times that the student used a distraction journal to keep track of the many things that distracted them while the instructor was speaking. If you have breakfast before the lecture, you will have less distractions during the lecture, which indicates that you will pay more attention to what is being spoken. Design of Experiments: Find a representative group of students that are interested in taking part in the investigation. The students should be split into two groups using a random method: one group should be assigned to have breakfast before the lecture, and the other group should not consume breakfast before the lecture. Give each student a log to keep track of any disruptions they encounter while the instructor is speaking, and give them clear instructions on how to do so. Give the identical lecture to both sets of students on the same day and at the same time, but at different locations. Gather the distraction logs that the two different groups of pupils have created. The results should be analyzed by making a comparison between the mean number of distractions experienced by the group that had breakfast and the mean number of distractions experienced by the group that did not have breakfast. By altering the independent variable, which is breakfast, and measuring the dependent variable, which is attentiveness during morning lectures, this experimental design enables us to investigate the influence that breakfast has on both variables. The students are divided into two groups at random to guarantee that any extraneous elements that may impact attention during the lecture are equally distributed between the two groups. This assures that the students in both groups will pay the same amount of attention to the lecture.
