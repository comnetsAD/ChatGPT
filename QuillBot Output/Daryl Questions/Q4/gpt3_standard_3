The professor may do an experiment by randomly assigning students to one of two groups—an experimental group or a control group—to see whether eating breakfast improves their ability to pay attention in morning lectures. Whether or whether the students have breakfast prior to the lecture serves as the experiment's independent variable. While the students in the control group will skip breakfast, the students in the experimental group will consume breakfast prior to the lecture. The students' attention throughout the lecture served as the experiment's dependent variable. The lecturer will use a standardized attention exam, such as the Digit Span task, to gauge the students' ability to pay attention by having them repeat a series of numbers in the right order. Before and after the lecture, the lecturer will give the exam. Operationalization: Consuming at least 400 calories within an hour before to the lecture is operationalized as eating breakfast. While the students in the control group skip breakfast before the lecture, the students in the experimental group will have a typical breakfast of 400 calories. The idea behind this experiment is to determine if students who eat breakfast before class pay more attention to the lecture than those who don't. With the use of this experimental setup, the professor may examine how eating breakfast affects attention while controlling for other variables like sleep, stress, and the time of day. The lecturer should also take further precautions to account for other variables like stress and sleep deprivation, such assessing the students' stress levels and sleep patterns before to the lecture.
