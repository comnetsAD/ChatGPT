The professor may perform an experiment to find out whether breakfast helps students pay attention in morning lectures by splitting the class into two groups: an experimental group and a control group. Consumption of breakfast before to the lecture serves as the experiment's independent variable. Breakfast will be provided to the pupils in the experimental group, while those in the control group will not. The students' focus throughout the presentation serves as the dependent variable in this study. The class will take an attention exam, such the Digit Span assignment, which evaluates pupils based on how well they can remember and recite a set of numbers. The exam will be given both before and after the lecture by the lecturer. An operationalization of this would be eating 400 calories within an hour before the presentation. While those in the control group will not eat anything before the lecture, those in the experimental group will be given a regular breakfast of 400 calories. The experiment's central premise holds that breakfast eaters will pay more attention in class than their non-breakfast counterparts. The professor may examine the impact of breakfast on focus while also adjusting for any confounding variables like sleep duration, stress levels, and time of day. The lecturer could also take extra measurements, such as assessing the students' sleep quality and stress levels before the lecture, to account for any confounding variables.
