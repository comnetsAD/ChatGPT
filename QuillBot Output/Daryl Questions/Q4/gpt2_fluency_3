Test the impact of breakfast on concentration during morning lectures. The student's breakfast consumption before the lecture is an independent variable. Condition 1: The student has breakfast before to the lecture. Condition 2: Before the lecture, the student does not have breakfast. Attention throughout the lecture is a dependent variable. The amount of distractions throughout the lecture as documented by the student using a distraction log. Theoretical: Eating breakfast before the class will result in less distractions during the presentation, suggesting improved concentration. Recruit a sample of students who are willing to engage in the research for the experimental design. Divide the students into two groups at random: one group that will have breakfast before the lecture, and one group that will not. Distribute a distraction journal to each student and urge them to note any distractions they encounter throughout the lesson. On the same day and at the same time, give the identical lecture to both sets of students. Collect both sets of students' distraction records. Analyze the data by comparing the mean number of distractions for the breakfast group to the mean number of distractions for the non-breakfast group. By altering the independent variable and measuring the dependent variable, we may investigate the influence of breakfast on attentiveness during morning lectures. The randomization of the students into two groups guarantees that any additional variables influencing attention during the lecture are spread equally across the two groups.
