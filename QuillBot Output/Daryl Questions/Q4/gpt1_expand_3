Experiment Design: -Independent Consuming breakfast is a variable that is dependent on. Attention paid throughout classes first thing in the morning Variables are operationalized as follows: -The independent variable, which is whether or not you have breakfast: -Condition 1: Having a breakfast that is usual for you (cereal, milk, and fruit) -Condition 2: Skipping breakfast on a daily basis (abstinence) -The dependent variable (attention paid during morning lectures): Before and after attending the morning lecture, participants will take a standardized attention exam (such as the Digit Span Test or the Continuous Performance Test), which will be used to monitor attention levels. -Another factor that will be included in the calculation of attention is the number of instances in which pupils are seen by the lecturer to be daydreaming or otherwise not paying attention. Eating breakfast, as opposed to skipping it, will result in a marked improvement in one's ability to pay attention during morning classes. Participants: a representative cross-section of the student body of a college or university who regularly attend morning lectures Students should be assigned using a random selection process to either the breakfast or the no breakfast condition. Give the test of attention in the morning before the lecture, and be sure to take notes on the findings. During the course of the lecture, the teacher will keep a tally of the number of times pupils are seen daydreaming or otherwise not paying attention. The attention test should be given once again, and the results should be recorded, after the lecture has ended. When comparing the two situations, compare the students' results on the attention exam as well as the number of times they were busted for not paying attention. This experimental design will assist assess the influence that having breakfast has on attention during morning lectures by comparing the attention scores of students in the two circumstances as well as the number of times that students were caught not paying attention.
