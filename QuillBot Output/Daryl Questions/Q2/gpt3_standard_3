The time and frequency of incentives that are connected to a certain activity are referred to as reward schedules. The possibility of addiction and behavior may be significantly impacted by various incentive schedules. The following are the top three reward schedules: Continuous schedule: With this plan, incentives are given for every time a behavior occurs. A slot machine that pays out every time a player pulls the lever is an illustration of this. Due to the frequent and quick payouts, this reward schedule is perhaps the most addicting. Schedule with intermittent incentives: This kind of schedule distributes awards at random intervals. A casino would serve as an illustration of this, as a player may get the jackpot after only one spin or after numerous. Because the incentives are unexpected and the prospect of receiving them may be very motivating, this kind of reward schedule might be addictive. Ratio schedule: Rewards are given according to a certain ratio of behavior in this kind of reward schedule. A loyalty program where clients get rewards after a set number of purchases is an illustration of this. Due to the fewer frequent rewards, this reward schedule may be less addictive than the other two. Following are two actual instances of companies that benefit from these incentive schedules: Social networking sites like Facebook and Instagram employ a continual schedule of incentives by giving likes and comments on every post, which may lead users to become dependent on monitoring the site and publishing. The irregular schedule of rewards used by online gambling services like PokerStars and Bet365, which provide significant jackpots at sporadic intervals, encourages playing and builds players' hope for enormous wins.
