There are a few distinct kinds of reward schedules, each of which is capable of having an effect on behavior and playing a role in the development of addiction. Continuous reinforcement is a sort of reward schedule in which participants get a reward each time they demonstrate the desired behavior. Because it instills a powerful feeling of anticipation and expectation prior to the delivery of the reward, this schedule has the potential to be the most addictive. The term "variable reinforcement" refers to a kind of reward schedule in which a reward is only given portion of the time when a certain behavior is shown. This timetable is harder to anticipate, which may produce a feeling of anxiety and anticipation, both of which can lead to addiction if not managed properly. Intermittent reinforcement is a kind of reward schedule in which the recipient receives their reward at intervals that are not predetermined. This schedule is also difficult to anticipate, and it may lead to addiction since individuals will continue to participate in the action in the hopes of obtaining the reward, which can cause them to become dependent on the habit. Examples taken from the real world: Continuous reinforcement: Many slot machines employ continuous reinforcement by offering prizes (wins) every time a player pulls the lever. This generates an intense feeling of anticipation and expectation for the reward, which contributes to the game's addictive nature. Intermittent reinforcement: Social media platforms such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok use intermittent reinforcement to keep users coming back by providing occasional rewards, such as likes, comments, or shares on their posts. This technique is used to encourage users to continue using the platform. This results in a feeling of unpredictability and expectation, both of which may pave the way to addiction. In general, reward schedules that are less predictable, such as intermittent and variable reinforcement, might be more addictive than those that are more predictable, such as continuous reinforcement. Intermittent and variable reinforcement are both examples of this.
