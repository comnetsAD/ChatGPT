Addiction is the persistent and compulsive pursuit of pleasurable experiences notwithstanding their unfavorable effects on one's life, or their own or those around them. Patterns of reinforcement, such as reward schedules, may have a significant effect on behavior and can affect the severity of addiction. There are essentially three distinct patterns of incentives, and they are as follows: Rewarding the behavior repeatedly (continuously) is an example of reinforcement. Due to the lack of thrill and anticipation that is characteristic of intermittent reinforcement, this schedule is not thought to be highly addictive. With fixed interval reinforcement, a reward is given at regular intervals of time regardless of how many times a desired behavior has been shown. Because it does not provide the anticipation and thrill of variable interval reinforcement, this schedule is thought to be less addictive. This is called variable interval reinforcement, and it works by rewarding the animal at varying periods of time. Because of the high levels of anticipation and excitement it produces, this schedule is said to be the most addictive. In the real world, variable interval reinforcement is used by several social media sites to maintain user engagement. The unpredictable timing of events like alerts, likes, comments, and new followers heightens the sense of suspense and excitement. Gamers are rewarded at varying intervals on slot machines. Regardless of how much money is in the machine, payouts from slots are random. This raises the stakes, increasing the player's emotional investment and making it more difficult for them to put the game down. The common consensus is that variable interval reinforcement is the most addictive because it builds up a sense of anticipation and excitement that makes it hard for the person to discontinue the habit. Businesses or companies that use incentive systems like social networking and gambling are good examples of those that succeed in keeping consumers coming back.
