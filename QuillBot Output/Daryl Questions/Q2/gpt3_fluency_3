The time and frequency of incentives linked with a certain activity are referred to as reward schedules. Different incentive schedules may have a major influence on behavior and addiction risk. The three most typical reward schedules are as follows: Continuous schedule: A continuous schedule delivers incentives for each incidence of a behavior. A slot machine is an example of this, since the player gets paid every time they pull the lever. Because the benefits are quick and frequent, this form of reward schedule is likely to be the most addictive. Intermittent schedule: This sort of reward plan distributes incentives at random intervals. A casino is an example of this, where a player may win a jackpot on their first spin or after multiple spins. Because the incentives are unexpected, and the anticipation of a reward may be immensely motivating, this form of reward schedule might be addictive. Ratio schedule: A ratio schedule delivers incentives depending on a certain ratio of behavior. A loyalty program in which clients get a reward after a set number of purchases is an example of this. Because the benefits are less frequent, this form of reward schedule may be less addictive than the other two. Two real-world examples of companies that benefit from these incentive plans are: Social media networks such as Facebook and Instagram employ a continual schedule of incentives, such as likes and comments on each post, which may lead to an addiction to monitoring and publishing on the website. Online gambling services such as PokerStars and Bet365 employ an irregular schedule of rewards, delivering massive jackpots at unexpected intervals, creating an addiction to playing and the expectation of winning big.
