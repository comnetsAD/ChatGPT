The time as well as the frequency of the incentives that are connected to a certain action are referred to as reward schedules. Alternate patterns of receiving rewards may have a substantial influence on a person's behavior as well as the risk of developing an addiction. The following are the three reward schedules that are most often used: Continuous schedules are a form of reward plan that provide reinforcement for each and every occurrence of a desired behavior. A good illustration of this would be a slot machine, in which the player receives a prize each time they pull the lever and play the game. Because the rewards come so quickly and often, this particular system of incentives is likely to be the one that leads to the greatest addiction. A incentive system known as an intermittent schedule gives out prizes at sporadic intervals during the duration of the program. A good illustration of this would be a casino, in which a player has the same chance of winning the jackpot after one spin as they have after multiple spins. This kind of reward schedule may be very addictive due to the unpredictability of the rewards and the fact that the prospect of receiving a reward can be a very powerful motivator. One sort of reward schedule is called a ratio schedule, and it consists of providing prizes depending on a certain ratio of behavior. An example of this would be a customer loyalty program, in which consumers are rewarded after reaching a certain threshold of purchases. Because the benefits in this sort of reward schedule come around less often than in the other two, it has the potential to be less addictive. The following are two instances of firms operating in the real world that make use of incentive schedules: It's possible to develop an addiction to monitoring and publishing on social networking sites like Facebook and Instagram since they utilize a continual schedule of incentives, such as delivering likes and comments on every post. Websites that provide online gambling, such as PokerStars and Bet365, utilize a reward system called an intermittent schedule of rewards. This system offers enormous jackpots at unexpected intervals, which encourages players to keep playing in the hope of one day earning a substantial amount of money.
