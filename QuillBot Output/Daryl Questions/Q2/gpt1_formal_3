Behavioral addiction refers to engaging in a certain habit excessively despite its negative repercussions. Different reinforcement schedules or patterns may affect behavior and determine the severity of addiction. There are three main kinds of reward schedules: Continuous reinforcement delivers a reward each time the desired behavior occurs. This schedule is not very addictive since it does not provide the anticipation and thrill associated with intermittent reinforcement. Fixed interval reinforcement offers a reward at predetermined intervals, independent of the quantity of shown behaviors. This schedule is regarded less addictive than variable interval reinforcement since it does not provide the thrill and anticipation associated with intermittent reinforcement. Regardless of the quantity of demonstrated behaviors, variable interval reinforcement offers a reward at random periods of time. This schedule is regarded the most addictive since it builds anticipation and excitement, making it harder for the person to cease the activity. Numerous social media sites utilize variable interval reinforcement to maintain consumer retention. Notifications, likes, comments, and new followers, for instance, arrive at irregular intervals, creating anticipation and excitement. Variable interval reinforcement is used by gambling machines to keep consumers coming back. Slot machines are programmed to pay out at random intervals, independent of the total amount wagered. This generates anticipation and excitement, making it harder for the player to quit playing. In general, variable interval reinforcement is believed to be the most addictive since it generates anticipation and excitement, making it harder for the person to discontinue the activity. Social networking and gambling are examples of industries or products that use this sort of compensation system to retain clients.
