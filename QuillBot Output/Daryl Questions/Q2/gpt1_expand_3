A person is said to be addicted to an activity when they continue to participate in that conduct to an unhealthy degree despite the adverse effects it has on their life. Changing the pattern of reinforcement, often known as the reward schedule, may have a significant effect on behavior and on the degree of addiction. The following are the three primary categories of reward schedules: Continuous reinforcement is a kind of behavioral modification in which a reward is given whenever the desired behavior is demonstrated. Because it does not provide the anticipation and thrill that is associated with intermittent reinforcement, this schedule is not regarded to be highly addictive. A kind of reinforcement known as fixed interval reinforcement involves the delivery of a reward at predetermined intervals of time, regardless of the quantity of behaviors that are shown. Because it does not provide the anticipation and excitement that is associated with intermittent reinforcement, this schedule is thought to be less addictive than variable interval reinforcement. This is due to the fact that it does not generate a variable interval between reinforcements. Variable interval reinforcement is a kind of behavioral reinforcement in which a reward is given at arbitrary intervals of time, independent of the quantity of actions that are shown. It is believed to be the most addictive schedule because it generates anticipation and excitement, which makes it more difficult for the person to refrain from engaging in the habit. Examples from the real world: a number of social media sites make use of variable interval reinforcement to encourage users to continue using their services. For example, alerts, likes, comments, and new followers arrive at unpredictable intervals, which generates both expectation and excitement. Customers are enticed to keep playing gambling machines via the use of variable interval reinforcement. Slot machines are programmed to dispense winnings at predetermined intervals, independent of the total amount of money that has been played through the machine. Because of this, anticipation and excitement are generated, making it more difficult for the person to refrain from playing. Because it generates anticipation and excitement, variable interval reinforcement is often regarded as being the most addictive kind of reward. This is because it makes it more difficult for the person to refrain from engaging in the action. The use of social media and gambling as examples of companies or goods that leverage on this sort of reward schedule in order to entice people to continue purchasing their wares is just one example.
