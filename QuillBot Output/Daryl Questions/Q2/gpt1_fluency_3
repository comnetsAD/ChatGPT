Behavioral addiction is defined as excessive participation in a certain habit notwithstanding the negative effects. Different reward schedules or reinforcement patterns may alter behavior and the amount of addiction. There are three primary kinds of reward schedules: Continuous reinforcement, which involves rewarding the behavior every time it occurs. Because it lacks the suspense and thrill associated with intermittent reinforcement, this schedule is not regarded highly addictive. Fixed interval reinforcement, which offers a reward at predetermined time intervals regardless of the amount of behaviors shown. Because it lacks the anticipation and thrill associated with intermittent reinforcement, this schedule is thought to be less addictive than variable interval reinforcement. Variable interval reinforcement, in which a reward is given at random intervals of time independent of the amount of behaviors shown. This is the most addictive schedule because it builds anticipation and excitement, making it more difficult for the person to cease the activity. Real-world examples: To keep clients coming back, several social media companies utilize variable interval reinforcement. Notifications, likes, comments, and new followers, for example, arrive at irregular intervals, creating anticipation and excitement. To keep consumers coming back, gambling machines employ variable interval reinforcement. Slot machines are programmed to pay out at random intervals, independent of the amount of money spent. This builds excitement and anticipation, making it more difficult for the user to quit playing. Variable interval reinforcement is thought to be the most addictive because it builds anticipation and excitement, making it more difficult for the person to cease the action. Social networking and gambling are two examples of how companies or products use a reward schedule to keep people returning.
