The timing and frequency of incentives for a certain activity are referred to as "reward schedules." The chance of being addicted to a substance may be greatly affected by the timing of rewards. There are generally three types of reward systems in use: With a continuous schedule, incentives are given for each occurrence of the desired behavior. Whenever a player pulls the lever on a slot machine, for instance, he or she receives a prize. Probably the most addicting schedule is one where incentives come quickly and often. Rewards on an intermittent schedule are doled out at sporadic times. In a casino, for instance, a player has just as much chance of winning the jackpot after one spin as they do after numerous. Due to the unpredictability of the rewards and the highly motivating nature of the reward anticipation, this incentive schedule has the potential to become addictive. The awards in a ratio schedule are doled out according to a predetermined ratio of good conduct. A client loyalty program, in which they are rewarded after making a set number of purchases, is one such example. It's possible that this reward schedule is less addictive than the other two since the benefits come less often. Here are two companies in the real world that use incentive programs like this to their advantage: The constant stream of reinforcement that services like Facebook and Instagram provide to users in the form of likes and comments on every post may lead to compulsive behavior such as checking and uploading more often. Some of the most popular online gambling companies, like PokerStars and Bet365, employ an irregular schedule of payouts to keep players coming back for more and increase the excitement of trying to win a significant jackpot.
