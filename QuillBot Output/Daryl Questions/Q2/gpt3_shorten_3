Reward schedules determine when and how often a behavior is rewarded. Reward schedules affect behavior and addiction. Reward schedules include: Continuous schedule: Rewarding every behavior. Slot machines reward players for pulling the lever. Since rewards are quick and frequent, this reward schedule is highly addictive. Intermittent schedule: Rewards are given randomly. A casino player may win a jackpot after one spin or multiple spins. Because the benefits are unexpected and the anticipation is motivating, this reward schedule may be addictive. Ratio schedule: Rewards are based on behavior ratios. A loyalty program that rewards consumers after a set number of purchases is an example. This reward schedule is less addictive than the other two because rewards are less frequent. Two companies that use incentive schedules are: Facebook and Instagram reward every post with likes and comments, which may lead to addiction. PokerStars and Bet365 provide massive prizes at random intervals, creating an addiction to playing and anticipation of winning big.
