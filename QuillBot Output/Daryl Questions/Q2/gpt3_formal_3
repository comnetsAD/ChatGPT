The three most prevalent incentive systems are: This sort of reward plan delivers prizes for each incidence of a desired behavior. An example of this would be a slot machine, in which the player receives rewarded for each lever pull. This form of reward schedule is likely to be the most addictive, since rapid and frequent rewards are provided. This form of incentive plan offers prizes at unpredictably irregular intervals.

By giving high prizes at irregular intervals, online gambling firms like as PokerStars and Bet365 foster an addiction to playing and a sense of anticipation of winning big.
