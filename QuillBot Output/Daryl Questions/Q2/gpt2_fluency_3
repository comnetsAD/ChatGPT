There are various sorts of reward schedules that might affect behavior and addiction, including: Continuous reinforcement: With this sort of reward schedule, a reward is given every time a behavior is shown. This is the most addictive schedule because it develops a strong feeling of expectancy and anticipation for the reward. Variable reinforcement: With this sort of reward schedule, a reward is given just portion of the time a behavior is shown. This timetable is more difficult to anticipate and may rise to feelings of anxiety and anticipation, which can develop to addiction. Intermittent reinforcement: This form of reward plan distributes rewards at random intervals. This schedule is also difficult to foresee and may lead to addiction since individuals will continue to participate in the action in hopes of earning the reward. Examples from the real world: Many slot machines employ continuous reinforcement by offering prizes (wins) every time a player pulls the lever, creating a strong feeling of anticipation and expectancy for the payoff, making it extremely addictive. Intermittent reinforcement is used by social media sites such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok to keep users coming back by delivering infrequent incentives such as likes, comments, or shares on their postings. This generates a sensation of dread and anticipation, which may develop to addiction. In general, less predictable reward schedules, such as intermittent and variable reinforcement, may be more addictive than more predictable schedules, such as continuous reinforcement.
