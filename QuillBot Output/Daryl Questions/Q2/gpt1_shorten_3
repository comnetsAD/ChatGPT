Behavioral addiction is excessive conduct despite unfavorable consequences. Reward schedules affect behavior and addiction. Reward schedules are: Continuous reinforcement, which rewards every behavior. Intermittent reinforcement creates excitement and expectation, making this regimen less addictive. Fixed interval reinforcement, which rewards at defined intervals regardless of behavior. Because it lacks anticipation and excitement, this schedule is less addictive than variable interval reinforcement. Variable interval reinforcement, which rewards randomly independent of behavior. The most addictive schedule fosters expectation and excitement, making it harder to quit. Examples: Many social media sites utilize variable interval reinforcement to retain clients. Notifications, likes, comments, and new followers arrive randomly, creating suspense and excitement. Gambling machines attract clients with variable interval reinforcement. Slot machines give rewards randomly regardless of the amount spent. This builds enthusiasm and makes it harder to quit playing. Variable interval reinforcement is the most addictive because it builds anticipation and excitement, making it harder to quit. Social networking and gambling use this incentive scheme to retain clients.
