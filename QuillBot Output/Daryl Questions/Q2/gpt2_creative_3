The following are examples of reward schedules that have the potential to affect behavior and addiction: A continuous reinforcement program rewards the target behavior at regular intervals. Because of the high level of anticipation and expectation it generates, this schedule is the most likely to be addictive. Reward schedules that are "variable" only give out prizes when certain conditions are met. Due to the increased unpredictability of the schedule, anxiety and compulsive need to keep checking in may develop. In an intermittent reinforcement protocol, rewards are doled out at sporadic intervals. Since of the unpredictability of the timetable, individuals may get addicted to the conduct in question because they will keep at it in the expectation of eventually being rewarded. In the real world: Many slot machines utilize a technique called continuous reinforcement, in which the player gets rewarded (with a win) each time the lever is pulled. This develops a strong feeling of anticipation and expectancy for the payoff, which in turn makes the game very addicting. Social networking sites like as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok employ intermittent reinforcement by sometimes rewarding users with things like likes, comments, and shares on their postings to keep them coming back. It raises anxiety and anticipation, both of which are precursors to addiction. Intermittent and variable reinforcement plans, like these, may be more addictive than continuous reinforcement schedules because they are less predictable.
