Several reward schedules may affect behavior and addiction: Continuous reinforcement rewards every behavior. This routine is most addicting because it builds anticipation for the payoff. Variable reinforcement: This reward schedule rewards behavior sometimes. This timetable might cause anxiety and addiction due to its unpredictability. Intermittent reinforcement: Rewards are given randomly. This schedule is unpredictable and might lead to addiction since individuals would keep doing the activity to get the reward. Examples: Continuous reinforcement: Many slot machines provide prizes (wins) every time a player pulls the lever, creating a strong sensation of anticipation and expectancy for the payoff, making it extremely addictive. Intermittent reinforcement: Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok employ incentives like likes, comments, and shares to keep users coming back. This leads to anxiety and addiction. Intermittent and varied rewards are more addictive than continuous reinforcement.
