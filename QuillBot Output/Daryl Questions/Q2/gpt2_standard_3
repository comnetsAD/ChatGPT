The following are a few examples of the many reward schedules that might affect behavior and have an effect on addiction: Continuous reinforcement: With this kind of reward schedule, the behavior is rewarded each time it is shown. Because it fosters a strong feeling of expectancy and anticipation for the reward, this schedule is perhaps the most addictive. Variable reinforcement: With this kind of scheduling, rewards are given only sometimes when a behavior is shown. This timetable may lead to anxiety and expectation, which can breed addiction since it is harder to anticipate. Reinforcement that occurs only sometimes is known as intermittent reinforcement. Additionally unpredictable, this schedule might cause addiction as individuals will keep acting in the way they are in the hopes of getting the reward. Examples from real life Continuous reinforcement: Many slot machines employ continuous reinforcement by awarding prizes (wins) each time a player pulls the lever. This fosters a strong feeling of expectancy for the prize and makes the game very addictive. By giving users sporadic incentives like likes, comments, or shares on their postings, social media sites like Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok employ intermittent reinforcement to keep users coming back. As a result, there is a sensation of dread and anticipation that may develop into addiction. In general, less predictable reward schedules, such intermittent and variable reinforcement, may make people more addicted than more predictable schedules, like continuous reinforcement.
