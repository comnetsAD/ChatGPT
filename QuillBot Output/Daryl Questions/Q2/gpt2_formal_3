There are several forms of reward schedules that might affect behavior and addiction, including: This form of reinforcement plan delivers a reward each time a desired behavior is displayed. This schedule is likely to be the most addictive since it generates an intense sensation of anticipation and eagerness for the reward. Variable reinforcement: This sort of reinforcement schedule delivers a reward for a behavior only on occasion. This timetable is less predictable and might produce a feeling of anticipation and uncertainty, which can develop to addiction. Intermittent reinforcement is a reward schedule in which rewards are administered at unexpected intervals. This unpredictable schedule may develop to addiction, as individuals will continue to participate in the action in hopes of earning the reward. Real-world illustrations: Continuous reinforcement: Many slot machines employ continuous reinforcement by offering prizes (wins) each time a player pulls the lever. This develops a strong feeling of anticipation and expectancy for the reward, which makes the game very addictive. Social media networks such as Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok employ intermittent reinforcement to keep users coming back by delivering infrequent incentives, such as likes, comments, and shares on their postings. This produces anxiety and expectation, which may develop to addiction. In general, less predictable reinforcement schedules, such as intermittent and variable reinforcement, may be more addictive than more predictable reinforcement schedules, such as continuous reinforcement.
