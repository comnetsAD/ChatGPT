The excessive practice of a certain activity despite the consequences is referred to as behavioral addiction. Different reinforcement schedules or patterns may affect behavior and the degree of addiction. There are three primary categories of reward schedules: Continuous reinforcement is the practice of rewarding the behavior repeatedly. Because this schedule lacks the thrill and anticipation that intermittent reinforcement brings, it is not thought to be highly addictive. Regardless of the quantity of actions shown, fixed interval reinforcement rewards activity at predetermined periods of time. Because it lacks the thrill and anticipation that intermittent reinforcement provides, this schedule is thought to be less addictive than variable interval reinforcement. Regardless of how many behaviors are shown, variable interval reinforcement rewards behavior by giving rewards at unpredictable intervals of time. Because it fosters anticipation and excitement, this schedule is regarded as the most addictive because it makes it more difficult for the person to cease the activity. Examples from the real world: To retain users on their social media platforms, several of them utilize variable interval reinforcement. For instance, the random occurrence of alerts, likes, comments, and new followers builds excitement and expectation. To keep players coming back, gaming machines employ variable interval reinforcement. No matter how much money is put into a slot machine, it will still pay out at random intervals. This increases the sense of suspense and excitement, which makes it harder for the player to stop. Variable interval reinforcement is often seen to be the most addictive since it fosters excitement and anticipation, making it harder for the person to cease the habit. Examples of organizations or products that make use of this kind of incentive system to keep consumers coming back include social networking and gambling.
