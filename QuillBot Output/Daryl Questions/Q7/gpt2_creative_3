Human mind is profoundly influenced by the language we use to express ourselves since language allows us to interact with others and share our ideas and perspectives. The way we communicate with one another has a significant impact on how we interpret the environment and how we categorize our own experiences. Language has been found to influence how we think about and talk about things like time, color, numbers, and social classes. The Whorf-Sapir hypothesis, also known as the linguistic relativity theory, is an example of a line of inquiry that shows how language influences human mind. According to this theory, the way a language is put together affects how its speakers see and understand the world. One's perspective and comprehension of the world are shaped by the language one uses to do so. For instance, Lera Boroditsky and coworkers discovered that people who speak various languages had distinct conceptions of time. Results indicated that those who speak languages like English and Spanish, which have clear grammatical markers for the past, present, and future, have a linear conception of time, whereas those who speak languages like Kuuk Thaayorre, which lack such markers, have a more cyclical conception of time. Boroditsky and coworkers also discovered that people of various linguistic groups conceptualize color in various ways. According to the research, those who speak languages with a greater number of color names, like English, have a more nuanced and specific awareness of color than people who use languages with fewer color terms, like Dani. These studies show that the language we use may affect our concepts of time and color, and that the structure of a language can change the way its speakers view and think about the environment. In conclusion, language is crucial in molding human mind since it allows us to share our ideas and perspectives with others. It has also been proven that our conceptions of time and color may be impacted by the language we use, and that the structure of a language can shape the way we experience and think about the environment.
