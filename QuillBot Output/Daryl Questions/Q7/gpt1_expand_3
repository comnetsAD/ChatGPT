Language is an extremely important factor in the formation of human cognition. It not only changes the way we think about and comprehend the world, but it also gives us the ability to express our thoughts, emotions, and experiences to other people. Research has shown that the language that we use may have an effect on not just our perception and memory but also our ability to make choices. The study of linguistic relativity, also known as the Whorfian hypothesis, is an example of research that exemplifies the role that language plays in molding mind. [Citation needed] This theory proposes that the language we choose to communicate influences both the way we think and the way we see the world around us. The research that Eleanor Rosch and her colleagues did in the 1970s on how people see color is one of the most well-known studies that backs up this theory. They discovered that people who speak English, which only has words for 11 primary colors, have a more difficult time distinguishing between blue and green hues that are very similar to one another than people who speak some indigenous languages, which have words for a much wider range of gradations of each color. This lends credence to the idea that the language we use may influence both the way we see colors and the way we think about them. In summary, several studies have shown that language plays an important part in the formation of human mind. The language that we speak impacts the way that we take in information, the way that we think, and the way that we comprehend the world. An example of how the language that we use may influence the way that we think can be found in the research on linguistic relativity, and more specifically in the research on color perception that Eleanor Rosch conducted.
