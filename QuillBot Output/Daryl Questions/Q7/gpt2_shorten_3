Language shapes human mind by allowing us to communicate. Language organizes our ideas and worldview. Language affects our sense of time, color, quantity, and social categories, according to research. The Whorf-Sapir hypothesis (linguistic relativity theory) shows how language shapes human cognition. This idea suggests that linguistic structure affects how speakers see the world. Language shapes our worldview. Lera Boroditsky and colleagues discovered that various languages have distinct time ideas. The research found that speakers of languages with grammatical markers for past, present, and future, like English and Spanish, conceive of time linearly, whereas speakers of languages without these markers, like Kuuk Thaayorre, think of time cyclically. Boroditsky and colleagues discovered that various languages had distinct color notions. English speakers have a more thorough and fine-grained perception of color than Dani speakers, according to the research. These studies show that linguistic structure affects how speakers see the environment and how they think about time and color. Finally, language shapes human mind by allowing us to communicate. Research also shows that linguistic structure affects how we see and think about the environment, time, and color.
