Language is essential to the formation of human thinking. It enables us to convey our thoughts, emotions, and experiences to others, and it changes the way we see and comprehend the world. The language we use may alter our perception, memory, and even our decision-making, according to research. The study of linguistic relativity, often known as the Whorfian hypothesis, is an example of research that demonstrates the influence of language on mind. This idea proposes that the language we use influences our thought processes and worldview. Eleanor Rosch and her colleagues' color perception research from the 1970s is a well-known study that supports this notion. They discovered that English speakers, who have words for 11 fundamental colors, had a more difficult time differentiating between identical tints of blue and green than speakers of some indigenous languages, who have terms for a great deal more of these hues. This indicates that language may influence how we view and think about colors. Research has shown, in conclusion, that language plays a key role in moulding human mind. The language we speak influences how we view, reason, and comprehend the world. The study of linguistic relativity, and in particular Eleanor Rosch's research of color vision, illustrates how language influences our mental process.
