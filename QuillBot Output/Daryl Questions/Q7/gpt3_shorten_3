Language helps people express their ideas and experiences, developing human thinking. It helps individuals think, classify, infer, and reason. Cognitive psychology has revealed that language and mind are interconnected and that language shapes our worldview. Lera Boroditsky's work on linguistic relativity suggests that language changes our cognition and worldview. According to Boroditsky, language patterns affect how speakers conceive about time, place, and causality. In one research, she discovered that speakers of English, which has a linear sense of time, think of time as a line that runs forward, whereas speakers of Aymara, a South American indigenous language, thought of time as repeating cycles. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis shows how language shapes cognition. According to Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf, a language's structure affects its speakers' worldview. They claimed that language categories and differences impact how individuals classify and think about the world. In certain languages, blue and green are the same hue, making speakers less likely to distinguish them. Language allows people to express and share their ideas and experiences, changing human thinking. It may impact how we organize the world and think about time, space, causality, and other notions. Language and mind are interwoven, and how we use language affects how we see and interpret the world.
