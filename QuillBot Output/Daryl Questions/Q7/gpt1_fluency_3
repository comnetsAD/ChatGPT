Language is critical in influencing human cognition. It enables us to share our thoughts, emotions, and experiences with others, and it also impacts how we think about and comprehend the world. According to research, the language we use has an impact on our perception, memory, and even decision-making. The study of linguistic relativity, often known as the Whorfian hypothesis, is one example of research that demonstrates the function of language in creating mind. According to this theory, the language we use influences how we think and view the world. Eleanor Rosch and her colleagues' color perception research from the 1970s is one renowned study that supports this theory. They discovered that English speakers, who have words for 11 fundamental hues, had a harder difficulty differentiating between comparable shades of blue and green than indigenous language speakers, who have terms for many more shades of same colors. This implies that the language we use may influence how we see and think about colors. Finally, research has proven that language plays an important role in moulding human mind. The language we use impacts how we view, think about, and comprehend the world. The research of linguistic relativity, particularly Eleanor Rosch's investigation of color vision, exemplifies how the language we use impacts our mental process.
