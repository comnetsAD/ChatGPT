For people to be able to describe and convey their ideas and experiences, language plays a fundamental role in forming human mind. It's what makes it possible for humans to think systematically, classify data, draw conclusions, and reason about the world. Study after study in cognitive psychology has shown the inextricable connection between language and mind and the power of language to mold our worldviews. As an example, consider the work of Lera Boroditsky on linguistic relativity, the theory that the language we use affects our thoughts and perceptions. Boroditsky discovered that the grammatical features of a language influence how its speakers conceptualize time, place, and causality. The speakers of Aymara, an indigenous language of South America, have a cyclical understanding of time, while the speakers of English, which has a linear concept of time, conceive of time as a line that runs ahead. The Sapir-Whorf hypothesis is another line of inquiry that shows how language influences human cognition. Edward Sapir and Benjamin Lee Whorf put out a notion that the way a language is structured affects the way its speakers see and understand the world. They maintained that a language's speakers' conceptualizations of the universe are shaped by the linguistic differences and categories that exist inside that language. Some languages, for instance, do not discriminate between the hues blue and green, and speakers of such languages are less likely to be able to tell the difference between the two. Language, as a way of representing and communicating ideas and experiences, has been proven to have a significant role in the development of human mind. It may affect our ability to classify and make sense of the universe, as well as our conceptions of time, space, and causality. Because of the inextricable connection between language and mind, the words we choose to express ourselves may have a major influence on our ability to make sense of the world.
