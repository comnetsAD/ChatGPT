Language molds human cognition. It helps us express ourselves and develops our worldview. Language affects perception, memory, and decision-making, according to research. Linguistic relativity, or the Whorfian theory, shows how language shapes mind. This idea implies that language impacts our thoughts and worldview. Eleanor Rosch's 1970s color perception research confirms this. They observed that English speakers, who have words for 11 basic hues, had a harder difficulty differentiating comparable shades of blue and green than speakers of other indigenous languages, who have terms for many more shades. This implies that language affects color perception. Finally, language shapes human mind. Language impacts our worldview. Linguistic relativity, and Eleanor Rosch's color perception research, show how language affects cognition.
