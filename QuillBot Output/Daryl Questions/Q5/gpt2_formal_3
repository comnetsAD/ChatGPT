On the basis of Sara's dialogue, it is conceivable that she suffers from a psychiatric problem. The symptoms she mentions, such as severe anxiety, avoidance of social settings, difficulties sleeping, impatience, and problems focusing, are consistent with the diagnostic criteria for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD is a mental condition characterized by intrusive, undesired, and uncontrolled intrusive and repetitive thoughts, emotions, ideas, sensations, and actions. Sara may satisfy the following three criteria for a diagnosis of OCD: Sara expressed having constant and acute concerns about contamination and the worry of contracting COVID-19 from fast food. These anxieties meet the requirements for obsessions, which are recurring, persistent, and unwelcome thoughts, urges, or pictures that generate worry or discomfort. Sara expressed avoiding social interactions with friends and relatives, as well as shopping and exercising. This avoidance behavior meets the requirements for compulsions, which are described as repeated behavioral or mental activities that a person feels compelled to execute in response to an obsession or in strict adherence to rules. Sara's trouble sleeping, impatience, and inability to concentrate might be seen as a kind of impairment in social, occupational, and other crucial areas of functioning. Notably, a professional examination by a mental health expert is required to confirm a diagnosis of OCD and to rule out other potential diagnoses, such as generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and major depressive disorder.
