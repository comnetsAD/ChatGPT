Sara may be dealing with a psychological condition based on the talk we had with her. Intense anxiety, avoiding social settings, trouble sleeping, impatience, difficulty focusing, and excessive concern about contamination are among the symptoms she lists that are compatible with the criteria for an obsessive-compulsive disorder diagnosis (OCD). A mental illness called OCD is defined by recurrent, persistent, and intrusive thoughts, emotions, ideas, sensations, or actions that are uncontrolled, undesired, and invasive. Sara may satisfy the following three requirements for an OCD diagnosis: Obsessions: Sara spoke about her deep and ongoing concerns with contamination and her worry of contracting COVID-19 from fast food. These concerns fit the description of obsessions, which are characterized as recurring, persistent, and unwelcome thoughts, urges, or pictures that elevate worry or discomfort. Compulsions: Sara spoke of her need to avoid going out to see friends or family, going shopping, or exercising. This avoidance behavior meets the requirements for compulsions, which are described as compulsive actions or repeated behaviors that a person feels compelled to carry out as a result of an obsession or in accordance with tightly enforced norms. Sara described having trouble falling asleep, becoming angry, and having trouble focusing, which may also be seen as a kind of impairment in social, occupational, or other crucial areas of functioning. It is important to remember that a mental health professional's assessment is required to confirm an OCD diagnosis and to rule out other diagnoses such generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, or major depressive disorder.
