Sara's speech suggests a psychiatric condition. She exhibits obsessive-compulsive disorder symptoms include severe anxiety, avoidance of social settings, problems sleeping, impatience, difficulty focusing, and excessive contamination fear (OCD). OCD involves intrusive, unwelcome, and uncontrolled thoughts, emotions, ideas, sensations, or actions. Sara may fit three OCD criteria: Obsessions: Sara was obsessed with fast food contamination and COVID-19. Obsessions are recurring, unwelcome, and distressing thoughts, urges, or pictures. Compulsions: Sara avoided socializing, shopping, and exercising. Compulsions are repeated actions or mental acts that a person feels forced to execute in response to an obsession or strict regulations, like this avoidance behavior. Impairment: Sara had difficulties sleeping, impatience, and concentration, which might affect social, vocational, or other key functions. A mental health practitioner must diagnose OCD and rule out other disorders such generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, and major depressive disorder.
