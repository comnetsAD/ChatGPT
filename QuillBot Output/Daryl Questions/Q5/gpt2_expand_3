In light of everything we discussed, it is not out of the question to assume that Sara is dealing with some kind of mental illness. The symptoms that she mentions, such as severe anxiety, avoiding social settings, having problems sleeping, impatience, difficulty focusing, and excessive concern about contamination, are consistent with the criteria for a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) (OCD). An obsessive-compulsive disorder, often known as OCD, is a mental condition that is defined by persistent and repeating thoughts, emotions, ideas, sensations, or actions that are reported as being intrusive, undesired, and uncontrolled. OCD may be diagnosed in Sara if she satisfies all three of the following criteria: Obsessions: Sara stated having acute and persistent worry about contamination and the dread of getting COVID-19 from fast food. She also mentioned having a fear of catching COVID-18 from other people. Obsessions are characterized by recurring, persistent, and undesirable thoughts, urges, or visions that are the source of concern or suffering. These anxieties fit the requirements for an obsession, which is described as recurrent, persistent, and unwanted. Compulsions: Sara expressed avoiding going out to meet friends or family, avoiding going shopping, and avoiding exercising in order to escape her compulsions. Compulsions are defined as repetitive behaviors or mental acts that a person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied rigidly. This avoidance behavior is consistent with the criteria for compulsions, which are defined as repetitive behaviors or mental acts that a person feels driven to perform in response to an obsession. Impairment: Sara reported having trouble sleeping, being irritable, and having trouble focusing, all of which might be seen as forms of impairment in social functioning, occupational functioning, or other essential areas of functioning. A professional evaluation by a mental health professional is required to confirm a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), as well as to rule out other possibilities, such as generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, or major depressive disorder. It is important to keep in mind that this is the case because it is the only way to confirm a diagnosis of OCD.
