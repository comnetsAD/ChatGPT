Sara may be afflicted with a psychiatric condition, especially an Anxiety Disorder, based on the facts supplied. Anxiety disorders are a collection of mental health diseases defined by excessive and persistent concern and terror in response to commonplace events. Here are three supporting criteria for this diagnosis: Sara recounts having extreme and constant fear and concern, especially in relation to the COVID-19 epidemic. Due to her nervousness, she also avoids certain circumstances and activities, such as leaving the home, going shopping, and meeting friends. Sara's difficulties sleeping, impatience, and inability to concentrate when working from home may be suggestive of an anxiety disorder's impact on her everyday functioning. These symptoms have a detrimental effect on her everyday functioning. Specific Phobia: Sara also shares a worry that the fast food she is consuming may be sick since the packaging has not been sterilized. This may indicate Specific Phobia, which is defined by an extreme and persistent dread of a particular item or scenario. Importantly, a certified mental health professional should perform a full examination and apply diagnostic criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) or the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) to make an accurate diagnosis (ICD). As soon as possible, Sara must seek expert assistance to get a thorough diagnosis and treatment.
