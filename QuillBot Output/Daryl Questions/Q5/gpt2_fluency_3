According to our chat with Sara, she may be suffering from a psychiatric problem. The symptoms she mentions, such as severe anxiety, avoidance of social settings, problems sleeping, irritability, difficulty focusing, and excessive concern about contamination, are consistent with obsessive-compulsive disorder characteristics (OCD). OCD is a mental condition characterized by persistent and repeated intrusive, unwelcome, and uncontrolled thoughts, emotions, ideas, sensations, or actions. Sara may fulfill three requirements for an OCD diagnosis: Obsessions: Sara acknowledged having significant and recurring concerns about contamination and the possibility of contracting COVID-19 through fast food. These concerns fit the definition of obsessions, which are recurring, persistent, and unwelcome thoughts, urges, or pictures that generate worry or discomfort. Sara expressed avoiding going out to meet friends or family, as well as avoiding going shopping or exercising. This avoidance behavior fits the definition of compulsions, which are described as repeated behavioral or mental activities that a person feels compelled to execute in response to an obsession or according to rigorous rules. Impairment: Sara reported sleeping difficulties, impatience, and trouble focusing, all of which might be interpreted as impairment in social, occupational, or other critical aspects of functioning. It is important to note that a professional examination by a mental health expert is required to confirm an OCD diagnosis and to rule out alternative possibilities, such as generalized anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, or major depressive disorder.
