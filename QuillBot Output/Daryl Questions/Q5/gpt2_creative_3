Sara may have a mental illness based on our talk. Intense anxiety, social phobia, insomnia, irritability, poor concentration, and an excessive preoccupation with germs are all symptoms associated with a diagnosis of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Involuntary, undesired, and uncontrolled thoughts, emotions, ideas, sensations, or actions are hallmarks of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Sara may fulfill the following three criteria for an OCD diagnosis: Sara has detailed her obsessive, unrelenting worry of contracting COVID-19 from eating at fast food restaurants due to contamination. Obsessions are characterized by recurring, persistent, and unwelcome thoughts, urges, or pictures that generate concern or suffering, therefore these fears fit the bill. As a result of her compulsions, Sara avoided going to the store and exercising, among other things she had previously enjoyed doing. Compulsions are described as "repetitive actions or mental activities that a person feels forced to execute in response to an obsession or according to rules that must be applied strictly," thus this pattern of avoiding situations fits the bill. Impairment: Sara reported problems sleeping, being irritable, and having trouble focusing, all of which might be interpreted as a type of impairment in social, occupational, or other critical areas of functioning. It is important to note that a mental health professional assessment is required for both confirming a diagnosis of OCD and ruling out other possibilities, such as GAD, agoraphobia, and major depressive disorder.
