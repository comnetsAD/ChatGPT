On the basis of the available facts, it is conceivable that Sara suffers from a psychiatric problem. The symptoms she reports, which include excessive anxiety, avoidance of activities and locations, problems sleeping, irritability, difficulty focusing, and infection-related anxiety, are consistent with the diagnostic criteria for Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD). GAD is a condition characterized by excessive and unmanageable anxiety over a wide range of events or activities. To satisfy the diagnostic criteria for GAD, a person must display at least three of the following symptoms: Unease or a sense of being tense or on edge Being quickly exhausted Difficulty focusing or a blank state of mind Irritability Muscle tension Sleep disturbance In the instance of Sara, she recalls feeling irritated, tense, or on edge, as well as having trouble sleeping and focusing. In addition, her avoidance of activities and locations and her fears of infection meet the criteria for GAD. It is crucial to highlight that a competent mental health practitioner should do a comprehensive examination before diagnosing GAD or any other disease. In addition, it is important to note that the COVID-19 pandemic has a significant influence on people's mental health, therefore it is reasonable to assume that Sara's symptoms were amplified by the pandemic.
