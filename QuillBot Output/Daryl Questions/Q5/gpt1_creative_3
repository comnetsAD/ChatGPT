As far as we can tell from the available data, Sara may be struggling with a mental health issue; more specifically, an Anxiety Disorder. There is a spectrum of mental health diseases known as anxiety disorders, and they are all marked by excessive and persistent concern and terror over ordinary things. The following three indicators strongly suggest this diagnosis: Sara says she has had extreme and ongoing anxiety, most recently with the COVID-19 epidemic. She says that she has stopped going out, shopping, and seeing friends and relatives because she is too anxious to deal with these circumstances. Sara is having trouble sleeping, is often irritated, and has trouble focusing when working from home, all of which are negative symptoms that may point to an anxiety problem. She is having difficulty managing her everyday life as a result of these symptoms. Sara also reveals a more particular phobia: she's worried the fast food she's eating could make her sick since the paper it comes in hasn't been sterilized. Intense and unrelenting dread of a single item or scenario is a hallmark of Specific Phobia, which may be indicated. A licensed mental health professional is the only one qualified to make a diagnosis. They will perform a thorough evaluation and may use diagnostic criteria from either the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) or the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) (ICD). Sara should consult a doctor immediately to receive an accurate diagnosis and treatment.
