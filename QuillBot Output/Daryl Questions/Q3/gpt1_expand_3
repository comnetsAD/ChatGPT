The size of the picture that is projected onto the retina, in addition to the distance between the observer and the object, are the two primary factors that define how an object is seen by an observer. Your description of the glasses indicates that they alter the perceived distance of an item, but they do not alter the size of the picture that is formed on the retina. Because of this, the brain would interpret the distance between itself and the object to be greater than it really is. This occurs as a result of the fact that the size of an item as it appears on an observer's retina reduces as the distance between the object and the observer increases. In this scenario, the glasses would make things seem smaller even if their actual dimensions would not change. Objects that are farther away seem to be closer, while those that are closer appear to be further away. It might also create changes in the way the brain receives and interprets the visual information, which would make it difficult to gauge distances and make it more difficult to carry out activities that require depth perception, such as driving or playing sports.
