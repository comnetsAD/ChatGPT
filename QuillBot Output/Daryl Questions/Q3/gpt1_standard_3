The size of the picture that is projected onto the retina and the item's distance from the observer both affect how an object is seen. The glasses you mentioned alter an object's distance without altering the size of the retinal picture. As a result, the item would seem to be further away than it really is in the brain. Wearing glasses might alter how you see things because they make items look smaller, for example. This is due to the fact that an object's size on the retina shrinks as its distance from the viewer rises. In this instance, even if the items are the same size physically, the glasses would make them look smaller. Wearing the glasses might alter perception in another manner by altering how deep a picture is perceived to be. A closer thing would look further away, whereas a faraway object would appear closer. The spectator could get confused and disoriented as a result. Additionally, it could alter how the brain receives and interprets visual data, making it more challenging to evaluate distances and more challenging to engage in activities like driving or playing sports that require depth perception. Considering that the brain utilizes information about object distances to retain and recall information about the environment, it is important to note that these glasses may also have an effect on other cognitive processes including memory and spatial awareness.
