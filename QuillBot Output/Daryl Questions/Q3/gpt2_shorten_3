The brain perceives sensory information. The faculty's glasses, which trick the brain into seeing things further away without altering their appearance on the retina, may impair depth perception. These glasses make the brain think things are further away. This perceptual alteration may influence how the brain understands object size, position, and distance. A close item may seem smaller and farther away. A faraway item may seem bigger and closer. The glasses may also alter brain processing of relative motion and motion parallax. Motion parallax occurs when the observer's viewpoint shifts. The glasses diminish relative motion and adjust scene speed by making nearer things look further away. The glasses may also influence how the brain understands scene size and position. The brain calculates object distances using size and position. However, the glasses might induce confusion and disorientation by making nearer items look further away. The glasses may alter the brain's sensory processing, altering object distance, size, and placement.
