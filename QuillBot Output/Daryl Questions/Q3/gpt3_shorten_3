The brain perceives sensory information. The faculty's glasses, which trick the brain into seeing things further away without altering their appearance on the retina, may impair depth perception. These glasses make the brain think things are further away. The glasses may also alter brain processing of relative motion and motion parallax. The glasses diminish relative motion and adjust scene speed by making nearer things look further away. The glasses may also influence how the brain understands scene size and position. The brain calculates object distances using size and position. The glasses may alter the brain's sensory processing, altering object distance, size, and placement.
