The retinal image size and object distance influence how an item is seen. Your glasses modify object distance without increasing retinal image size. The brain would see the thing as further away than it is. The glasses may make items look smaller. The retinal size of an item diminishes with distance from the viewer. The glasses would shrink items even if they're the same size. The eyewear might also alter visual depth perception. Distances would look closer and closer distances further away. The observer may get disoriented. It might also impact how the brain receives and interprets visual information, making it tougher to gauge distances and conduct depth-perception tasks like driving or sports. Since the brain utilizes object distance to store and recall environmental information, these glasses may also affect memory and spatial awareness.
