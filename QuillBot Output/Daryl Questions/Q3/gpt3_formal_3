Perception is the brain's process of interpreting and making meaning of sensory data. The design of the faculty's glasses, which deceive the brain into believing things are farther away than they really are without altering how they look on the retina, is likely to impact depth perception. The brain will perceive items as being further away than they really are while these glasses are worn. This alteration in perception is likely to influence how the brain calculates the size, position, and distance of things. When seeing a close item, for instance, it may seem smaller and farther away. Similarly, a faraway item may seem bigger and closer when seen from a distance. Moreover, the glasses may influence how the brain interprets relative motion and motion parallax. Motion parallax is the shift in the relative location of items in a scene caused by a change in the observer's point of view. When the glasses make adjacent items look farther away, this reduces relative velocity and alters the apparent speed of objects in the picture. In addition, the glasses may influence how the brain interprets the relative size and position of things in a scene. The brain determines the relative distance between items based on the size and placement of the objects. The mismatch between the size and placement of items and their perceived distance might lead to confusion and disorientation if the glasses make adjacent objects look farther distant. The glasses are likely to interfere with the brain's normal processing of sensory information, resulting in altered perceptions of the distance, size, and position of things.
