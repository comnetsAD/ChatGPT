The perception of an item is governed by the size of the picture projected onto the retina and the observer's distance from the object. The glasses you mentioned alter the object's distance without altering the size of the picture on the retina. This would lead the brain to incorrectly assess the object's distance. One manner in which this might alter vision when wearing the glasses is by making things look smaller. This is because, as the distance between an item and the observer increases, the object appears smaller on the retina. In this example, the glasses would make physically identical things look smaller than they are. Another way this might alter perception when wearing the glasses is if the depth of an image is interpreted differently. Objects that are farther away would look closer, while those that are closer would appear further away. This might confuse and disorient the spectator. Changes in the way the brain receives and interprets visual information might also occur, making it difficult to assess distances and performing tasks that require depth perception, such as driving or playing sports, more difficult. It is important to note that these glasses may also have an effect on memory and spatial awareness, since the brain utilizes information about the distance of objects to store and recall information about the surrounding environment.
