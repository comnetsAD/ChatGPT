The process through which the brain interprets and makes sense of the information that it receives from the senses is called perception. The design of the faculty's glasses, which are intended to trick the brain into believing that things are farther away than they really are without modifying how the items look on the retina, is likely to have an effect on depth perception. When you wear these glasses, your brain will perceive the distance between you and an item to be greater than it really is. Because of this shift in perception, it is probable that the brain will interpret the size, position, and distance of things differently as a result. When one looks at a close thing, for instance, the object could seem smaller and far away than it really is. When seen in the same way, an item that is farther away may seem bigger and nearer when viewed up close. In addition, it is possible that the glasses will have an effect on the way in which the brain perceives relative motion and motion parallax. The shift in the relative location of items in a scene that occurs when the observer moves their position in relation to the scene is known as motion parallax. As a result of the glasses' ability to make adjacent things look farther away, the amount of relative motion in the scene will appear to be altered, as will the apparent speed of the various elements within it. In addition, it's possible that the glasses change the way in which the brain analyzes the relative size of items and where they are located in a scene. The size of an item and its position are taken into account by the brain when calculating the distance between two other things. The glasses' ability to make adjacent items look farther away, on the other hand, would result in a mismatch between the size and placement of objects and their perceived distance. This might result in confusion and disorientation. Overall, it is anticipated that the glasses will interfere with the normal processing of sensory information by the brain, which will result in a change in perception of the distance between objects, as well as their size and placement.
