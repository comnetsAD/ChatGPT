The process through which the brain interprets and makes meaning of sensory data is known as perception. Depth perception may be impacted by the faculty's creation of spectacles that trick the brain into believing that things are further away than they really are without altering how they look on the retina. The brain will see items as being further away than they really are while wearing these glasses. This shift in perception is probably going to have an impact on how the brain calculates an object's size, position, and distance. For instance, a close item may seem smaller and farther away when seen from a distance. Similar to this, an item may seem bigger and closer when seen from a distance. Additionally, the glasses could influence how the brain interprets motion parallax and relative motion. The relative location of items in a scene varies when the observer's point of view shifts, and this phenomenon is known as motion parallax. The amount of relative motion would be reduced and the apparent speed of things in the image would shift as the glasses make nearer items look further away. Additionally, the glasses could influence how the brain interprets a scene's items' relative sizes and locations. The brain calculates the relative distance between items based on the size and placement of the objects. A mismatch between the size and placement of items and their perceived distance, however, might create confusion and disorientation if the glasses make adjacent objects look further away. Overall, the glasses are likely to interfere with the brain's regular processing of sensory information, changing how close, big, and where items seem to be.
