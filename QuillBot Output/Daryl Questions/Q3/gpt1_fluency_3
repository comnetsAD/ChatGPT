The size of the picture projected onto the retina, as well as the distance of the item from the observer, influence the perception of an object. The glasses you mentioned adjust the distance between an item and the retina without affecting the size of the picture on the retina. As a result, the brain perceives the thing as being farther away than it is. One way the glasses may alter vision when wearing them is that they would make items look smaller. This is due to the fact that when the distance between an item and the observer grows, so does the size of the object on the retina. In this situation, the glasses would make items look smaller despite the fact that they are the same size. Another way the glasses might alter perception when wearing them is that they alter the apparent depth of a picture. Items farther away look closer, whereas objects closest to the camera appear further away. The observer may get confused and disoriented as a result of this. It may also alter how the brain receives and interprets visual information, making it difficult to gauge distances and execute tasks that require depth perception, such as driving or playing sports. It's worth mentioning that these glasses may have an effect on other cognitive functions like as memory and spatial awareness, since the brain utilizes distance information to store and recall information about the surroundings.
