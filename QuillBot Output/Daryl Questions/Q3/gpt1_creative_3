The size of the picture projected onto the retina and the distance of the item from the observer are the two most important factors in establishing how an object is seen. You've described spectacles that alter one's perception of distance without affecting the size of an object's picture on the retina. As a result, the brain would interpret the distance to the item as being greater than it really is. Wearing these glasses may alter one's perspective by making everything look smaller than they really are. This is because the size of an item on the retina reduces with increasing distance from the observer. The glasses would make everything seem smaller, even if it's the same size as before. The glasses may also alter how depth is perceived in a scene while being worn. Distances would be reversed, with nearby things seeming farther away and distant things appearing closer. The spectator could get bewildered and disoriented as a result of this. In addition, it may alter the way a person's brain receives and interprets visual information, making it more challenging to gauge distances and engage in activities like driving or playing sports that rely on this skill. Keep in mind that the brain utilizes distance information to store and recall information about the surroundings, thus these glasses might potentially affect other cognitive functions like memory and spatial awareness.
