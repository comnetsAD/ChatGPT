The brain's interpretation and understanding of sensory data is called perception. Faculty members have developed glasses that trick the brain into seeing things as farther away than they really are, without altering the visual image that reaches the retina. As a result of wearing these spectacles, the brain will process distance perceptions as being greater than they really are. As a result of this shift in perspective, the brain may recalculate how big things are, where they are, and how far away they are. A close item, for instance, may seem smaller and farther away than it really is. Similarly, if you stare at something far away, it could seem bigger and closer than it really is. The glasses may also alter the way in which one's brain interprets motion parallax and relative motion. Objects in a scene undergo motion parallax, which is defined as a shift in their relative positions when the viewpoint of the viewer shifts. Reduced relative velocity and altered perceived speed of items in the scene would result from the glasses' ability to make nearer objects look farther distant. On top of that, the glasses may alter the way your brain interprets the size and placement of items in a scene. The brain utilizes an object's size and its position to calculate its distance from another. The glasses' ability to make adjacent items look further away, however, might lead to a disorienting discrepancy between the size and position of objects and their perceived distance. The glasses will likely alter one's impression of distance, size, and position by interfering with the brain's regular processing of sensory information.
