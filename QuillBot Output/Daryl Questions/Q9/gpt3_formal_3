Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT) claims that an individual's emotions are the outcome of his or her cognitive assessment or appraisal of a given event. According to this theory, a person's emotional reaction to a certain event is governed by the individual's cognitive evaluation of the situation, especially in terms of the situation's importance to their well-being and the resources they have to deal with the problem. In the instance of rage, a person may feel this feeling when they view a situation to be dangerous or unfair, and they believe they have the power to alter it. The Critical Appraisal Theory (CAT) posits that two sorts of evaluations might rise to the emotion of rage. The assessment of a situation in terms of its significance to an individual's well-being is referred to as primary appraisal. For instance, rage is triggered when a person views a situation as a danger or a challenge to their aspirations. The second sort of review is known as secondary evaluation, and it entails evaluating the available resources to deal with the problem. If a person believes they have the capacity to alter or influence a certain circumstance, they may feel wrath. However, if a person believes they have no control over a situation, they may experience emotions of helplessness and dissatisfaction. Consider that John is going to work when he gets cut off by another motorist. He regards the scenario as a danger to his safety and his ability to get on time for work. This initiates his first evaluation of the circumstance. His secondary appraisal is activated when he examines his coping options and concludes that he could blast his horn and alert the other motorist to let them know he is unhappy with their actions. Overall, the Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT) suggests that rage is the outcome of a person's cognitive evaluation of a circumstance as significant to their well-being and as something they can modify or control. As a reaction to the perceived danger or challenge, this might stimulate the feeling of rage.
