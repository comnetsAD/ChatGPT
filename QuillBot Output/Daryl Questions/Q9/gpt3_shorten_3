According to Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT), emotions are caused by cognitive evaluations of situations. This theory states that a person's emotional reaction to a circumstance is based on their cognitive evaluation of the issue's importance to their well-being and their resources to deal with it. Anger occurs when a person believes they can alter a frightening or unfair circumstance. CAT suggests two assessments may cause rage. Primary assessment assesses a situation's impact on an individual's well-being. Anger is triggered when someone regards a situation as a threat to their aspirations. Secondary assessment evaluates resources to handle the problem. Anger might result from a person believing they can control the circumstance. If a person feels powerless, they may get frustrated. John gets shut off on his way to work. He worries about his safety and getting to work on time. This triggers his first assessment. He then examines his coping options and decides to blow his horn to let the other vehicle know he is unhappy with their actions, activating his secondary evaluation. CAT suggests that a person's cognitive appraisal of a situation as significant to their well-being and as something they can modify or control causes anger. The imagined danger or challenge might cause rage.
