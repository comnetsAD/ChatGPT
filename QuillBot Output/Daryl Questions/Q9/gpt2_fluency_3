Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT) is a theory that describes how emotions are created in response to how an event or circumstance is interpreted. People's emotional reactions, according to CAT, are dependent on their cognitive assessment of the event or circumstance. When it comes to feeling anger, CAT explains that it may occur when a person perceives a danger or unfairness. The process starts when a person perceives an incident or scenario as a possible danger or injustice to their well-being or aspirations. They next undertake a cognitive assessment of the event or circumstance, determining if it is beneficial or detrimental, and whether it is related to their aims or worries. If the person believes the incident or scenario to be damaging or undesirable and it is related to their aims or worries, they will feel angry. The person will then react to the incident or circumstance with an aggressive or assertive behavior. For example, if a person is passed up for a promotion that they feel they deserve, they may see this as a danger to their professional ambitions. They may next undertake a cognitive assessment of the incident, determining if it is damaging or relevant to their aims. As a consequence, they will be irritated and may reply assertively by speaking to their management to convey their displeasure. In summary, CAT argues that a person may get angry when they detect a danger or injustice, make a cognitive appraisal of the event as damaging and relevant to their aims or worries, and react with an aggressive or forceful behavioral propensity.
