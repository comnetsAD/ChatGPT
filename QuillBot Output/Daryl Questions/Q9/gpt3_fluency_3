According to Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT), emotions are the consequence of an individual's cognitive assessment or appraisal of a certain scenario. According to this theory, a person's emotional reaction to a certain event is governed by the individual's cognitive assessment of the situation, especially in terms of the issue's importance to their well-being and the resources available to deal with the problem. In the instance of rage, a person may feel it when they see a situation to be frightening or unfair, and they believe they can do something to alter it. According to CAT, there are two sorts of assessments that might result in the emotion of rage. The first form is known as primary appraisal, and it entails assessing a situation in terms of its importance to the individual's well-being. For example, if a person considers a scenario as a danger or a challenge to their aspirations, the feeling of rage will be activated. The second sort of assessment is known as secondary appraisal, and it entails assessing the resources available to deal with the problem. Anger may be experienced when a person believes they have the capacity to modify or control the situation. However, if a person believes they have no influence over the issue, they may feel powerless and frustrated. As an example, suppose John is going to work and gets cut off by another car. He views the scenario as a danger to his safety and his aim of being on time at work. This stimulates his first assessment of the scenario. He next assesses his coping skills, and he feels he could blow his horn and alert the other vehicle to express his displeasure with their actions, which triggers his secondary evaluation. Overall, CAT posits that rage is the outcome of a person's cognitive assessment of a circumstance as significant to their well-being and as something they can modify or control. As a reaction to the perceived danger or challenge, this might elicit the feeling of rage.
