Emotions, according to the Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT), arise from an individual's mental assessment of the circumstance. An individual's emotional reaction to a given event is the result of careful consideration of the situation's significance to their own well-being and the availability of coping mechanisms, as proposed by this theory. Anger may arise when someone feels powerless in the face of a scary or unfair circumstance but nevertheless believes that they can make a difference. According to the Cognitive Activation Theory (CAT), there are two distinct sorts of evaluations that might cause rage. Primary assessment is the first category and entails determining whether or not a given event has a direct bearing on one's own well-being. A person may feel rage, for instance, if they see a given circumstance as a danger to or an obstacle to the attainment of their objectives. Evaluation of the means by which to deal with the problem is the second sort of assessment, known as a "secondary appraisal." Anger might develop when a person believes they have no control over a certain scenario. However, emotions of helplessness and irritation might set in if a person believes they have no say in the matter. Let's say John is going to the office and on his way there, he is cut off by another car. To him, this seems like a major obstacle to his getting to work on time and to his personal safety. The trigger for his first evaluation of the issue has been pressed. His secondary assessment kicks in as he considers his options for dealing with the situation, and he concludes that he can blast his horn to let the other vehicle know he is unhappy with his actions. A person's cognitive evaluation of a circumstance as important to their well-being and as something that they can modify or control is central to CAT's overall proposal that rage is the product of such an appraisal. As a defense mechanism against the perceived danger or challenge, rage may be triggered in this way.
