The Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT) is a proposition that suggests that an individual's feelings are the outcome of their cognitive assessment or appraisal of a certain circumstance. The individual's cognitive appraisal of the situation, particularly in terms of the situation's relevance to their well-being and the resources they have available to them to cope with the situation, is what determines a person's emotional response to a particular situation, according to this theory. This theory was developed by psychologists and psychiatrists. When it comes to anger, a person may feel this feeling when they view a situation as being dangerous or unfair, and they also have the notion that they can do something to alter the situation. This combination may cause a person to feel angry. The CAT postulates that there are two distinct ways of appraising a situation that might ultimately result in the feeling of anger. The first kind of assessment is called a primary appraisal, and it refers to the process of analyzing a scenario in terms of how relevant it is to an individual's health and happiness. Anger will be triggered in a person, for instance, when they see a circumstance as posing a risk to their objectives or an obstacle to their progress toward achieving those objectives. The second kind of assessment is termed a secondary appraisal, and it entails assessing the many resources that are at one's disposal in order to deal with the circumstance. Anger is a common emotion that may result from a person's mistaken belief that they have the power to influence or control the circumstances around them. On the other hand, if a someone believes that they have no influence over the circumstances, they may experience emotions of helplessness and frustration as a result. Take, for example, the scenario in which John is traveling to work when he is suddenly cut off by another motorist. He views the circumstance as something that may compromise both his well-being and his ability to go to work on time. This prompts him to begin the fundamental evaluation of the circumstance. His secondary appraisal is activated as a result of his evaluation of his coping resources, and he comes to the conclusion that he may be able to signal the other motorist by beeping his horn and letting him know that he is unhappy with the way that they are behaving. In general, the CAT postulates that the experience of anger is the result of a person's cognitive appraisal of a situation as relevant to their well-being and as something that they have the ability to change or control. In other words, anger is caused when a person believes that they can influence or change the outcome of a situation. As a reaction to the perceived danger or difficulty, this might stimulate the feeling of rage as a protective mechanism.
