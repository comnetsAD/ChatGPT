A theory called the Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT) describes how emotions are produced in response to how we understand an event or scenario. People's emotional reactions, according to CAT, are dependent on how they perceive the event or circumstance cognitively. CAT says that when it comes to anger, a person may start to feel this feeling when they see a danger or an injustice. The process starts when a person notices something that they judge to be a danger to their aims or an injustice to their well-being. After then, they assess the circumstance or occurrence cognitively to determine if it is beneficial or detrimental and whether it is relevant to their objectives or worries. Anger will then be felt by the person if they believe the circumstance or incident to be detrimental or undesirable and it is pertinent to their objectives or worries. The person will then react to the circumstance or occurrence with a predisposition toward action, such as hostility or assertiveness. For instance, if someone gets passed over for a promotion they felt they earned, they can see this as a danger to their professional aspirations. Then they could assess the situation cognitively, judging it to be detrimental and pertinent to their objectives. As a consequence, they get enraged and may react assertively by speaking to their management in order to voice their displeasure. In conclusion, CAT proposes that a person may feel anger when they detect a danger or injustice, make a cognitive evaluation of the event as damaging and relevant to their aims or worries, and react by acting in a way that is aggressive or forceful.
