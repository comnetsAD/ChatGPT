Emotions, according to Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT), are caused by one's evaluation of a given event or circumstance. Emotional reactions, according to CAT, originate from an individual's mental evaluation of the relevant circumstances. Anger, according to CAT, may develop when a person feels threatened or wronged. The first step is for a person to become aware of anything they believe poses a risk to their safety or is unjust in some way. They next do a mental evaluation of the scenario, deciding whether or not it poses a threat and whether or not it has any bearing on their priorities. If the person feels threatened, and the event or circumstance is important to their aims or worries, they may get angry. Action tendencies like aggressiveness or assertiveness may then emerge as a result of the incident or circumstance. For instance, one's sense of professional security may be shaken if they are overlooked for a promotion they felt they earned. They may then engage in a cognitive evaluation of the occurrence, determining that it is detrimental to and important to their objectives. This will make them feel angry, and they may react by being more direct with their management about how they feel about the situation. In conclusion, the cognitive-affective theory (CAT) suggests that anger develops when a person perceives a threat or injustice, forms an evaluation of the event as harmful and relevant to their goals or concerns, and then exhibits an action tendency, such as aggression or assertiveness, in response to the event.
