The Cognitive Appraisal Theory, sometimes known as CAT, is a theory that attempts to explain how various feelings may be experienced by a person depending on how they cognitively evaluate a certain circumstance or occurrence. The cognitive appraisal theory (CAT) proposes that an individual's feelings are the outcome of their evaluations of the importance or personal relevance of a certain event or circumstance. CAT theorizes that a person's perception of a circumstance as one in which their objectives or desires are being hindered or impeded in some manner is what sets off the anger response in that individual. When a person views their circumstances as being unfair, unjust, or as being a danger to their own personal well-being, they may find themselves experiencing rage. Take for instance a person who is travelling on the highway when they are abruptly cut off by another vehicle, prompting them to have to slam on their brakes. Anger is a feeling that will most likely come over the individual if they consider the circumstance to be one in which they are in danger to themselves personally. Their interpretation of the event as dangerous sets off the brain's fight-or-flight response, which in turn causes the body to secrete stress hormones and experience emotions of rage. In addition, the individual can judge the circumstance to be unfair on the grounds that the acts of the other driver are self-centered and lack consideration for the safety of the other motorists on the road. This evaluation of injustice stimulates a separate brain network, which in turn leads to a feeling of moral indignation and further strengthens the sensation of fury. In a nutshell, the CAT postulates that a person's perception of a circumstance as one in which their aims or desires are being hindered or impeded in some manner is what sets off the emotion of anger in that individual. The threat response in the brain is activated when a person believes that they are being treated unfairly or that the circumstance poses a harm to their own personal well-being. This in turn leads to emotions of rage.
