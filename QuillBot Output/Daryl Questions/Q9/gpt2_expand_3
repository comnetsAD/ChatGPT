The Cognitive Appraisal Theory, sometimes known as CAT, is a theory that attempts to explain how feelings are formed in response to an individual's appraisal of a particular event or circumstance. The cognitive appraisal theory (CAT) asserts that an individual's emotional reactions are determined by how well they understand the event or circumstance they are experiencing. When it comes to feeling anger, the Cognitive Activation Theory (CAT) proposes that a person may come to experience this emotion when they see a danger or unfairness in their environment. The first step in the process is for a person to become aware of an occurrence or circumstance that they assess as posing a risk or an injustice to their well-being or the accomplishment of their objectives. The next step in the process is for them to conduct an intellectual analysis of the occurrence or circumstance in question, during which they consider if it is detrimental or detrimental, as well as whether it is relevant to their aims or worries. Anger will be experienced by the person if they believe the occurrence or circumstance to be detrimental or detrimental to them, and if it is related to their aims or worries. After then, the person will react to the occurrence or circumstance by displaying an action propensity, like aggressiveness or assertiveness, for example. For instance, if a person feels that they should have been given a promotion but are not, they may see this occurrence as a challenge to their ability to achieve their desired professional outcomes. The next step in the process is for them to do a mental analysis of the occurrence and determine whether or not it is detrimental to their objectives. As a consequence of this, they will feel rage and as a result of this, they may react with assertiveness by having a conversation with their management to voice their displeasure. In conclusion, the Cognitive Activation Theory (CAT) proposes that a person may come to experience anger when they perceive a threat or injustice, make a cognitive appraisal of the event as harmful and relevant to their goals or concerns, and then respond with an action tendency such as aggression or assertiveness.
