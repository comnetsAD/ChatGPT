Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT) is a theory that describes how people feel various emotions depending on their cognitive judgments of a certain scenario or occurrence. Emotions are the consequence of an individual's evaluations of the importance or personal relevance of a given event or circumstance, according to CAT. CAT believes that anger is sparked when a person perceives a situation as one in which his or her objectives or desires are being hindered or impeded. When a person perceives a situation to be unfair, unjust, or a danger to their own safety, they may sense wrath. Consider a person travelling on the highway who is abruptly cut off by another vehicle, leading them to stop sharply. If a person views a situation to be a danger to his or her safety, rage is likely to ensue. Their perception of the scenario as threatening stimulates the brain's threat response, resulting in the release of stress hormones and emotions of wrath. In addition, the individual may see the situation as unjust since the acts of the other motorist are selfish and inconsiderate of other cars on the road. This evaluation of injustice stimulates a distinct brain network, elicits a sense of moral indignation, and exacerbates wrath. In summary, CAT posits that anger is created when a person perceives a situation as one in which his or her objectives or desires are being frustrated or obstructed. The individual's perception that the circumstance poses a danger to their own safety or is unjust stimulates the brain's threat response, resulting in anger.
