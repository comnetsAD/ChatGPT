Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT) is a theory that describes how emotions result from the perception of an event or circumstance. According to cognitive appraisal theory, people's emotional reactions are determined by their cognitive evaluation of an event or scenario. When it comes to rage, CAT argues that a person may feel this feeling when they see a danger or injustice. An person perceives an occurrence or circumstance that they see as a possible danger or injustice to their well-being or objectives. Then, they do a cognitive evaluation of the occurrence or circumstance, determining if it is hurtful or detrimental and whether it is relevant to their aims or worries. The person will feel rage if they believe the incident or scenario to be damaging or undesirable and it is related to their aims or worries. The person will react to the incident or circumstance with an action propensity, such as anger or assertiveness. For instance, if a person gets passed over for a promotion they felt they earned, they may interpret this as a danger to their professional objectives. They may then do a cognitive evaluation of the occurrence and determine that it is detrimental and relevant to their objectives. As a consequence, they will feel rage and may react assertively by communicating their discontent with their management. In conclusion, CAT implies that a person may feel anger if they see a danger or injustice, evaluate the event as damaging and relevant to their aims or worries, and react with an action inclination like as aggressiveness or assertiveness.
