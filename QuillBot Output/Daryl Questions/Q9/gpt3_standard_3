According to the Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT), feelings are the outcome of a person's cognitive assessment of a given circumstance. This theory holds that an individual's cognitive evaluation of a given circumstance, especially its importance to their well-being and the resources they have at their disposal to deal with it, determines their emotional reaction to that event. In the instance of rage, a person may feel this feeling when they consider a situation to be dangerous or unfair and they think they can make a difference. Two different sorts of assessments, according to CAT, may result in the emotion of rage. The first kind is referred to as primary appraisal and entails assessing a situation in terms of its applicability to the wellbeing of the person. Anger will be triggered, for instance, if a person sees a circumstance as a danger or obstacle to their ambitions. The second kind of assessment is referred to as a secondary appraisal, and it entails assessing the tools at hand to handle the circumstance. Anger may be felt when a person believes they can influence the outcome or alter the circumstance. However, a person may experience emotions of helplessness and irritation if they believe they have no control over the circumstance. To provide an example, consider John cutting off another motorist while he is traveling to work. He sees the circumstance as a danger to both his safety and his intention to go to work on time. His first assessment of the circumstance is triggered by this. He then assesses his coping mechanisms and decides to activate his secondary appraisal by honking his horn to let the other vehicle know that he is not satisfied with their actions. CAT contends that a person's cognitive assessment of a circumstance as important to their wellbeing and as something they can influence or modify leads to the sensation of anger. As a reaction to the perceived danger or challenge, this may cause the feeling of rage to surface.
