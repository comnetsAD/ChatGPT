The Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT) describes how people develop distinct emotions depending on their cognitive assessments of a given scenario or occurrence. Emotions, according to CAT, are a person's evaluations of the importance or personal relevance of a certain event or scenario. When it comes to rage, CAT contends that this feeling is brought on when a person perceives that their wants or objectives are being obstructed or interfered with in some manner. When a person considers a situation to be unfair, unjust, or as a danger to their own safety, they may start to feel angry. Think of a person who is travelling on the highway when a vehicle suddenly cuts them off, prompting them to stop hard. A person is prone to feel angry if they believe that their own safety is at danger. Their assessment of the event as a danger stimulates the threat response in the brain, which causes the release of stress hormones and causes emotions of rage. The other driver's selfishness and lack of consideration for other drivers on the road may also lead the individual to see the situation as unfair. This recognition of injustice engages a separate brain network, produces moral indignation, and intensifies the sensation of fury. In conclusion, CAT suggests that anger is brought on when a person perceives a situation as one in which their wants or aspirations are being obstructed or interfered with in some manner. The threat response in the brain is triggered when a person perceives a situation as a danger to their own safety or as an injustice, which results in emotions of rage.
