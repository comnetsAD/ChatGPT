Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT) is a theory that describes how people develop various emotions depending on their cognitive appraisals of a certain scenario or occurrence. Emotions, according to CAT, are the consequence of an individual's assessment of the importance or personal relevance of a certain event or scenario. CAT believes that anger is produced by an individual's assessment of a circumstance as one in which their objectives or desires are being hindered or impeded in some manner. Anger may arise when a person perceives a situation to be unfair, unjust, or a danger to their own well-being. Assume a person is travelling along the highway when a vehicle cuts them off, prompting them to stop unexpectedly. If the individual regards the scenario as a danger to their own safety, they are likely to get enraged. Their assessment of the event as a danger stimulates the brain's threat response, resulting in the release of stress hormones and emotions of rage. Furthermore, the individual may see the scenario as unfair since the other driver's behaviors are selfish and inconsiderate to other cars on the road. This assessment of injustice engages a separate brain network, resulting in moral indignation and reinforcing the emotion of fury. In summary, CAT posits that anger is produced by an individual's perception of a circumstance in which their objectives or desires are hindered or impeded in some manner. The person's assessment that the event is a danger to their own well-being or an injustice stimulates the threat response in the brain, resulting in emotions of rage.
