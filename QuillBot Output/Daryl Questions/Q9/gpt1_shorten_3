CAT discusses how people's cognitive appraisals of a situation or event affect their emotions. CAT states that an individual's evaluation of an event or scenario determines their emotions. CAT suggests that anger is created when a person perceives a circumstance as thwarting their objectives or desires. When they feel wronged or threatened, a person may get angry. For instance, an automobile cuts off a highway driver, forcing them to stop. Anger is probable if the individual feels threatened. Their danger assessment initiates the brain's threat response, producing stress hormones and fury. The other driver's selfishness and disregard for other drivers may also make the situation seem unfair. Injustice stimulates a separate brain network, causing moral indignation and fury. According to CAT, rage is created when a someone perceives a circumstance as thwarting their objectives or desires. The brain's danger response stimulates anger when a person perceives a threat to their well-being or injustice.
