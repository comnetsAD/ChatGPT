Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT) describes how event interpretations cause emotions. CAT states that cognitive assessment determines emotional reactions. CAT implies that a threat or injustice may cause rage. An person perceives an occurrence or circumstance as a danger or injustice to their well-being or ambitions. They then assess the incident or situation's damage and relevance to their aims. Anger will occur if the occurrence or scenario is hurtful or undesirable and connected to their aims or worries. Then, the person will behave aggressively or assertively. If someone gets turned over for a promotion they thought they earned, they may see it as a threat to their professional objectives. They may then assess the occurrence as damaging and important to their aspirations. They will be angry and may communicate their unhappiness to their management. CAT says that a person may get angry when they detect a danger or unfairness, cognitively appraise the incident as detrimental and related to their aims or worries, and react with an action propensity like aggressiveness or assertiveness.
