To put it simply, the cognitive appraisal of a given circumstance or event may lead to a wide range of emotional responses, and the Cognitive Appraisal Theory (CAT) provides an explanation for this. Emotions, as explained by CAT, emerge from one's valuation of the relative importance or personal relevance of external events. Anger, according to the Cognitive Activation Theory (CAT), occurs when a person perceives that his or her wants or desires are being denied or frustrated. Anger may develop when someone views their current condition as unjust or harmful to themselves. Let's say someone is traveling down the highway and is cut off by another automobile, leading them to slam on the brakes. Anger is likely to occur if the individual feels threatened. Their interpretation of the scenario as dangerous sets off the body's fight-or-flight reaction, causing them to feel anxious and eventually angry. Further, the individual may judge the circumstance to be unfair since the other motorist was inconsiderate and careless. This evaluation of wrongdoing stimulates a distinct brain network, which in turn generates moral indignation and amplifies the initial emotion of fury. The core idea behind CAT is that people become angry when they see an obstacle in their path to achieving their desired outcomes. Anger arises when a person's danger reaction in the brain is triggered because they perceive a threat to their safety or an injustice has been committed.
