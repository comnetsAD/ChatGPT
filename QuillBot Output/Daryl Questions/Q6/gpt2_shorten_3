Nature and nurture affect language development. All ordinarily developing people can learn and utilize language, but their environment and experiences affect how they do so. Language is innately provided by nature. The "linguistic instinct" or "universal grammar" may be present from birth. Noam Chomsky's Universal Grammar hypothesis holds that all individuals are born with an intrinsic capacity to learn and comprehend language, based on grammatical principles shared by all languages. Language development depends on nurture too. Language abilities are shaped by the individual's surroundings, particularly the languages spoken around them. According to Vygotsky and others, children acquire language via their parents, caregivers, and peers. Language development depends on social interactions, especially context-based language usage. In conclusion, nature gives language, but culture develops it. The language(s) a kid hears, how they hear it, and their social interactions all affect their language development. Universal Grammar and Social Interactionist theories agree that language development is complicated and impacted by nature and nurture.
