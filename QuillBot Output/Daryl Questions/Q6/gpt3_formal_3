The complicated process of language development is impacted by both nature and nurture. Nature refers to the inherent, biological aspects that contribute to language development, such as the availability of certain brain structures and neural connections required for language processing. The nurture element refers to environmental variables, such as exposure to language, linguistic input, and social interactions, that contribute to language development. The Nativist theory and the Behavioral theory are two ideas that address the role of nature and nurture in language development. Noam Chomsky's nativist theory asserts that people have an intrinsic aptitude for language based on a language-specific module in the brain. According to Chomsky, this intrinsic ability enables infants to absorb whatever language they are exposed to fast and effortlessly. Nativist theory stresses the importance of nature in language development, saying that infants are born with the potential to learn language, which is independent of external variables. According to B.F. Skinner's behavioral theory, language is taught via conditioning and reinforcement. According to Skinner, infants acquire language by copying the speech of adults around them and getting praise for generating language that resembles adult speech. Children acquire language via exposure to language and social interactions, according to the behavioral approach. In conclusion, both nature and nurture impact language development. Behavioral theory stresses the significance of exposure to language and social interactions, while nativist theory emphasizes the role of nature, stating that infants are born with an intrinsic ability for language. Both theories have their own advantages and disadvantages, and it is probable that the process of language development is impacted by a mix of nature and nurture.
