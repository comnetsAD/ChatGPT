The complicated process of language development is impacted by both nature and nurture. All people who are ordinarily developing have the ability to learn and use language, but how that language is learned and utilized may vary widely depending on the environment and experiences of the person. By giving us the intrinsic ability to speak, nature contributes to the evolution of language. It is believed that this ability, often known as the "language instinct" or "universal grammar," is present from birth. According to Noam Chomsky's theory of universal grammar, all people are born with the capacity to learn and comprehend language, and this ability is based on a set of grammatical principles that are shared by all languages. In addition to nature, nurture is essential for language development. The way a person learns a language is influenced by their experiences and surroundings, especially the language(s) that are spoken around them. The Social Interactionist hypothesis, put out by Vygotsky and others, stresses the significance of social interactions in the acquisition of language, contending that infants acquire language via interactions with others, such as parents, carers, and classmates. According to this view, social interactions, including the use of language in context, are essential for language development. In conclusion, although nature gives us the intrinsic ability to speak, nurture molds and develops that ability. A child's language development is significantly influenced by the particular language or languages they are exposed to, how they are exposed to them, and their social interactions with others. This concept that language development is a complicated process that is impacted by both nature and nurture is supported by both the theory of Universal Grammar and the social interactionist view.
