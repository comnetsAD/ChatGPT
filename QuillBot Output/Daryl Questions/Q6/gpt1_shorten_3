It is widely believed that both nature and nurture contribute to language development. The Nativism hypothesis holds that language learning is intrinsic and that individuals are born with a language acquisition device (LAD). Nativists believe language is intrinsic and built into the brain. Social Interactionist theory holds that the environment is fundamental to language development. Social interactionists believe language development is influenced by social interactions and linguistic input. They think that language development depends on the quality and amount of linguistic input and social interactions children get. Thus, nature and nurture influence language development. The ability to learn a language is intrinsic, but the quality and amount of linguistic information and social interactions are also important. In conclusion, language development is not all nature and no nurture. Nativism emphasizes nature and social interactionism nurturing in language development.
