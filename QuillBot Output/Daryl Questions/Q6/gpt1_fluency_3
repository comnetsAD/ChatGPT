The nature vs. nurture argument in language development has a long history, and it is widely agreed that both nature and nurture have a role in language development. The Nativism hypothesis, which holds that the ability to learn language is inherent and that individuals are born with an intrinsic language acquisition device (LAD) that permits them to acquire language, is one theory that supports the importance of nature in language development. Nativists contend that the capacity to learn language is intrinsic and built into the human brain, rather than something that can be learnt. The Social Interactionist view, which holds that the environment is important in language development, is another theory that supports the function of nurture. According to social interactionists, language development is influenced by children's social interactions with their carers as well as the linguistic information they get. They think that the quality and amount of linguistic information received by children, as well as the social interactions they experience, are critical for language development. As a result, it is possible to claim that both nature and nurture have a role in language development. On the one hand, the natural ability to acquire language plays a part in helping people to learn a language, but on the other hand, the quality and amount of linguistic input that people get, as well as the social interactions they have, are critical for language development. To summarize, although all usually growing humans have the ability to learn and use language, this does not imply that language development is entirely natural. Nature and nurture both have a role in language development, with nativism stressing nature and social interactionism emphasizing nurture.
