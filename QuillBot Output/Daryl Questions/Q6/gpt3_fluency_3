Language development is a multifaceted process impacted by both nature and nurture. The intrinsic, biological characteristics that contribute to language development, such as the existence of certain brain structures and neural connections required for language processing, are referred to as the nature aspect. The nurture factor refers to environmental elements that contribute to language development, such as language exposure, language intake, and social interactions. The Nativist theory and the Behavioral theory are two ideas that explore the role of nature and nurture in language development. According to Noam Chomsky's nativist hypothesis, people have an intrinsic aptitude for language that is based on a language-specific module in the brain. According to Chomsky, this intrinsic ability enables youngsters to learn language rapidly and effortlessly, regardless of the language to which they are exposed. The significance of nature in language development is emphasized in nativist theory, which contends that infants are born with the potential to learn language and that this ability is not reliant on external influences. According to B.F. Skinner's behavioral theory, language is taught via conditioning and reinforcement. Children acquire language by copying the speech of people around them and receive positive reinforcement for generating language that is comparable to adult speech, according to Skinner. The significance of nurture in language development is emphasized by behavioral theory, which contends that children acquire language via exposure to language and social interactions. Finally, both nature and nurture impact language development. The role of nature is emphasized in nativist theory, which contends that infants are born with an intrinsic ability for language, while the role of nurture is emphasized in behavioral theory, which contends that children acquire language via exposure to language and social interactions. It is vital to highlight that both theories have strengths and faults, and that the process of language development is most likely impacted by a mix of nature and nurture.
