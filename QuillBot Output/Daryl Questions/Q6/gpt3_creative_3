The process of learning a new language is complex, with environmental and genetic factors both playing roles. The biological, or "natural," aspects include things like the existence of specialized brain structures and neural connections required for language processing. The term "nurture" is used to describe the external elements, such as language use, language intake, and social interactions, that aid in the development of a child's linguistic abilities. The Nativist theory and the Behavioral theory are two perspectives on how nature and nurture interact in the process of language acquisition. Noam Chomsky's nativist hypothesis proposes that there is a language-specific brain module that gives all individuals an intrinsic ability to communicate. Chomsky argues that children have a natural ability that permits them to learn whatever language they are exposed to fast and readily. According to nativist theory, infants are born with the capacity to learn a new language, and this capacity is not influenced by their social or cultural surroundings. As B.F. Skinner's behavioral theory puts it, we pick up language via a process of reinforcement and conditioning. Skinner theorizes that youngsters pick up language by copying the speech of people around them and gaining reinforcement when their imitations sound like the real thing. Behavioral theory places more emphasis on parental influence, saying that children acquire language via exposure to it and contact with others. In conclusion, both biological and environmental factors have a role in shaping a person's linguistic abilities. Children, according to nativist theory, have a predisposed aptitude for language, whereas children, according to behavioral theory, acquire language by exposure to it and contact with others. It's probable that the process of language development is impacted by a mixture of both nature and nurture, but it's crucial to recognize that both theories have their strengths and flaws.
