The process of developing a language is a complicated one that is impacted in many ways by both natural and environmental factors. Even while every normally developing people has the potential to learn and use language, the precise methods in which language is learned and used may vary widely depending on the individual's surroundings and the experiences they have had throughout their lifetime. Through the provision of an intrinsic ability for language, nature plays a role in the evolution of human language. This ability, which is assumed to be present from birth, is referred to as the "language instinct" or the "universal grammar" and goes by either of those names. According to Noam Chomsky's Universal Grammar theory, all humans are born with an innate ability to acquire and understand language, and that this ability is based on a set of grammatical rules that are common to all languages. Chomsky came up with this theory, and he is the one who put forward the theory. In addition, the environment plays an essential part in the formation of language. The development of linguistic abilities is impacted by the individual's surroundings and experiences, particularly the language or languages that are spoken in their immediate area. The Social Interactionist theory, which was proposed by Vygotsky and others, places an emphasis on the role that social interactions play in the development of language. This theory contends that children learn language through interactions with others, such as with their parents, caregivers, and peers. This idea stresses the significance of social interactions, particularly the use of language in context, as fundamental to the evolution of language. To summarize, whereas upbringing is responsible for the shaping and development of linguistic ability, nature is responsible for the intrinsic aptitude for language. The particular language or languages that a kid is exposed to, the manner in which they are exposed to it, and the social interactions that they have with others are all important factors that contribute to the development of a child's language skills. Both the theory of Universal Grammar and the theory of Social Interactionism provide support for the concept that the formation of language is a complicated process that is impacted by both a person's upbringing and their genetic make-up.
