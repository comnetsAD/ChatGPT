The complicated process of language development is impacted by both nature and nurture. While all usually developing humans have the potential to learn and use language, the manner in which language is acquired and used may vary substantially depending on the individual's surroundings and experiences. Nature contributes to the evolution of language by supplying the intrinsic potential for language. This ability is sometimes referred to as "language instinct" or "universal grammar," and it is believed to be present from birth. Noam Chomsky's theory of Universal Grammar asserts that all people are born with an intrinsic capacity to learn and comprehend language, and that this ability is based on a set of grammatical principles shared by all languages. Language development is partly dependent on environmental factors. The individual's surroundings and experiences, especially the language or languages spoken around them, impact the development of their language abilities. The Social Interactionist hypothesis, presented by Vygotsky and others, stresses the relevance of social contacts in language development, contending that infants acquire language via interactions with others, such as their parents, carers, and classmates. This approach stresses the importance of social interactions, particularly language usage in context, for language acquisition. Nature supplies the natural potential for language, but nurture forms and develops it. The precise language or languages a kid is exposed to, the manner in which they are exposed to them, and their social interactions with others all have a key influence in determining their language development. This concept that language development is a complicated process impacted by both nature and nurture is supported by both the theory of Universal Grammar and the Social Interactionist viewpoint.
