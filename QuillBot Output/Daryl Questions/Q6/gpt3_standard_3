The complicated process of language development is impacted by both nature and nurture. The term "nature" refers to the intrinsic, biological elements that influence language acquisition, such as the existence of certain brain regions and neural pathways required for language processing. The environmental elements that influence language development, like as exposure to language, linguistic input, and social interactions, are referred to as the nurture component. The nativist theory and the behavioral theory are two ideas that talk about how nature and nurture interact to shape language development. According to Noam Chomsky's nativist hypothesis, which is based on the idea that the brain has a language-specific module, people are born with the ability to speak. Chomsky claims that regardless of the particular language they are exposed to, infants are born with the ability to learn languages rapidly and effortlessly. The nativist hypothesis places a strong emphasis on nature's involvement in language development, contending that children naturally possess the capacity to learn language and that this capacity is not influenced by external causes. According to the behavioral hypothesis, which was put out by B.F. Skinner, language is acquired via conditioning and reinforcement. According to Skinner, children pick up language by mimicking the speech of the people around them and by being rewarded for speaking in a way that sounds like adults. According to behavioral theory, infants acquire language via exposure to it and social interactions, emphasizing the importance of nurturing in language development. In conclusion, both nature and nurture have an impact on how a person acquires language. While behavioral theory emphasizes the role of nurture and contends that infants acquire language via exposure to it and social interactions, nativist theory stresses the role of nature and contends that children are born with an intrinsic aptitude for language. It's crucial to remember that each theory has its own advantages and disadvantages, and it's probable that both nature and nurture play a role in how language develops.
