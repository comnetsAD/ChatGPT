Nature and nurture affect language development. Language development depends on biological elements including brain architecture and neural connections. Language development is nurtured through language exposure, input, and social interactions. Nativist and behavioral theories explore nature and nurture in language development. Noam Chomsky's nativist hypothesis holds that people are born with a language-specific brain module. Chomsky claims that this natural ability lets children learn any language fast. Nativist theory holds that infants are born with the capacity to learn language, regardless of their surroundings. B.F. Skinner's behavioral theory states that conditioning and reinforcement teach language. Skinner believed that children acquire language by copying adults and being rewarded for doing so. Language development is nurtured, according to behavioral theory. Nature and nurture affect language development. Behavioral theory stresses exposure to language and social interactions, whereas nativist theory emphasizes nature, saying that infants are born with an intrinsic ability for language. Both ideas have pros and cons, and it's probable that nature and nurture impact language development.
