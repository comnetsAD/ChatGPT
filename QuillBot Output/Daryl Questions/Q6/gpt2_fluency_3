Language development is a multifaceted process impacted by both nature and nurture. While all normally growing humans have the ability to learn and use language, the particular methods in which language is learned and utilized may vary substantially depending on the individual's surroundings and experiences. Nature contributes to language development by offering the intrinsic ability to communicate. This ability, known as the "language instinct" or "universal grammar," is assumed to be present from birth. Noam Chomsky's Universal Grammar hypothesis contends that all people are born with an intrinsic capacity to learn and comprehend language, and that this ability is based on a set of grammatical principles shared by all languages. Language development is also influenced by nurture. The individual's surroundings and experiences, including the particular language or languages spoken around them, affect the development of language abilities. Vygotsky and others created the Social Interactionist hypothesis, which stresses the significance of social interactions in language development, saying that children acquire language via interactions with others such as parents, carers, and classmates. This approach stresses the importance of social interactions, particularly language usage in context, for language development. To summarize, although nature offers the intrinsic ability to communicate, it is nurture that forms and develops that ability. The language or languages that a kid is exposed to, the manner in which they are exposed to them, and the social interactions that they have with others all play an important part in molding their language development. Both the Universal Grammar theory and the Social Interactionist view agree that language development is a complicated process impacted by both nature and nurture.
