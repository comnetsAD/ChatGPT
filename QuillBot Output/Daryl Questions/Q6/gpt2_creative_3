The process of learning a new language is complex, with environmental and genetic factors both playing roles. All usually developing people have the innate ability to learn a language and utilize it effectively, although the specifics of this process may vary widely from one person to the next, depending on factors such as upbringing and exposure. The intrinsic ability to learn and use language is something that nature contributes to. This ability, frequently called the "language instinct" or "universal grammar," is said to be present from birth. According to Noam Chomsky's theory of Universal Grammar, people are born knowing how to learn and speak a language, and that knowledge is grounded in a shared set of grammatical principles that apply across all languages. When it comes to learning a new language, environment is just as important as nature. In addition to the particular language or languages one hears on a daily basis, one's surroundings and experiences also have a role in the development of linguistic competence. Children acquire language via interactions with others, such as parents, caretakers, and classmates, according to the Social Interactionist hypothesis put forward by Vygotsky and others. A central tenet of this theory is the importance of naturalistic language usage in the context of social interactions. In conclusion, although nature does supply the intrinsic ability for language, it is nurture that forms and develops the capacity. A child's language development is profoundly affected by the language(s) they are exposed to, the manner in which they are exposed to it, and the social interactions they have with others. Supporting the premise that language acquisition is a multifaceted process impacted by both genetics and environment are the Universal Grammar and Social Interactionist theories.
