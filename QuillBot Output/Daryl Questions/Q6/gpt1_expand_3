It is a dispute that has been going on for a long time over whether or not nature or nurture is more influential in the development of language. However, it is widely agreed that both nature and nurture have a part in the development of language. The nativism theory is a theory that proposes the capacity to acquire language is innate and that humans are born with an innate language acquisition device (LAD) that allows them to acquire language. This theory provides support for the role that nature plays in the development of language, and it is one of the theories that supports the role that nature plays in the development of language. There is a school of thought known as nativism that maintains the capacity to learn a language is not something that can be taught, but rather something that is intrinsic to the human species and is built into the human brain. The Social Interactionist hypothesis is yet another theory that proposes the environment plays a significant part in the development of language. This theory contends that the environment is one of the most important factors in the evolution of language. There is a school of thought known as social interactionism that contends the development of a child's language is dependent not only on their natural capabilities, but also on the social interactions they have with their caretakers and the linguistic information they are given. They are of the opinion that the quality and amount of linguistic information that children get, in addition to the social interactions that they have, are important factors in the development of language in children. As a result, one may claim that the two factors, nature and nurture, both play a part in the formation of language. The innate ability to learn a language is one factor that contributes to an individual's success in acquiring a second language; however, the significance of the quality and quantity of linguistic input an individual receives as well as the social interactions they participate in cannot be overstated in terms of their importance for the development of language. To summarize, although it is accurate to say that people of all ages and stages of development have the potential to learn and use language, this does not always imply that language acquisition and use are only the product of natural causes. Both nature and nurture play a part in the formation of language, with nativism putting more of an emphasis on the role nature plays and social interactionism putting more of an emphasis on the role nurture plays.
