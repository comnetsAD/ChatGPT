The nature vs. nurture argument in language development has persisted for a while, and it is now widely acknowledged that both nature and nurture contribute to language development. The Nativism hypothesis, which contends that people are born with an intrinsic language acquisition device (LAD) that enables them to learn language, is one idea that supports the importance of nature in language development. Nativists contend that language acquisition is an intrinsic skill that is built into the human brain rather than something that must be acquired. The Social Interactionist view, which contends that the environment has a significant impact on language development, is another theory that affirms the importance of nurture in language development. Social interactionists contend that social interactions between children and their caregivers and linguistic input are equally as important to language development as intrinsic ability. They contend that social interactions and the number and quality of linguistic exposure children get are essential for language development. Therefore, it may be claimed that the formation of language is influenced by both nature and nurture. Both the amount and quality of linguistic information that people get as well as their social interactions are essential for language development. On the one hand, people's intrinsic ability to learn languages plays a role in their ability to learn a language. In conclusion, even if it is true that all people who are generally developing have the ability to learn and use language, this does not imply that language development is just a product of nature. Language development is influenced by both nature and nurture, with nativism stressing the influence of nature and social interactionism the influence of nurture.
