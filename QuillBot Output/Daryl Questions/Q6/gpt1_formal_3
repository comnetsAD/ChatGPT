It is widely agreed that both nature and nurture have a role in the formation of language, since the nature versus nurture argument in language acquisition has a long history. The Nativism hypothesis proposes that the ability to learn language is inherent and that individuals are born with a language acquisition device (LAD) that enables them to acquire language. This theory supports the importance of nature in language development. Nativists contend that the capacity to acquire a language is intrinsic and encoded in the human brain, as opposed to something that can be taught. The Social Interactionist hypothesis, which believes that the environment plays a key role in the formation of language, is another theory that emphasizes the function of nurture in language acquisition. Social interactionists contend that language development is dependent not just on natural ability, but also on children's social interactions with their caregivers and the linguistic input they get. They think that the amount and quality of linguistic information children get, as well as their social interactions, are essential for language development. Consequently, it may be claimed that both nature and nurture influence language development. Individuals' intrinsic ability to acquire language has a part in their ability to learn a language, but the quality and amount of linguistic information they get and their social interactions are vital for language development. In conclusion, although it is true that all persons with normal development have the potential to learn and use language, this does not imply that language development is entirely determined by nature. Nature and nurture both have a role in language development, with nativism stressing nature and social interactionism emphasizing nurture.
