There has been an ongoing discussion over the relative importance of genetics and environment in shaping language, with most researchers now agreeing that both factors contribute to linguistic maturation. Nativism is a theory that supports the idea that nature has a role in language development by proposing that individuals are born with a language acquisition device (LAD) that enables them to learn new languages. Some people, known as nativists, believe that learning a new language isn't something you can do; rather, it's something that's built into your brain from birth. The Social Interactionist hypothesis, which believes that the environment plays a key role in the formation of language, is another theory that emphasizes the function of nurture in language acquisition. Some researchers, known as social interactionists, believe that toddlers learn language via their interactions with adults and the language they hear around them. They believe that children's exposure to both high-quality and high-quantity linguistic information, as well as meaningful social interactions, are essential for their linguistic development. Thus, it is possible to claim that both biological and environmental factors contribute to language acquisition. While it's true that some people have a natural talent for picking up new tongues, it's also true that the quality and amount of linguistic information a person receives, as well as the relationships they have with others, are critical factors in language acquisition and growth. In conclusion, although it is true that all usually growing people have the potential to learn and use language, this does not indicate that language development is entirely determined by genetics. It is widely agreed that both biological and environmental factors contribute to language acquisition, with nativism highlighting the former and social interactionism the latter.
