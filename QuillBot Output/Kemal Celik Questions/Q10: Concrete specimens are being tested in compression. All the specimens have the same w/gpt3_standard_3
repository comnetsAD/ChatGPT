The water-to-cement ratio (w/c ratio) and curing conditions will affect the compression strength of concrete. The samples that are examined wet or in a saturated surface dry (SSD) environment will be more robust than the samples that are tested dry. This is because the cement is more thoroughly hydrated in the wet sample since there is more water available to hydrate the cement. As a consequence, the cement paste and aggregate are better bonded together, resulting in a stronger, more dense concrete. When concrete is tested dry, the cement paste will dry out due to a lack of water, which might lead to weaker concrete. Additionally, the dry specimens could be more likely to break, which would lessen their total strength. It is also crucial to note that curing conditions have a significant impact on concrete strength. Concrete must be kept wet and at a certain temperature for a predetermined amount of time after it has been put in order for it to cure. By enabling adequate cement hydration and reducing the rate of moisture loss from the concrete, curing aids in ensuring that the concrete achieves its full strength. No matter whether the concrete was tested dry or wet, proper curing is necessary to maximize its strength.
