The concrete specimens that are tested while they are still wet will have a higher strength than those that are tested while they are still dry. The reason for this is because the addition of water to the concrete helps to hydrate the cement, which in turn serves to increase the link that exists between the cement and the aggregate particles. This results in an increase in the aggregate's total compressive strength. In addition, the water that is included inside the concrete helps to fill any voids that may be present in the mixture, which is another factor that may contribute to the increased strength of the concrete. The aggregate particles in concrete are held together by the cement paste that surrounds them when the material is subjected to a compression test. This test causes the aggregate particles to be compressed together. Because the paste forms a stronger link with the aggregate when it is hydrated, wet concrete is stronger than dry concrete. This is because the bond between the aggregate and the paste is stronger when the paste is hydrated. It is important to keep in mind that if the concrete specimens are found to be dry after being tested, this indicates that the concrete did not cure correctly; if the concrete is not cured properly, the strength will be diminished. After the concrete has been laid, the process of curing entails ensuring that the moisture and temperature conditions are kept at the appropriate levels. Because of this, the concrete is able to achieve its utmost potential for strength and durability.
