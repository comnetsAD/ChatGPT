Wet concrete specimens will be stronger than dry concrete specimens. The reason for this is that water aids in the hydration of the cement in the concrete, which improves the binding between the cement and aggregate particles. This increases the concrete's overall strength. Furthermore, the water in the concrete helps to fill any gaps in the mixture, which may boost the concrete's strength. When concrete is compressed, the aggregate particles are forced together and held together by the cement paste that surrounds them. Wet concrete is stronger than dry concrete because the link between the aggregate and the paste is stronger when the paste is hydrated. It's worth mentioning that if the concrete specimens are tested dry, it suggests they weren't fully cured, and if the concrete isn't properly cured, its strength suffers. Curing is the process of ensuring that the right moisture and temperature conditions are maintained after the concrete has been laid. This enables the concrete to achieve its greatest strength and durability.
