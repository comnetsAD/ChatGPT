The w/c ratio and curing conditions affect concrete compression strength. Wet specimens are stronger than dry ones. Wet specimens have more water to hydrate the cement, which completes the cement-water reaction. This strengthens, densifies, and bonds cement paste and aggregate. Dry concrete is weaker because the cement paste dries out. Dry specimens may break more, weakening them. Curing conditions can affect concrete strength. After placement, concrete is kept wet and at a specified temperature to cure. Curing allows cement to hydrate correctly and slows moisture loss from the concrete, ensuring optimum strength. Wet or dry, concrete must be properly cured to reach its maximum strength potential.
