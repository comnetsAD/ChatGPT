Without knowing further details regarding the particular w/c ratio and the qualities of the concrete being used, it is impossible to predict which specimen will be stronger. In general, specimens of concrete that have been examined wet are usually stronger than those that have been tested dry. This is due to the fact that water aids in hydrating the cement present in concrete, improving the connection between the cement and aggregate and raising the concrete's overall strength. The additional water in the mixture may also aid in filling any gaps in the concrete, adding to its strength. Conversely, specimens of concrete that are evaluated dry may be weaker as a result of the absence of a curing and hydration process.
