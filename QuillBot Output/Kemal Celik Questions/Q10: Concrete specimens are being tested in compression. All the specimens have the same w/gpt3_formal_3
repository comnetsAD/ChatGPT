The compressive strength of concrete depends on the water-to-cement ratio (w/c ratio) and curing conditions. The specimens that are evaluated wet or under a saturated surface dry (SSD) state will be stronger than those that are tested dry. This is because there is more water available to hydrate the cement in the wet specimens, resulting in a more thorough interaction between cement and water. This results in concrete that is denser, stronger, and has a stronger link between the cement paste and aggregate. When concrete is tested dry, the absence of water may dry up the cement paste, resulting in weaker concrete. Dry specimens may also have a greater propensity to fracture, hence diminishing their total strength. It is also crucial to note that curing conditions have a significant impact on the strength of concrete. After it has been poured, concrete must be kept wet and at a certain temperature for a length of time. Curing ensures that the concrete achieves its full strength by enabling the cement to hydrate correctly and by reducing the rate of moisture loss. Regardless of whether the concrete was tested wet or dry, it must be properly cured to obtain its maximum strength potential.
