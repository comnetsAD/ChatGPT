The compressive strength of concrete is determined by the water-to-cement ratio (w/c ratio) and the curing conditions. The specimens tested wet or under saturated surface dry (SSD) conditions will be stronger than the ones tested dry. Because wet specimens have more water available to hydrate the cement, the interaction between the cement and water is more complete. As a consequence, the concrete is stronger and denser, with a better connection between the cement paste and aggregate. When testing dry concrete, the absence of water causes the cement paste to dry up, resulting in weaker concrete. Dry specimens may also be more prone to cracking, diminishing overall strength. It is also worth noting that curing conditions have an impact on concrete strength. Concrete curing refers to the process of keeping it wet and at a certain temperature after it has been poured. Curing aids in the strength of the concrete by enabling the cement to properly hydrate and slows the rate of moisture loss from the concrete. Proper curing is required to attain the maximum strength capability of the concrete, whether wet or dry tested.
