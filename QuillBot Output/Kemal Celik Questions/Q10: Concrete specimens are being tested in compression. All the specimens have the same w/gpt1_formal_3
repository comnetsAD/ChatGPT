Wet-tested concrete specimens will be stronger than dry-tested specimens. Water aids in hydrating the cement in concrete, hence enhancing the connection between the cement and aggregate particles. This enhances the concrete's overall strength. In addition, the water in the concrete serves to fill any gaps in the mixture, so increasing the concrete's strength. When concrete is subjected to a compression test, the aggregate particles are compressed and held together by the cement paste that surrounds them. Wet concrete is stronger than dry concrete because the link between the aggregate and paste is strengthened when the paste is hydrated. Notably, if the concrete specimens are tested dry, it indicates that they were not adequately cured, and if the concrete was not completely cured, its strength would be diminished. Curing is the process of preserving the correct moisture and temperature conditions after placing concrete. This enables the concrete to achieve its optimal strength and durability.
