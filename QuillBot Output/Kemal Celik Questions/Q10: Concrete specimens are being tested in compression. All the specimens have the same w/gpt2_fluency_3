It is impossible to predict which specimen will be stronger without knowing more about the precise w/c ratio and concrete qualities. Concrete specimens that have been examined wet are often stronger than those that have been evaluated dry. This is due to the fact that water aids in the hydration of the cement in the concrete, which enhances the binding between the cement and aggregate and raises the overall strength of the concrete. Furthermore, the additional water in the mix may assist to fill any gaps in the concrete, improving its strength even further. Concrete specimens evaluated dry, on the other hand, may be weaker owing to a lack of curing and hydration.
