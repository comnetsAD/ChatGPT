Without having additional information regarding the particular w/c ratio and the qualities of the concrete that is being utilized, it is impossible to predict which specimen will be the stronger of the two. Concrete specimens that are assessed when wet are often found to have a higher strength rating than those that are evaluated while dry. This is due to the fact that water assists in the process of hydrating the cement in the concrete, which in turn strengthens the link between the cement and aggregate, which in turn contributes to an increase in the concrete's overall strength. Additionally, the additional water in the mix may assist in filling any voids that may be present in the concrete, which further contributes to the concrete's increased strength. On the other side, concrete specimens that are evaluated dry can be weaker than those that are wet since there won't be enough time for them to cure and hydrate.
