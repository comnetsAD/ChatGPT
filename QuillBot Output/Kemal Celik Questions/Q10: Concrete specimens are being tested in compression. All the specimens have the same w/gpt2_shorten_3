Without knowing the w/c ratio and concrete qualities, it is hard to predict which specimen will be stronger. Wet concrete specimens are stronger than dry ones. Water hydrates cement in concrete, improving the link between cement and aggregate and strengthening the concrete. The additional water in the mix may also fill concrete gaps, strengthening it. Due to lack of curing and hydration, dry concrete specimens may be weaker.
