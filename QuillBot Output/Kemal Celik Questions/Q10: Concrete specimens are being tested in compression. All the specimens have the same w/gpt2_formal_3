Without further information on the particular w/c ratio and concrete qualities, it is impossible to determine which specimen will be the strongest. In general, wet-tested concrete specimens are often stronger than their dry counterparts. This is because water helps hydrate the cement in concrete, which strengthens the link between the cement and aggregate and raises the concrete's overall strength. Additionally, the additional water in the mixture may aid to fill any gaps, so enhancing the concrete's strength. In contrast, dry-tested concrete specimens may be weaker owing to the absence of curing and hydration.
