Wet concrete specimens are stronger. Water hydrates cement in concrete, which strengthens the cement-aggregate link. This strengthens concrete. Water in concrete also fills cavities, which strengthens it. The cement paste binds aggregate particles together when concrete is compressed. Wet concrete is stronger than dry concrete because hydrated paste strengthens the aggregate-paste connection. Note that dry concrete examples indicate improper curing, which reduces strength. Curing involves keeping the right moisture and temperature after placing concrete. This maximizes concrete strength and durability.
