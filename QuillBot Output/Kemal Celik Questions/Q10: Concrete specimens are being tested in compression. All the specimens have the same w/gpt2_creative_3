Without knowing the precise w/c ratio and the qualities of the concrete, it is impossible to predict which specimen will be stronger. In most cases, the strength of a concrete sample increases when it is evaluated wet rather than dry. This is due to the fact that water aids in hydrating the cement in the concrete, which in turn strengthens the link between the cement and aggregate and the concrete as a whole. The added water in the recipe may also fill any air pockets in the concrete, which boosts the material's overall strength. Conversely, the curing and hydration process may be compromised in dry-tested concrete specimens, making them more susceptible to failure.
