Recycled water from industrial processes may be used to mix concrete, however the quality of the recycled water and the particular needs of the concrete mixture must be considered. To guarantee that the concrete sets and hardens correctly, the water used in it must fulfill specified criteria for pH, total dissolved solids, and other factors. Industrial processes may produce water with high levels of dissolved salt and other contaminants, which may not fulfill these limits. Seawater may also be utilized as a concrete mixing water, however it has significant drawbacks. Seawater includes significant quantities of salt, which may induce corrosion of steel reinforcement in concrete as well as impair its setting and hardening. When employing saltwater as a mixing water in concrete, particular processes such as preparation of seawater and the use of corrosion-inhibiting admixtures are necessary. Furthermore, the cost and availability of saltwater in certain places must be considered. It is also crucial to remember that using recycled or saltwater may need extra testing and monitoring to ensure that the concrete fulfills the requisite strength and durability criteria.
