It is not suggested to utilize recycled water from industrial processes as mixing water in concrete because of the potential health risks. This is due to the fact that the water may include impurities and chemicals, both of which have the potential to have an impact on the qualities of the concrete and the strength of the finished product. In addition to this, there is a possibility that the water is tainted with heavy metals or other potentially hazardous compounds that are hazardous to both the environment and the employees. On the other hand, using seawater as the mixing water in concrete is generally not recommended due to the high salt content of seawater. This high salt content can cause corrosion of steel reinforcement and can also affect the properties of the concrete. In general, using seawater as the mixing water in concrete is not recommended. Because of the high salt concentration, the concrete may have a lower compressive strength than normal and also may have a larger permeability than normal as a result of the salt content. In addition, the high salt concentration might make the concrete less resistant to the freezing and thawing cycles than it otherwise would be. However, it is important to note that under certain circumstances, it is possible to use seawater as the mixing water for concrete. One example would be in remote coastal locations that do not have access to any source of freshwater. Another example would be in certain marine structures, such as offshore oil platforms, where seawater is the only source of water that is available. In these circumstances, concrete mix designs are used that are particularly adapted to the elevated salt of the ocean, and the concrete itself is often reinforced with components that are resistant to corrosion. Because potable water does not include any impurities or chemicals, it is the kind of water that should be used while mixing concrete. These types of contaminants and chemicals have the potential to alter the qualities of the concrete. However, in some circumstances, when saltwater is the sole source of accessible water, additional attention and design must be taken into account in order to counteract the impacts of the high salt content on the concrete. This is the case since seawater is saltier than freshwater.
