It is not advised to mix concrete using recycled water from industrial processes. This is due to the possibility that the water contains contaminants and chemicals that may impact the qualities of the concrete and the end product's strength. In addition, the water may include heavy metals or other dangerous contaminants that might damage the environment or the employees. However, because to its high salt content, which may damage concrete's characteristics and cause steel reinforcing to corrode, it is typically not advised to use saltwater while mixing concrete. The concrete's high salt content may result in both a reduction in compressive strength and an increase in permeability. In addition, concrete with a high salt concentration may be less resistant to freeze-thaw cycles. However, it is important to keep in mind that under some specific circumstances, such as in remote coastal areas without access to freshwater or in certain marine structures, such as offshore oil platforms, where seawater is the only source of water, it is possible to use seawater as the mixing water for concrete. In these situations, high-salinity seawater-specific concrete mix designs are used, and the concrete is often reinforced with corrosion-resistant elements. Therefore, it is generally advised to use potable water while mixing concrete since it is devoid of contaminants and chemicals that might damage the concrete's qualities. To counteract the negative impacts of excessive salt content on the concrete, particular thought and design must be made for certain situations when saltwater is the sole source of accessible water.
