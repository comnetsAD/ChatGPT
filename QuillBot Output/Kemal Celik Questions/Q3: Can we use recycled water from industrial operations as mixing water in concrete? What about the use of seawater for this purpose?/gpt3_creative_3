Depending on the quality of the water and the particular needs of the concrete mix, recycled water from industrial processes may be utilized as mixing water in concrete. There are requirements for the water's pH, total dissolved solids, chlorides, and other impurities that must be met. It is also important that the recycled water not include any contaminants that might weaken the concrete. Since of the high quantities of salt (chlorides) in saltwater, using seawater as mixing water in concrete is typically not advised because it may corrode the steel reinforcement in concrete and diminish the strength and longevity of the concrete. In addition, efflorescence (white salt deposits on the surface of the concrete) and spalling may be brought on by the high salt content of saltwater. However, recent research suggests that using saltwater as mixing water is viable when certain chemical admixtures, such as calcium nitrite, are used in the concrete recipe. It is also possible to utilize seawater with a reduced salt concentration or desalination as the concrete mixing water. If you're thinking of using recycled water or saltwater in your concrete, make sure you talk to an expert in the industry first to be sure it will work for your project.
