Depending on the concrete mix and water quality, recycled industrial water may be utilized as mixing water. pH, TDS, chlorides, and other pollutants must fulfill water quality criteria. Recycled water must be clean to avoid weakening concrete. Seawater is not advised for mixing concrete because it includes significant quantities of salt (chlorides) that may corrode steel reinforcing and diminish concrete strength and durability. Seawater's high salt concentration causes efflorescence (white salt deposits on concrete) and cracking and spalling. Some research suggest using saltwater as mixing water by adding chemical admixtures such calcium nitrite to the concrete mix. Concrete mixing water may also be desalinated or low-salinity seawater. To ensure that recycled or seawater concrete fulfills application specifications, contact a specialist.
