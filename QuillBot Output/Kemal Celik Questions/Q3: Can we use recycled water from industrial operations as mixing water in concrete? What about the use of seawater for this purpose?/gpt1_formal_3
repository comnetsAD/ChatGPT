It is not suggested to utilize recycled water from industrial activities as concrete mixing water. This is due to the fact that the water may include pollutants and chemicals that might impact the qualities of the concrete and the end product's strength. Furthermore, the water may be polluted with heavy metals or other hazardous compounds that are hazardous to the environment and employees. The use of saltwater as a mixing water in concrete, on the other hand, is typically not suggested owing to its high salt content, which may cause corrosion of steel reinforcement and impair the qualities of the concrete. The high salt concentration in the concrete might lead it to have a lower compressive strength as well as a greater permeability. Furthermore, the excessive salt concentration may lead the concrete to be less resistant to freeze-thaw cycles. It is worth mentioning, however, that under some situations, such as in isolated coastal locales with no access to freshwater or in particular maritime constructions such as offshore oil platforms where saltwater is the only accessible water supply, seawater may be used as a concrete mixing water. Concrete mix designs that are specially adapted to the high salinity of saltwater are employed in these circumstances, and the concrete is often strengthened with corrosion-resistant elements. In general, potable water is preferred for mixing concrete since it is devoid of pollutants and chemicals that might damage the qualities of the concrete. However, careful attention and design must be taken into account in certain scenarios when saltwater is the only accessible water supply to reduce the impacts of excessive salt content on the concrete.
