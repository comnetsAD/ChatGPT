Recycled water from industrial processes may be used to mix concrete, however the quality of the water and the particular needs of the concrete mix must be considered. Water quality regulations for pH, total dissolved solids, chlorides, and other pollutants must be met. Furthermore, the recycled water must be free of impurities that might compromise the strength or durability of the concrete. The use of saltwater as a concrete mixing water is typically not suggested because seawater contains significant amounts of salt (chlorides), which may corrode the steel reinforcement in concrete and diminish its strength and durability. Furthermore, the high salt content of saltwater may produce efflorescence (white salt deposits on the surface of the concrete) as well as cracking and spalling. However, depending on the particular needs, certain studies demonstrate that by adding certain chemical admixtures to the concrete mix, such as calcium nitrite, the use of saltwater as mixing water is viable. Additionally, desalinated saltwater or seawater with a reduced salt concentration may be utilized as concrete mixing water. When contemplating the use of recycled or saltwater in concrete, it is important to check with a professional or expert in the industry to ensure that it fits the criteria and requirements for the particular application.
