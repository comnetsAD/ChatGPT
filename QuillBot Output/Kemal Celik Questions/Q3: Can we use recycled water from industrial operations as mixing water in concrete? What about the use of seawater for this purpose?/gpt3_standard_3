It is possible to mix concrete using recycled water from industrial processes, however this will rely on the water's quality and the particular specifications of the concrete mix. The water's pH, total dissolved solids, chlorides, and other pollutants must all be under specific limits. The recycled water also has to be free of contaminants that can compromise the concrete's strength or durability. Because saltwater includes significant quantities of salt (chlorides), which may corrode the steel reinforcement in concrete and decrease its strength and durability, it is typically not advised to utilize seawater as the water used to mix concrete. In addition, seawater's high salt concentration may produce efflorescence, or white salt deposits on concrete's surface, as well as cracking and spalling. However, some research suggest that using saltwater as the mixing water for concrete may be accomplished depending on the particular needs by adding appropriate chemical admixtures, such as calcium nitrite, to the concrete mix. Additionally, saltwater that has been desalinated or has a low salt concentration may be utilized as the water for concrete mixing. When contemplating the use of recycled or saltwater in concrete, it is crucial to speak with a specialist or industry expert to ensure that it satisfies the criteria and specifications for the particular application.
