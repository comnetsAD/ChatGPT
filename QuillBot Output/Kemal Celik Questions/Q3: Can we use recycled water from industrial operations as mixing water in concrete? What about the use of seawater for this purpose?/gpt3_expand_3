It is possible to utilize recycled water from industrial processes as the mixing water in concrete, but the viability of this practice is contingent on the quality of the water as well as the particular needs of the concrete mix. Certain water quality criteria, including those pertaining to pH, total dissolved solids, chlorides, and other pollutants, have to be satisfied by the water. In addition, any impurities that can have an adverse effect on the concrete's strength or durability must be eliminated from the recycled water before it can be used. It is generally not recommended to use seawater as the mixing water in concrete because seawater contains high levels of salt (chlorides), which can corrode the steel reinforcement in concrete and reduce the strength and durability of the concrete. However, it is possible to use seawater as the mixing water in concrete. In addition, the high concentration of salt in saltwater may lead to efflorescence, which is characterized by the appearance of white salt deposits on the surface of the concrete, as well as cracking and spalling in the material. However, depending on the particular needs, certain research have shown that it may be feasible to utilize saltwater as mixing water if the concrete mix is supplemented with suitable chemical admixtures. One example of these admixtures is calcium nitrite. [Citation needed] In addition, concrete may be mixed with water that has been desalinated from the ocean or that has a low salt concentration. Both of these types of water can be found in the ocean. When contemplating the use of recycled water or saltwater in concrete, it is essential to discuss the matter with a trained professional or an industry expert in order to guarantee that the material satisfies all of the criteria and requirements for the particular application in question.
