Recycled industrial water may be used to mix concrete, depending on its quality and the mix's needs. To set and harden, concrete water must fulfill pH, total dissolved solids, and other criteria. Industrial water may not fulfill these criteria due to high dissolved salt and contaminants. Seawater can mix concrete, but it has drawbacks. Salt in seawater may corrode steel reinforcement in concrete and impair its setting and hardening. When mixing concrete with saltwater, pretreatment and corrosion-inhibiting admixtures are needed. Consider regional seawater costs and availability. Recycled or saltwater concrete may need extra testing and monitoring to fulfill strength and durability criteria.
