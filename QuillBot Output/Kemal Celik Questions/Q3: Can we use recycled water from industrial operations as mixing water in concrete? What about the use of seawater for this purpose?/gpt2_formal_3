Depending on the quality of the recycled water and the particular needs of the concrete mixture, recycled water from industrial processes may be utilized as mixing water in concrete. Water used in concrete must fulfill specified criteria for pH, total dissolved solids, and other characteristics to guarantee appropriate setting and hardening of the concrete. Industrial processes may produce water with high concentrations of dissolved salt and other contaminants, which may not match these criteria. Seawater may also be utilized as concrete mixing water, although it presents additional complications. High quantities of salt in seawater may induce corrosion of steel reinforcement in concrete and impact the setting and hardening of concrete. When utilizing saltwater as mixing water in concrete, particular procedures such as preparation of seawater and the use of corrosion-inhibiting admixtures are necessary. In addition, it is essential to consider the price and availability of saltwater in certain places. Noting that the use of recycled or saltwater may need extra testing and monitoring to verify that the concrete satisfies the requisite criteria for strength and durability is also significant.
