Recycled water from industrial processes may be utilized as concrete mixing water, depending on the water's quality and the particular needs of the concrete mix. Certain water quality criteria must be met for pH, total dissolved solids, chlorides, and other pollutants. In addition, the recycled water must be devoid of contaminants that might compromise the concrete's strength or longevity. Because saltwater includes significant quantities of salt (chlorides), it may corrode the steel reinforcement in concrete and diminish the concrete's strength and longevity. In addition, the high salt content of saltwater may produce efflorescence (white salt deposits on the surface of the concrete) as well as concrete cracking and spalling. However, depending on the particular needs, some research indicate that saltwater may be used as mixing water by adding chemical additives such as calcium nitrite to the concrete mixture. Additionally, desalinated saltwater or seawater with a low salt level may be used as concrete mixing water. When contemplating the use of recycled or saltwater in concrete, it is essential to contact a professional or an expert in the industry to ensure that it fits the criteria and requirements for the particular use.
