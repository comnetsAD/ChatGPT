Concrete strength depends on the aggregate-to-cement ratio. A greater aggregate-to-cement ratio implies less cement to bond the aggregate, making concrete weaker. A lower aggregate-to-cement ratio indicates more cement binds the aggregate, making concrete stronger. Curing conditions can affect concrete strength. Proper curing—keeping the concrete wet and at a steady temperature—helps cement hydrate properly, making the concrete stronger. Incomplete hydration or cracking may weaken concrete from improper curing. Mixing and placement: How concrete is mixed, put, and compacted affects its strength. Voids, segregation, and bleeding may weaken a product due to improper mixing, placement, and compaction. Admixtures: Chemical substances are added to concrete to enhance its qualities. They increase product workability, set time, strength, and durability.
