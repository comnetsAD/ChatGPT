Two more major elements affecting concrete strength are: Dimensions: The concrete's strength depends on the aggregate's size and form. Smaller aggregate particles make weaker concrete, whereas larger ones make stronger concrete. Angular aggregate particles provide stronger concrete than rounder ones. Curing: Concrete strength depends on curing. Curing involves keeping the concrete wet and at an appropriate temperature after placement to enable the hydration process to continue and the concrete to strengthen. Concrete will lose strength if not adequately cured. The Water-Cement ratio (W/C) is one of the most critical parameters affecting concrete strength and durability, although curing conditions, aggregate type, gradation, and mineralogy, air content, temperature, and humidity may all effect concrete strength.
