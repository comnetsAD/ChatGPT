Abrams discovered the water-cement ratio as a crucial element in the relationship between concrete strength and durability. However, a number of other elements also significantly affect the strength of concrete, such as: Ratio of aggregate to cement: The amount of cement to aggregate (sand, gravel, etc.) in the concrete mixture also significantly affects the strength of the concrete. As the aggregate adds stability and strength to the mix, a greater aggregate-to-cement ratio often yields stronger concrete. Curing circumstances: Concrete must be properly cured in order to be strong and long-lasting. Curing is the process of maintaining a certain temperature and moisture content while a substance is hardening. Stronger concrete will come from a good curing environment that keeps the concrete wet and at the right temperature. In conclusion, the aggregate-to-cement ratio and curing conditions are two other parameters that have a major impact on concrete strength in addition to the water-cement ratio.
