Abrams identified the water-cement ratio as a key aspect relating to concrete strength. However, there are various other elements that have a substantial impact on concrete strength, such as: Ratio of aggregate to cement: The aggregate (sand, gravel, etc.) to cement ratio in the concrete mix is also important in influencing the strength of the concrete. A greater aggregate-to-cement ratio produces stronger concrete because the aggregate adds strength and stability to the mix. Curing circumstances: Concrete curing is critical to its strength and longevity. Curing is the technique of keeping a constant moisture and temperature level throughout the hardening process. Stronger concrete will come from an appropriate curing environment, such as keeping the concrete wet and at a reasonable temperature. In conclusion, the aggregate-to-cement ratio and curing conditions, in addition to the water-cement ratio, have a major impact on concrete strength.
