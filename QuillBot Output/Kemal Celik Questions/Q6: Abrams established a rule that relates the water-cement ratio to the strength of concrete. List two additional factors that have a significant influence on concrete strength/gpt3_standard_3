The following two additional elements significantly affect the strength of concrete: aggregate dimensions and form: The strength of the concrete may be significantly impacted by the size and form of the aggregate (stones or gravel) used in the concrete mix. Generally speaking, concrete with larger aggregate particles will be stronger than concrete with smaller aggregate particles. Similar to how sharper aggregate particles produce stronger concrete than rounder ones. Curing: The growth of concrete's strength depends on proper curing. After the concrete has been laid, it must be kept wet and at an appropriate temperature for a while in order for the hydration process to continue and the concrete to build strength. This process is known as curing. Concrete won't reach its maximum strength potential if it is not properly cured. In addition to curing conditions, aggregate type, gradation, and mineralogy, air content, temperature, and humidity, it is important to note that the Water-Cement ratio (W/C) is one of the most crucial factors that affects the strength and durability of concrete. However, other factors such as these can also significantly affect the final strength of the concrete.
