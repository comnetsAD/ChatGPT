Abrams' water-cement ratio affects concrete strength. However, various other variables affect concrete strength, including: Ratio: The concrete mix's aggregate-to-cement ratio also affects its strength. Since aggregate strengthens and stabilizes concrete, a larger aggregate-to-cement ratio makes it stronger. Healing: Concrete strength depends on curing. Curing involves regulating moisture and temperature during hardening. Keeping the concrete wet and at the right temperature can strengthen it. The water-cement ratio, aggregate-to-cement ratio, and curing conditions all affect concrete strength.
