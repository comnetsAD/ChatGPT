The following are two more aspects that have a crucial role in determining the strength of concrete: Size and form of the aggregate: The aggregate (stones or gravel) that is used in the concrete mix may have a major impact on the strength of the concrete, and this impact can be significantly influenced by the size and form of the aggregate. Concrete with smaller aggregate particles will normally produce a weaker product, whereas concrete with larger aggregate particles will often produce a stronger product. In a similar vein, having aggregate particles that are more angular will result in concrete that is stronger than having particles that are more rounded. Curing: The growth of concrete's strength is directly proportional to how well it is allowed to cure. Curing is the act of maintaining the concrete by keeping it damp and at an appropriate temperature for a length of time after it has been poured. This is done in order to enable the hydration process to continue, which is necessary for the concrete to build strength. Concrete will not reach its full potential for strength if the curing process is not carried out correctly. It is important to note that the Water-Cement ratio (W/C) is one of the most important factors that affect the strength and durability of concrete; however, other factors such as curing conditions, aggregate type, gradation, and mineralogy, air content, temperature, and humidity can also have a significant influence on the final strength of the concrete.
