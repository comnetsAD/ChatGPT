Abrams determined that the water-cement ratio is a significant component in determining the strength of concrete. However, numerous more elements can have a substantial impact on the strength of concrete, including: Aggregate-to-cement ratio: The ratio of aggregate (sand, gravel, etc.) to cement in the concrete mixture also plays a major effect in defining the concrete's strength. The aggregate imparts strength and stability to the mix, therefore a greater aggregate-to-cement ratio often results in stronger concrete. Curing ailments: Concrete's strength and longevity are dependent on its proper curing. Curing is the technique of maintaining a certain amount of moisture and temperature during the process of hardening. A correct curing environment, including keeping the concrete wet and at an appropriate temperature, will result in concrete that is stronger. In conclusion, in addition to the water-cement ratio, the aggregate-to-cement ratio and curing circumstances have a major impact on concrete strength.
