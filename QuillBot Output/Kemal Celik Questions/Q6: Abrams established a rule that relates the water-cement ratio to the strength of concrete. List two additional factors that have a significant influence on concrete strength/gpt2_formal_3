Ratio of aggregate to cement: The ratio of aggregate (sand and gravel) to cement is crucial to the durability of concrete. A greater aggregate-to-cement ratio indicates there is less cement to bond the aggregate, which might result in concrete that is weaker. A lower aggregate-to-cement ratio indicates that there is more cement to bond the aggregate, which may result in concrete that is stronger. The curing conditions have a considerable impact on the concrete's strength. Proper curing, which is the process of keeping the concrete wet and at a constant temperature, may guarantee that the cement hydrates correctly, resulting in concrete that is stronger. Insufficient curing might result in concrete that is weaker owing to inadequate hydration or cracking. Mixing and placement: The manner in which concrete is mixed, put, and compacted also affects its strength. Improper mixing, placing, and compaction may result in voids, segregation, or bleeding, which can compromise the final product's strength. Admixtures are chemical chemicals that are added to concrete to enhance or alter its qualities. They may enhance the end product's workability, setting time, strength, or durability.
