The ratio of aggregate (sand and gravel) to cement is crucial to the durability of the final product. Stronger concrete may be achieved with a lower aggregate-to-cement ratio, since a greater ratio reduces the amount of cement used to bind the aggregate together. Stronger concrete is possible with a higher cement-to-aggregate ratio because more cement is used to bond the aggregate together. The strength of concrete is also significantly affected by the curing conditions. To ensure the cement hydrates correctly and the concrete hardens properly, curing the concrete the right way involves keeping it wet and at a steady temperature. Weak concrete, owing to partial hydration or cracking, may result from improper curing. Strength of concrete also depends on how it is mixed, laid, and compacted. Void formation, segregation, and bleeding are all signs of improper mixing, placing, and compaction, all of which may weaken the final product. Admixtures are chemical ingredients that are added to the concrete mixture to enhance or alter its qualities. They may make the finished product easier to work with, take less time to set, be stronger, or last longer.
