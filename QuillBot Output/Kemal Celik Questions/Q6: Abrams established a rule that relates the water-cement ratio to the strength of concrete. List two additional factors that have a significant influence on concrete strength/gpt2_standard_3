Ratio of aggregate to cement: The strength of concrete is significantly influenced by the ratio of aggregate (sand and gravel) to cement. Because there is less cement to hold the aggregate together when the aggregate to cement ratio is greater, the concrete may be weaker. If there is more cement to bind the aggregate together due to a lower aggregate to cement ratio, the concrete may be stronger. Curing circumstances: The concrete's strength is significantly impacted by the curing circumstances. In order to guarantee that the cement hydrates correctly, which may lead to stronger concrete, appropriate curing, which is the process of keeping the concrete wet and at a constant temperature, is necessary. Inadequate curing may cause cracking or partial hydration, which can make concrete weaker. Concrete placing and mixing have an effect on the concrete's strength, as do the placement and compacting techniques used. Inadequate mixing, placing, and compaction might result in voids, segregation, or bleeding, which can compromise the final product's strength. Chemical substances known as additives are added to the concrete mixture to change or enhance the qualities. They may increase the end product's workability, set time, strength, or durability.
