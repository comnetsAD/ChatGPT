Abrams discovered that the water-cement ratio greatly affected the durability of concrete. The strength of concrete is affected by many different things, some of which are: Percentage of aggregate in cement: The strength of concrete depends in large part on the proportion of sand, gravel, or other aggregate to cement used in the mix. Since the aggregate is what gives concrete its strength and stability, increasing the aggregate-to-cement ratio usually results in stronger concrete. Condition curing: Concrete's strength and durability greatly depend on how well it cures. Curing is the process of controlling the humidity and temperature of a substance while it dries out. Stronger concrete is the consequence of curing conditions that are optimal for the material, such as maintaining a constant moisture level and temperature. In conclusion, concrete strength is affected not only by the water-cement ratio but also by the aggregate-to-cement ratio and curing circumstances.
