The following are two more elements that have a substantial impact on concrete strength: Size and form of aggregates: The aggregate (stones or gravel) size and form used in the concrete mix may have a considerable impact on the strength of the concrete. Larger aggregate particles produce stronger concrete, whereas smaller aggregate particles produce weaker concrete. Similarly, larger angular aggregate particles produce stronger concrete than rounder ones. Curing: Concrete curing is critical for the development of its strength. Curing is the process of keeping the concrete wet and at a correct temperature after it has been laid for a length of time to enable the hydration process to continue and the concrete to build strength. Concrete will not reach its maximum strength potential if it is not properly cured. It is worth noting that the Water-Cement ratio (W/C) is one of the most important factors influencing the strength and durability of concrete, but other factors such as curing conditions, aggregate type, gradation, and mineralogy, air content, temperature, and humidity can all have a significant impact on the final strength of the concrete.
