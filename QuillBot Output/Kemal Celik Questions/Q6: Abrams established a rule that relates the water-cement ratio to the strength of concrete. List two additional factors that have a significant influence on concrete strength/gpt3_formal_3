Two other parameters that significantly affect the strength of concrete are: The aggregate size and form: The size and form of the aggregate (stones or gravel) used in the concrete mixture may have a substantial impact on the concrete's strength. Typically, larger aggregate particles will result in a concrete that is stronger, while smaller particles will result in a concrete that is weaker. Similarly, concrete with angular aggregate particles will be stronger than concrete with rounded aggregate particles. Curing: Proper curing of concrete is essential for its strength development. Curing is the act of keeping concrete wet and at an appropriate temperature for a length of time after placement so that the hydration process may continue and the concrete can build strength. If concrete is not adequately cured, it will not attain its maximum strength. Notably, the Water-Cement Ratio (W/C) is one of the most important factors affecting the strength and durability of concrete, but other factors such as curing conditions, aggregate type, gradation, and mineralogy, air content, temperature, and humidity can also have a significant impact on the final strength of concrete.
