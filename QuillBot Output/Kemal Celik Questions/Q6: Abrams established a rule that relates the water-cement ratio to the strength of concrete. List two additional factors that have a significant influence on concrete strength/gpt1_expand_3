Abrams discovered that the proportion of water to cement in concrete was a significant element in determining the strength of the concrete. However, the strength of concrete is also significantly affected by a number of other elements, including the following: Aggregate-to-cement ratio: The ratio of aggregate (which might include sand, gravel, and other similar materials) to cement in the concrete mix is another important factor that helps determine the strength of the concrete. Because aggregate contributes strength and stability to the mix, a larger ratio of aggregate to cement often results in concrete with increased compressive strength. Conditions that may be cured: Concrete must be properly cured in order for it to develop its full potential in terms of strength and durability. During the process of hardening, the term "curing" refers to the act of ensuring that a certain amount of moisture and temperature are maintained. A more favorable environment for curing the concrete, including maintaining the concrete at an appropriate temperature and level of moisture, will provide concrete that is of a higher strength. In conclusion, the ratio of aggregates to cement as well as the curing conditions are two more parameters that have a considerable impact on the strength of concrete. The ratio of water to cement is the first of these three factors.
