There are two other elements that have a major impact on concrete's strength: Scale and form of the whole: The strength of concrete may be greatly impacted by the size and form of the aggregate (stones or gravel) used in the mix. Concrete with larger aggregate particles is often stronger than concrete with smaller aggregate particles. Equally, concrete with aggregates that are more angular than rounded will have more strength. Curing: When concrete is cured properly, its strength fully develops. In order to continue the hydration process and enable the concrete to build strength, it must be kept wet and at an appropriate temperature for a certain amount of time after it has been poured. This is known as "curing." Inadequate curing prevents concrete from reaching its full strength. Not only does the Water-Cement ratio (W/C) play a major role in determining the ultimate strength and durability of concrete, but other elements like as curing conditions, aggregate type, gradation, mineralogy, air content, temperature, and humidity may also have a major impact.
