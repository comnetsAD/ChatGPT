The microstructure and strength of concrete will change as aggregate sizes rise. Cement paste and particles form concrete's microstructure. Larger aggregate particles provide a coarser microstructure with broader particle spacing. This reduces the aggregates' surface area in contact with the cement paste, reducing bonding. This weakens concrete. Larger aggregate particles may not be thoroughly covered with cement paste, increasing concrete porosity. This increases water penetration and freeze-thaw cycles. However, big aggregate particles may strengthen concrete. Larger aggregate particles are less prone to migrate or settle, making concrete more solid. They also support cement paste better, increasing compressive strength. An increase in aggregate maximum size will affect concrete strength depending on mix design and aggregate particle qualities. To enhance concrete strength and longevity, examine the pros and downsides of bigger aggregate particles.
