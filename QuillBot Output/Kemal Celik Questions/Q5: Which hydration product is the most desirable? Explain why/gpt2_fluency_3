Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H) is the most desired hydration product in cement, created by the interaction of calcium oxide (CaO) and silica (SiO2) in cement with water. C-S-H is the primary binder in concrete and the primary contributor to its strength and durability. C-S-H has many excellent qualities that make it the most ideal cement hydration product: C-S-H produces strong connections between cement particles, giving concrete its great compressive strength. Low porosity: Because C-S-H produces a thick structure, concrete is less permeable to liquids and gases. This protects the steel reinforcement from corrosion and boosts the concrete's longevity. Low shrinkage: Because C-S-H has a low coefficient of thermal expansion, it does not shrink or expand much when subjected to temperature variations. This helps to keep the concrete from breaking. Low alkali-silica reactivity: Because C-S-H is not reactive with the alkalis in the cement and silica in the aggregates, it does not induce expansion or breaking in the concrete. Low carbonation: Because C-S-H is not reactive with carbon dioxide, it does not promote internal corrosion of steel reinforcement. In conclusion, C-S-H is the most desired hydration product in cement since it is the primary binder in concrete and the primary contributor to its strength and durability. It is the most preferred hydration product due to its favorable qualities such as high strength, low porosity, low shrinkage, low alkali-silica reactivity, and low carbonation.
