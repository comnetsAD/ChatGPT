After reacting with water, the calcium oxide (CaO) and silica (SiO2) in cement produce Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H), the most desired hydration product in cement. The three-letter chemical compound C-S-H is the primary binder in concrete and a major reason for the material's strength and longevity. Among the many possible hydration products for cement, C-S-H is by far the most preferable due to its many beneficial qualities. Compressive strength is great because CSH links the cement particles together strongly. Concrete has a low permeability to liquids and gases because its C-S-H structure is dense. To prevent corrosion of the steel reinforcement, this helps to make the concrete last longer. C-S-H exhibits little contraction or expansion in response to variations in temperature because of its low coefficient of thermal expansion. So concrete doesn't break, this is a good thing to do. Since CSH is not reactive with the alkalis in cement and the silica in aggregates, it does not produce expansion or cracking in the concrete, as is the case with alkali-silica-reactive cements. Because C-S-H is inert toward carbon dioxide, the steel reinforcement is protected from carbonation-related internal corrosion. Concrete's primary binder and primary contributor to its strength and durability, cement's C-S-H hydration product is the most ideal hydration product. It is the most preferred hydration product because of its many favorable qualities, including its high strength, low porosity, low shrinkage, low alkali-silica reactivity, and low carbonation.
