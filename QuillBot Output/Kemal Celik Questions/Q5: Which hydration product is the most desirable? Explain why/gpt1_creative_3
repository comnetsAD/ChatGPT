Calcium silicate hydrate is the most desired hydration product in the manufacturing of Portland cement (C-S-H). C-S-H is the primary hydration product that develops when water and cement are combined. It is a gel-like substance that fills and binds the spaces between cement particles. This is what provides strength and durability to concrete. The reaction between the calcium ions in the cement and the silica and alumina in the aggregates produces C-S-H. C-S-H is attractive because it has many critical qualities for concrete: C-S-H has a high compressive strength, which is the concrete's capacity to withstand crushing pressures. This makes it a suitable construction material for bridges, buildings, and highways. Low porosity: Because C-S-H has a low porosity, it is relatively impervious to water. This renders the concrete resistant to weathering, erosion, and chemical assault, therefore extending its lifespan. High durability: C-S-H has a high durability, which means it can survive the stresses and strains of daily usage for an extended duration. C-S-H has a low thermal expansion, which indicates that it does not expand or contract much with variations in temperature. This prevents concrete from breaking due to temperature variations. C-S-H has minimal shrinkage, which means it does not shrink much as it dries. This helps prevent concrete from breaking while it dries. C-S-H is the most desired hydration product in the manufacturing of Portland cement because it contributes to the strength, durability, and performance of concrete via a variety of critical features.
