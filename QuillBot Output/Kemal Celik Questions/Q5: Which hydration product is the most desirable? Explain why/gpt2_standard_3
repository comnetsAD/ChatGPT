Calcium Silicate Hydrate (C-S-H), which is created when calcium oxide (CaO) and silica (SiO2) in cement react with water, is the most desired hydration product in cement. The primary component of concrete's strength and durability is its principal binder, C-S-H. C-S-H is the preferred hydration product in cement due to a variety of favorable characteristics: Strong linkages between cement particles are created by C-S-H, giving concrete its great compressive strength. Low porosity: C-S-H creates a dense structure, reducing the permeability of concrete to liquids and gases. This makes the concrete more durable and aids in preventing corrosion of the steel reinforcement. Low shrinkage: C-S-H does not shrink or expand much when subjected to temperature fluctuations since it has a low coefficient of thermal expansion. This aids in preventing concrete cracking. Low alkali-silica reactivity: Because C-S-H does not react with the alkalis in the cement and the silica in the aggregates, it has a low alkali-silica reactivity and does not induce expansion or breaking in the concrete. Low carbonation: Because C-S-H does not react with carbon dioxide, it does not carbonate, which prevents interior corrosion of the steel reinforcement. As a result of being the primary binder in concrete and the primary factor in the strength and durability of concrete, C-S-H is the most desired hydration product in cement. It is the most ideal hydration product because to its high strength, low porosity, low shrinkage, low alkali-silica reactivity, and low carbonation levels.
