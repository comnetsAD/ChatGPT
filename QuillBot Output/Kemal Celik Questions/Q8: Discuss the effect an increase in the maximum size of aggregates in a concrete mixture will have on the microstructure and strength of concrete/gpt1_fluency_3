The maximum size of particles in a concrete mixture has a major impact on the microstructure and strength of the concrete. Among the most significant consequences are: Microstructure: As the maximum size of aggregates increases, the number of aggregate particles per unit volume of concrete decreases. This will produce a coarser microstructure with fewer voids and more visible big aggregate particles. Porosity: As the maximum size of aggregates increases, porosity decreases. This is because bigger aggregate particles have less surface area than smaller aggregate particles, requiring less water to fill the spaces between them. Compressive strength: As the maximum size of aggregates increases, so does its compressive strength. This is because bigger aggregate particles can withstand compressive pressures better than smaller aggregate particles, resulting in stronger concrete. Flexural strength: As the maximum size of aggregates increases, flexural strength decreases. This is because bigger aggregate particles are more brittle than smaller particles and can't survive the tensile strains that form in concrete when it bends. Thermal conductivity: As the maximum size of aggregate increases, so does the thermal conductivity of concrete. This is because larger aggregate particles have better thermal conductivity than smaller aggregate particles and hence transfer heat quicker. Shrinkage: As the maximum size of aggregate increases, so will the shrinkage of concrete. This is due to the fact that larger aggregate particles have less surface area than smaller aggregate particles and hence need less water to fill the spaces between them, resulting in a fall in the water to cement ratio and a rise in shrinkage. To summarize, increasing the maximum size of aggregates in a concrete mixture results in a coarser microstructure with fewer voids and more visible large aggregate particles, a decrease in porosity, an increase in compressive strength, a decrease in flexural strength, an increase in thermal conductivity, and an increase in shrinkage. It is crucial to note that the influence of aggregate maximum size on concrete strength and microstructure is largely reliant on the particular mix design as well as the kind and qualities of the aggregates used. For example, if the aggregate is weaker than the cement paste, although having bigger aggregate particles, the total strength may suffer. When determining the maximum size of aggregate to be used in a concrete mixture, it is essential to carefully analyze the qualities of the aggregates as well as the particular needs of the project.
