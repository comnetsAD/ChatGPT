Concrete's microstructure and strength will change if the maximum size of particles used is increased. The concrete microstructure is the internal structure of the material, including the distribution of the cement paste and particles. The aggregate's microstructure will get coarser as the particles become larger. Due to a decrease in aggregate surface area exposed to the cement paste, bonding between the aggregate and paste may suffer. A weaker concrete may result from this. Furthermore, bigger aggregate particles might cause more porosity in the concrete because the larger particles could not be completely covered with cement paste. This makes the area more susceptible to water damage and the effects of freezing and thawing. However, big aggregate particles may increase the durability of the final product. Larger aggregate particles are less prone to migrate or settle over time, creating a more solid framework for the concrete. They may also help the cement paste harden, which can increase the material's compressive strength. Whether or not a larger maximum aggregate size improves concrete's overall strength is conditional on the mix's design and the aggregate particles' characteristics. Optimizing the strength and durability of the concrete necessitates giving thought to the trade-offs between using bigger aggregate particles and using smaller ones.
