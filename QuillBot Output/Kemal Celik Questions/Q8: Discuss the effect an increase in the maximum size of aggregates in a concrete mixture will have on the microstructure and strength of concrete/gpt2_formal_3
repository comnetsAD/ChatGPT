The microstructure and strength of concrete will be affected by an increase in the maximum aggregate size. Concrete's microstructure is the arrangement of cement paste and particles inside the material. Larger aggregate particles will result in a coarser microstructure with more interparticle spacing. This may lead to a decrease in the aggregate surface area in contact with the cement paste, hence reducing the bonding between the aggregate and paste. This might result in concrete that is weaker. In addition, bigger aggregate particles may not be completely covered with cement paste, resulting in greater porosity in the concrete. This may result in increased water infiltration and sensitivity to freeze-thaw cycles. Large aggregate particles, on the other hand, may increase the strength of concrete. Larger aggregate particles may provide a more stable concrete construction because they are less prone to shift or settle over time. In addition, they may offer better support for the cement paste, resulting in increased compressive strength. The impact of an increase in the maximum size of aggregates on the overall strength of concrete will depend on the particular mix design and the aggregate particle characteristics. In order to improve the strength and durability of concrete, it is vital to assess the balance between the possible advantages and downsides of bigger aggregate particles.
