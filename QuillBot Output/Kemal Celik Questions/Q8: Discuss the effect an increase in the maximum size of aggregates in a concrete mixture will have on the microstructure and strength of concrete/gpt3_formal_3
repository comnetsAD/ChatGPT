A concrete mixture's microstructure will typically become more coarse if the maximum size of the particles is increased. Compared to smaller aggregate particles, bigger aggregate particles will be less dense and more widely distributed. The qualities of the concrete may be impacted in a variety of ways, including: a decrease in the concrete's strength. The strength of concrete is significantly influenced by the strength and quantity of the binding between the aggregate particles and the cement paste. Larger aggregate particles provide a coarser microstructure that has less surface area for the cement paste to adhere to, weakening the concrete. an increase in the concrete's porosity. More voids in the concrete will result from larger aggregate particles, which may result in more water and air being trapped in the microstructure. The overall strength and longevity of the concrete may suffer as a result. an increase in the concrete's permeability. Greater aggregate particles will also produce larger spaces in the concrete, which will make it easier for liquids to flow through and weaken its resistance to chemical and water assault. a decline in the concrete's capacity to be worked. Larger aggregate particles will make placing and compacting the concrete more challenging and may make it more difficult to obtain the ideal final form and quality. It is typically not advised to increase the maximum size of aggregates in concrete mixtures since doing so is likely to have a detrimental effect on the concrete's microstructure and strength.
