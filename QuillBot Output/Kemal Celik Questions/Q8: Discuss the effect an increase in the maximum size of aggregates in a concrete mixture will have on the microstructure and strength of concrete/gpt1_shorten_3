The microstructure and strength of concrete will be greatly affected by increasing the maximum aggregate size. Effects: Microstructure: An increase in aggregate maximum size will reduce aggregate particles per unit volume of concrete. The coarser microstructure will have fewer vacancies and more big aggregate particles. Porosity: Aggregate maximum size decreases porosity. Larger aggregate particles need less water to fill their holes since they have less surface area. Compressive strength increases with aggregate maximum size. Larger aggregate particles withstand compressive pressures better than smaller ones, making concrete stronger. Flexural strength: Aggregate maximum size decreases flexural strength. Larger aggregate particles are more brittle and cannot survive concrete's tensile stresses during bending. Thermal conductivity: Concrete's thermal conductivity increases with aggregate maximum size. Large aggregate particles have stronger thermal conductivity than smaller ones and transfer heat quicker. Concrete shrinkage increases with aggregate maximum size. Large aggregate particles have less surface area than smaller particles, thus they need less water to fill the spaces between them, decreasing the water to cement ratio and increasing shrinkage. In summary, increasing the maximum aggregate size in a concrete mixture will result in a coarser microstructure with fewer voids and more large aggregate particles visible, a decrease in porosity, an increase in compressive strength, a decrease in flexural strength, an increase in thermal conductivity, and an increase in shrinkage. The maximum aggregate size's influence on concrete's strength and microstructure depends on the mix design and aggregate type and qualities. Despite having bigger aggregate particles, if the aggregate is weaker than the cement paste, it may reduce strength. Thus, determining the maximum aggregate size for a concrete mixture requires careful consideration of aggregate qualities and project requirements.
