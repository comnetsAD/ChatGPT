In most cases, a coarser concrete microstructure may be achieved by increasing the maximum size of particles in the concrete mix. This is due to the fact that aggregates with bigger particles will be more sparsely packed than those with smaller particles. As a result, this may alter the concrete in a variety of ways, such as: Weakening of the concrete's structural integrity. Concrete's durability is determined in large part by the strength of the connection formed between the cement paste and the aggregate particles. Larger aggregate particles provide a coarser microstructure, which reduces the surface area available for cement paste to link to and ultimately weakens the concrete. A rise in the concrete's permeability. More water and air may be trapped in the concrete's microstructure if the aggregate particles are bigger. As a result, the concrete may become weaker and less durable. The concrete's permeability has improved. Water and other liquids will be able to travel through the concrete more readily if the aggregate particles are bigger, which may diminish the concrete's resistance to water and chemical assault. Its workability has decreased. When working with concrete, larger aggregate particles might make it more challenging to obtain the required final form and finish via proper placement and compacting. In general, it is not advised to increase the maximum size of particles in a concrete mixture since it might compromise the concrete's microstructure and strength.
