The microstructure and strength of concrete will be drastically altered if the maximum aggregate size is increased. The most notable outcomes include: Increasing the maximum aggregate size reduces the number of aggregate particles per unit volume of concrete, which affects the microstructure of the material. There will be fewer spaces and more obvious big aggregate particles as a consequence of this, indicating a coarser microstructure. Reduced porosity occurs when aggregates are allowed to grow to their greatest possible size. This is because less water is needed to fill the spaces between bigger aggregate particles than smaller ones since the larger particles have a lower surface area. When the maximum aggregate size is increased, the compressive strength also rises. This is due to the fact that concrete with bigger aggregate particles can better withstand compressive pressures than that with smaller particles. There will be a reduction in flexural strength if the maximum size of aggregates is increased. This is due to the fact that bigger aggregate particles are more brittle than smaller particles and cannot survive the tensile stresses that form in concrete during bending. Concrete's heat conductivity improves as the maximum aggregate size is increased. Compared to smaller particles, the big aggregate particles will have a greater thermal conductivity and will transmit heat more quickly. Concrete shrinkage occurs when the aggregate used is less than the specified maximum size. This is due to the fact that the water to cement ratio decreases and the shrinkage increases because bigger aggregate particles have a lower surface area and so need less water to fill the spaces between them. In conclusion, a coarser microstructure (fewer voids and more large aggregate particles visible), lower porosity, higher compressive strength, lower flexural strength, higher thermal conductivity, and higher shrinkage can be achieved by increasing the maximum size of aggregates in a concrete mixture. It's crucial to remember that the aggregate type, characteristics, and mix design all have a role in how much of an impact the maximum aggregate size has on concrete's strength and microstructure. If, for any reason, the aggregate is less strong than the cement paste, then the aggregate's bigger size may not compensate for the total weakness. Because of this, determining the maximum size of aggregate to be utilized in a concrete mixture requires careful consideration of the qualities of the aggregates and the particular needs of the project.
