The microstructure and strength of concrete will be significantly altered by an increase in the maximum aggregate size. Among the principal impacts are: The number of aggregate particles per unit volume of concrete decreases as the maximum size of aggregates increases. This will produce a microstructure with fewer voids and more visible big aggregate particles. A rise in the maximum size of aggregates will result in a reduction in porosity. This is due to the fact that bigger aggregate particles have less surface area than smaller particles, requiring less water to fill the spaces between them. Compressive strength: An increase in the aggregates' maximum size will result in an increase in compressive strength. Because bigger aggregate particles can withstand compressive pressures better than smaller ones, the concrete will be stronger with larger aggregate particles. Flexural strength: An increase in the aggregates' maximum size will reduce flexural strength. This is because bigger aggregate particles are more brittle and less able to sustain the tensile stresses that form in concrete during bending. Thermal conductivity: a larger maximum aggregate size will enhance the thermal conductivity of concrete. Large aggregate particles will have a better thermal conductivity than smaller particles and will thus transfer heat more quickly. An increase in the maximum size of aggregate will result in an increase in concrete shrinkage. Large aggregate particles have less surface area than smaller particles and hence need less water to fill the spaces between them, resulting in a lower water-to-cement ratio and an increase in shrinkage. An increase in the maximum size of aggregates in a concrete mixture will result in a coarser microstructure with fewer voids and more visible large aggregate particles, a reduction in porosity, an increase in compressive strength, a decrease in flexural strength, an increase in thermal conductivity, and an increase in shrinkage. It is vital to note that the influence of aggregate maximum size on the strength and microstructure of concrete is largely dependent on the mix design, aggregate type, and aggregate qualities. For instance, if the aggregate is weaker than the cement paste, it may result in a drop in total strength despite the aggregate particles being bigger. When determining the maximum size of aggregate to be used in a concrete mixture, it is crucial to take into account the qualities of the aggregates and the particular needs of the project.
