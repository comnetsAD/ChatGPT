Increases in the maximum aggregate size in a concrete mixture will affect the microstructure and strength of the concrete. The microstructure of concrete refers to how the cement paste and particles are arranged inside the concrete. Larger aggregate particles result in a coarser microstructure with greater particle spacing. This might result in a decrease in the total surface area of the aggregates in contact with the cement paste, resulting in less bonding between the aggregate and the paste. This may result in weakened concrete. Furthermore, bigger aggregate particles may not be thoroughly covered with cement paste, resulting in greater porosity in the concrete. This may result in increased water penetration and sensitivity to freeze-thaw cycles. Large aggregate particles, on the other hand, may improve the strength of concrete. Larger aggregate particles, which are less prone to migrate or settle over time, may offer a more solid framework for the concrete. They may also offer better support for the cement paste, resulting in higher compressive strength. The overall impact of increasing the maximum size of aggregates on concrete strength will be determined by the particular mix design and the aggregate particle characteristics. In general, in order to improve the strength and durability of the concrete, it is essential to weigh the possible advantages and downsides of bigger aggregate particles.
