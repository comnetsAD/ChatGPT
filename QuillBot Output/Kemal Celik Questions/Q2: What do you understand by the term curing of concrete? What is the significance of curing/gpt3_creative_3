Newly laid concrete must be "cured," or kept at a constant temperature and moisture level, until it achieves the necessary strength. The concrete's characteristics and longevity can only fully emerge during the curing phase. In order to maintain the chemical reactions that occur during the hydration process after concrete has been put and completed, it must be maintained wet. Calcium silicate hydrate (CSH), a byproduct of these processes, is what gives concrete its strength and durability. The development of CSH is impeded, and the concrete's strength is reduced, if the concrete dries out at any point throughout this process. Concrete may be cured in a variety of ways, including via ponding, misting, coating with curing agents or wet burlap, or utilizing a curing membrane. Most concrete is cured by applying water in one of three ways: ponding, misting, or spraying. Curing concrete is important because it helps the material attain its full potential for strength and durability. With proper curing, concrete becomes less porous to water and other liquids, increasing its resistance to freeze-thaw cycles, chemical assault, and abrasion. Curing also aids in avoiding concrete flaws like cracks, scaling, and blemishes on the surface. In conclusion, curing concrete is crucial because it makes the material more impervious to water and other liquids, which increases its resistance to freeze-thaw cycles, chemical assault, and wear.
