Curing allows concrete to hydrate and attain its intended strength by maintaining an appropriate moisture and temperature level. Hydration—which hardens and strengthens concrete—requires water. Lack of water will slow the hydration process and prevent the concrete from reaching its maximum strength. However, too much water in the concrete will evaporate, causing cracking, shrinkage, and a weaker result. Curing slows water evaporation from the concrete surface, maintaining its moisture level. Using a curing agent, a curing membrane, or water may achieve this. Curing ensures that the concrete achieves its intended strength for durability, utility, and safety. It also prevents cracking, shrinkage, and other surface flaws from premature concrete drying. Curing increases durability and chemical and freeze-thaw resistance. In conclusion, curing is essential to concrete's strength and endurance. It also resists freeze-thaw cycles, chemical assault, cracking, shrinkage, and other surface flaws.
