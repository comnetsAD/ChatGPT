In the manufacturing of Portland cement, gypsum is added to the clinker grains for two primary reasons. Gypsum is added to the clinker in order to regulate the pace at which the cement sets. Calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO42H2O), the chemical constituent of gypsum, combines with tricalcium aluminate (C3A) in the clinker to generate calcium sulfoaluminate hydrate (C4AH13), which reduces the pace at which the cement sets. This ensures that the cement has sufficient time to be carried, put, and completed prior to setting. When cement is hydrated, heat is produced, which may cause concrete to expand and break at an early age. The addition of gypsum to clinker controls this expansion and prevents cracking. It does this by interacting with the C3A in the clinker to produce C4AH13, which has a lower hydration rate and produces less heat. This reduces the likelihood of concrete breaking at an early age. In addition, gypsum prevents flash setting, a phenomena that occurs when a cement sets too rapidly owing to a high C3A component. During the manufacturing of Portland cement, gypsum is added to the clinker grains to regulate the setting time, minimize early-age cracking in concrete, and prevent the cement from setting too quickly. It is a fundamental component in the manufacturing of Portland cement, and its exact management is necessary for the manufacture of high-quality, consistent cement products. Typically, the quantity of gypsum added to the clinker is between 3 and 5 percent of the clinker's total weight, and it is added during the last stages of the cement grinding process. The particular quantity of gypsum used depends on the kind of cement being manufactured and the desired qualities of the finished product.
