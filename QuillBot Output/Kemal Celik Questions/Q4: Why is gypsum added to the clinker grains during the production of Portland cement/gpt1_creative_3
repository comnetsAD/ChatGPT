There are a few reasons why gypsum is mixed together with clinker to make Portland cement: The setting time may be controlled by adding gypsum, which works as a setting retarder and slows the cement's curing period. This facilitates the placement and finishing of the concrete and slows its setting time, reducing the likelihood of cracking. By controlling the hydration rate, gypsum serves to minimize the cement's heat of hydration and protect against cracking caused by sudden temperature shifts. So that it is easier to deal with the concrete: With the addition of gypsum, the concrete becomes more malleable and manageable, allowing for more efficient construction. With gypsum, the concrete's quality is enhanced, resulting in a more polished appearance with less need for extra finishing steps. When exposed to water, the minerals in clinker generate various compounds, including ettringite, which may lead to an expansion of the cement paste and, eventually, breaking. Gypsum added to cement helps reduce ettringite development, which leads to less swelling and less cracking. It's important to note that during the manufacturing of Portland cement, only a little quantity of gypsum, generally between 3-5% by weight of the clinker, is added.
