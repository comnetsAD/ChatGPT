During the manufacturing process of Portland cement, gypsum is mixed in with the clinker for a number of reasons: Gypsum is used as a setting retarder, which means it slows down the rate at which cement sets. This allows the setting time to be regulated. This makes it easier to put the concrete and finish it, and it also helps to minimize cracks that may be caused by the concrete setting too quickly. Gypsum also slows down the pace of hydration of the cement, which helps to minimize the heat of hydration and avoid cracking due to abrupt temperature fluctuations. In order to manage the rate of hydration: Gypsum also helps to control the rate of hydration. For the purpose of making the concrete easier to deal with: The use of gypsum enhances the workability of the concrete by rendering it more flexible and making it less difficult to manipulate. Gypsum also enhances the quality of the concrete by providing it a smoother surface and decreasing the need for extra finishing work. This helps to reduce the overall amount of finishing work that has to be done. In the presence of water, the clinker minerals produce a variety of compounds, one of which is ettringite. Ettringite is responsible for the expansion of the cement paste, which may lead to cracking if it is not controlled. Ettringite expansion can be controlled by adding water to the mixture. The incorporation of gypsum into the cement will assist in the regulation of the development of ettringite, which will result in the prevention of cracking and expansion. It is important to note that during the manufacturing of Portland cement, only a very little quantity of gypsum is added to the clinker. This amount is normally between 3 and 5% of the total weight of the clinker.
