During the manufacturing of Portland cement, gypsum is added to the clinker grains for many reasons. As a setting regulator, gypsum slows down the setting time of the cement mixture. This provides for more time to put and complete the concrete, which is essential for huge projects like as bridges and skyscrapers. Control the rate of hydration: Gypsum also aids in controlling the rate of hydration, which is the cement's process of hardening and gaining strength over time. This is necessary to guarantee that the concrete hardens uniformly and does not fracture or deteriorate early. Gypsum also controls the heat of hydration, which is the heat produced by the chemical interactions between cement and water. This is necessary to avoid cracking or structural damage during the curing process. Gypsum also increases the cement's workability, making it simpler to mix, lay, and finish. This is essential for huge projects requiring a high degree of accuracy and consistency. Gypsum contributes to the improvement of the finished product by increasing its durability and resistance to weathering, erosion, and chemical assault. The addition of gypsum to the clinker grains during the manufacture of Portland cement is a crucial step in ensuring that the finished product is strong, long-lasting, and of uniform quality.
