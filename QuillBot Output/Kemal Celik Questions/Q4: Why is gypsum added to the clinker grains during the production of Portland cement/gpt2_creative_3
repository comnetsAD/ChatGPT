There are two primary motivations for adding gypsum to the clinker grains in the Portland cement manufacturing process: Gypsum is added to the clinker to modify the setting time of the cement. Gypsum's calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO42H2O) combines with the tricalcium aluminate (C3A) in the clinker to generate calcium sulfoaluminate hydrate (C4AH13), which reduces the cement's setting time. This ensures the cement may be moved, put, and completed before it sets. When cement is hydrated, heat is produced, which may lead to expansion and cracking in the concrete. To prevent the clinker from splitting because to its rapid growth, gypsum is often added to the mix. The C3A in the clinker is reacted with this substance to produce C4AH13, which hydrates at a slower pace and so produces less heat. This aids in lowering the probability of concrete breaking at a young age. The phenomena of flash setting, in which a cement sets too rapidly owing to a high amount of C3A, is mitigated by the addition of gypsum to the mixing process. In order to minimize flash setting and early-age cracking in concrete, gypsum is added to the clinker grains during the manufacturing of Portland cement. It's a crucial component in making Portland cement, so keeping it under tight control is crucial to making cement that lasts and that looks the same every time. In the latter steps of the cement grinding process, gypsum is added to the clinker, normally at a concentration of 3-5% by weight. The specific quantity of gypsum used varies with the cement type being manufactured and the desired qualities of the finished product.
