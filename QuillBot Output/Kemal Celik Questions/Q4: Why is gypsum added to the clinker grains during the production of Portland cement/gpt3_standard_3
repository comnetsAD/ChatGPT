For a number of reasons, gypsum is added to the clinker grains while making Portland cement: Gypsum functions as a setting regulator, slowing the time it takes for the cement mixture to set. This gives the concrete more time to set up and harden, which is crucial for big projects like bridges and skyscrapers. Control the rate of hydration: Gypsum also aids in regulating the cement's rate of hydration, which is the process through which the cement gradually becomes harder and stronger. This is crucial to make sure that the concrete hardens steadily and does not prematurely fracture or weaken. Control of the heat of hydration: Gypsum also lowers the heat produced by the chemical processes taking place between the water and the cement during hydration. This is necessary to avoid structural damage or cracking while the material is curing. Enhance workability: Gypsum also makes cement more easily mixable, installable, and finished. This is crucial for significant projects that need a high level of consistency and accuracy. Gypsum also contributes to the improvement of the finished product by enhancing its durability and chemical, erosive, and weather resistance. Overall, adding gypsum to the clinker grains while making Portland cement is a crucial stage in the production process to guarantee that the end product is robust, long-lasting, and of high quality.
