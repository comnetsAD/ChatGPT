During the manufacturing of Portland cement, gypsum is added to clinker for many reasons. To control the setting time, gypsum functions as a setting retarder, delaying the cement's setting time. This facilitates the placement and finishing of the concrete and prevents cracks caused by its quick setting. In order to manage the pace of hydration, gypsum reduces the rate of hydration of cement, hence reducing the heat of hydration and preventing cracking caused by fast temperature fluctuations. To enhance the workability of concrete, one must: The inclusion of gypsum enhances the workability of the concrete by making it more flexible and manageable. Gypsum also enhances the finish of concrete, making the surface smoother and decreasing the need for extra finishing work. In the presence of water, clinker minerals generate several compounds, one of which is ettringite, which may induce an expansion of the cement paste that can lead to cracking. The addition of gypsum to cement will assist prevent expansion and cracking by preventing the production of ettringite. It is important to note that the quantity of gypsum added to the clinker during the manufacturing of Portland cement is normally minimal, between 3 and 5 percent by weight of the clinker.
