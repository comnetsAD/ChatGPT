For a number of reasons, gypsum is added to clinker for making Portland cement: Gypsum works as a setting retarder, slowing down the cement's setting time, to control the setting time. This makes it easier to pour and finish the concrete and reduces the chance of breaking from quick setting. Gypsum also slows down the cement's rate of hydration, which serves to lower the heat of hydration and minimize cracking brought on by abrupt temperature fluctuations. To make the concrete more easily manipulated: Gypsum enhances the concrete's capacity to be worked, making it more flexible and manageable. To enhance the concrete's finish: Gypsum also makes the concrete's finish better by providing it a smoother surface and minimizing the need for extra finishing work. Ettringite, one of the compounds formed by clinker minerals in the presence of water, may cause the cement paste to expand and fracture. In order to prevent this from happening, restrict the development of ettringite. Gypsum will be added to the cement to assist limit the growth of ettringite and so stop it from expanding and breaking. It's important to remember that just a tiny quantity of gypsum—generally between 3-5% of the clinker's weight—is routinely used while making Portland cement.
