For two major purposes, gypsum is added to the clinker grains while making Portland cement: Gypsum is included into the clinker to regulate the pace at which the cement sets. When calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO42H2O), a chemical component of gypsum, is added to clinker, it combines with the tricalcium aluminate (C3A) to create calcium sulfoaluminate hydrate (C4AH13), which slows down the cement's setting time. By doing so, it is possible to make sure that the cement will have enough time to be delivered, installed, and completed before it begins to harden. Control of early-age cracking: Heat is produced during cement hydration, which may lead to the expansion and cracking of the concrete. To limit this growth and avoid cracking, gypsum is added to the cement clinker. This is accomplished by combining with the C3A in the clinker to create C4AH13, which hydrates at a slower pace and produces less heat as a result. This lessens the chance of the concrete developing early-age cracks. Gypsum also aids in preventing flash setting, a condition in which a cement sets too rapidly because of a high C3A component. In conclusion, gypsum is added to the clinker grains during the manufacturing of Portland cement to regulate the setting time, stop concrete from breaking at an early age, and stop the cement from flash setting. It is a crucial component in the creation of Portland cement, and careful control over it is necessary to create cement products that are consistently high-quality. In the last stages of the cement grinding process, gypsum is normally added to the clinker in a quantity equal to 3-5% of the total weight of the clinker. Depending on the kind of cement being made and the required qualities of the finished product, a different quantity of gypsum may be added.
