In order to produce Portland cement, gypsum is mixed in with the clinker grains. Gypsum functions as a setting regulator, reducing the cement's initial hardening time. Gypsum also aids in regulating the cement's hydration, or the process by which it dries and becomes harder and stronger over time. This is crucial for preventing early cracking and brittleness in the concrete and ensuring a uniform hardening time. Gypsum also helps regulate the heat of hydration, or the amount of heat produced by the chemical interactions between the cement and water. This is crucial in avoiding any structural damage or cracking when the material cures. A high level of accuracy and uniformity is essential for such massive undertakings. Increase the longevity and resistance to weathering, erosion, and chemical assault of the finished product by using gypsum.
