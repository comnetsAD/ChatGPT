Gypsum is added to the clinker grains during the Portland cement manufacturing process for two reasons: Setting time control: Gypsum is added to the clinker to regulate the pace at which the cement sets. When calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO42H2O) is added to clinker, it combines with the tricalcium aluminate (C3A) in the clinker to generate calcium sulfoaluminate hydrate (C4AH13), slowing the pace at which the cement sets. This ensures that the cement has enough time to be delivered, put, and completed before hardening. Control of early-age cracking: When cement is hydrated, heat is produced, causing the concrete to expand and fracture. To limit this expansion and avoid cracking, gypsum is added to the clinker. This is accomplished by interacting with the C3A in the clinker to make C4AH13, which has a lower rate of hydration and so produces less heat. This reduces the possibility of early-age cracking in the concrete. Furthermore, gypsum aids in the prevention of flash setting, which occurs when a cement sets too rapidly owing to a high C3A component. To summarize, gypsum is added to the clinker grains throughout the Portland cement manufacturing process to manage the setting time and avoid early-age cracking in concrete, as well as to prevent flash setting of the cement. It is a critical component in the manufacturing of Portland cement, and perfect management is required to produce high-quality, consistent cement products. Gypsum is normally added to clinker at a rate of 3-5% of the total weight of the clinker, and it is added in the last stages of the cement grinding process. The actual quantity of gypsum injected might vary based on the kind of cement produced and the intended final product qualities.
