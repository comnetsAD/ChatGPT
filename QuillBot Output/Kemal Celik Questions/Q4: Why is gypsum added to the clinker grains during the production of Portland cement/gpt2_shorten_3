Portland cement clinker grains are added gypsum for two reasons: Gypsum in the clinker controls cement setting time. When added to clinker, calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO4Â·2H2O) interacts with tricalcium aluminate (C3A) to generate calcium sulfoaluminate hydrate (C4AH13), which delays cement setting. This allows cement to be carried, laid, and completed before it hardens. Controlling early-age cracking: Hydrated cement generates heat, which expands and cracks concrete. Gypsum in clinker controls expansion and prevents cracking. It reacts with clinker C3A to make C4AH13, which hydrates more slowly and generates less heat. This reduces concrete early-age cracking. Gypsum also prevents C3A-rich cement from flash setting. In conclusion, gypsum is added to Portland cement clinker grains to regulate setting time, reduce early-age concrete cracking, and prevent flash setting. It is important to making high-quality, consistent Portland cement, and its perfect management is crucial. In the latter stages of cement grinding, gypsum is added to clinker at 3-5% of its weight. Gypsum amounts depend on the cement type and desired qualities.
