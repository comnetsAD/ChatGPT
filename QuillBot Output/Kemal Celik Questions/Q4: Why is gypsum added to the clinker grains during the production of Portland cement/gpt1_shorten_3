Portland cement clinker contains gypsum for numerous reasons: Gypsum retards cement curing time. This makes concrete placement and finishing easier and prevents cracking from quick setting. To manage cement hydration: Gypsum slows cement hydration, reducing heat and preventing cracking from abrupt temperature swings. Improve concrete workability: Gypsum makes concrete more flexible and manageable. To enhance the concrete's finish: Gypsum smoothes the concrete's surface and reduces the need for finishing work. To control ettringite expansion: Clinker minerals generate compounds in water, one of which is ettringite, which may induce cement paste expansion and cracking. Gypsum in cement prevents ettringite development and expansion and cracking. Portland cement manufacture adds 3-5% gypsum by weight to the clinker.
