Gypsum is mixed in with the clinker grains during the manufacturing process of Portland cement for a number of reasons, including the following: Setting time may be regulated by the use of gypsum, which works as a setting regulator and slows down the setting time of the cement mixture. Because of this, there is more time available for placing and finishing the concrete, which is an essential step in the construction of huge projects like bridges and skyscrapers. Gypsum also helps to regulate the pace of hydration of the cement, which is the process by which the cement hardens and increases strength over time. This process is known as the hydration reaction, and it is helped by the addition of gypsum. It is essential to do this in order to make certain that the concrete dries at a steady pace and does not break or become brittle before its time. Gypsum helps control the heat of hydration by decreasing the amount of heat produced by the chemical processes that take place between the cement and the water. This heat is referred to as the heat of hydration. During the curing process, it is essential to do this in order to protect the structure from being cracked or otherwise damaged. Workability is improved with the addition of gypsum, which also makes the cement simpler to mix, lay, and finish. Workability is improved. When working on huge projects that demand a high degree of accuracy and consistency, this is a significant consideration. Gypsum also helps to enhance the final product by making it more robust and resistant to the effects of weathering, erosion, and chemical assault. This is another way that gypsum contributes to improving the final product. When producing Portland cement, the addition of gypsum to the clinker grains is an essential phase in the manufacturing process. This step ensures that the finished product will be of a high quality that will not degrade over time and will be long-lasting.
