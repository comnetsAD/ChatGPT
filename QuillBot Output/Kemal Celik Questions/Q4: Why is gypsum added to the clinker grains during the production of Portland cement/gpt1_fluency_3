Gypsum is added to clinker during the Portland cement manufacturing process for numerous reasons: To control the setting time, gypsum functions as a setting retarder, delaying the cement's setting time. This makes it easier to put and pour the concrete, and it also helps to minimize cracking due to quick setting. Gypsum also reduces the pace of hydration of the cement, which serves to lower the heat of hydration and avoid cracking due to abrupt temperature fluctuations. To make the concrete more workable: The inclusion of gypsum increases the concrete's workability, making it more flexible and simpler to handle. Gypsum also enhances the quality of the concrete, giving it a smoother surface and eliminating the need for extra finishing work. Controlling the expansion caused by the production of ettringite: In the presence of water, the clinker minerals create several compounds, one of which is ettringite, which may cause the cement paste to expand and break. The addition of gypsum to the cement will aid in the management of ettringite production, preventing expansion and cracking. It is worth mentioning that the quantity of gypsum added to the clinker during the manufacturing of Portland cement is normally minor, ranging from 3-5% by weight of the clinker.
