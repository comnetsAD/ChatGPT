During the manufacturing process of Portland cement, gypsum is often mixed in with the clinker grains for two primary reasons: Gypsum is added to the clinker in order to regulate the pace at which the cement sets, so that the setting time may be adjusted. When calcium sulfate dihydrate (CaSO42H2O), the chemical compound of gypsum, is added to the clinker, it reacts with the tricalcium aluminate (C3A) in the clinker to form calcium sulfoaluminate hydrate (C4AH13), which slows down the rate at which the cement sets. This reaction takes place when gypsum is added to clinker. This helps to guarantee that there is sufficient time to transport the cement, install it, and complete it before it begins to solidify. The generation of heat during the hydration of cement results in the production of heat, which might result in the concrete expanding and breaking at an early age. Gypsum is added to the clinker so that the expansion may be controlled and the cracking can be avoided. It does this by combining with the C3A present in the clinker to produce C4AH13, a compound that has a lower rate of hydration and, as a result, produces less heat than its predecessor. Because of this, there is less of a chance that the concrete would break at an early age. In addition, gypsum helps to avoid flash setting, which is the occurrence in which a cement sets too rapidly because to a high level of C3A. Flash setting may be prevented by adding gypsum to the mix. In conclusion, gypsum is added to the clinker grains during the manufacturing process of Portland cement in order to manage the setting time, avoid early-age cracking in concrete, and prevent the cement from setting too quickly. It is a vital component in the manufacturing of Portland cement, and maintaining stringent quality control over it is necessary for the development of cement products that are both high-quality and reliable. Gypsum is added to the clinker during the very last stages of the cement grinding process. The quantity of gypsum that is added to the clinker is normally between three and five percent of the clinker's total weight. The specific quantity of gypsum that is added might change depending on the kind of cement that is being manufactured and the qualities that are sought for in the finished product.
