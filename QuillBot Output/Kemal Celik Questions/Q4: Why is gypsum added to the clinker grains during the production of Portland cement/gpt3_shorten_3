Portland cement clinker grains are added gypsum for numerous reasons: Gypsum reduces cement mixture setting time. Control cement hydration: Gypsum controls cement hydration, which hardens and strengthens over time. This ensures that the concrete hardens evenly without cracking or weakening. Controlling heat of hydration: Gypsum decreases the heat produced by cement and water chemical interactions. This prevents structural fracture during curing. Gypsum makes cement simpler to mix, lay, and finish. Large projects need accuracy and consistency.
