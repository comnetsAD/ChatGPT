Compression makes concrete far more powerful than tension. Concrete normally has a compressive strength that is much higher than a tensile strength. Concrete's tensile strength is often only around 10 to 15% of its compressive strength, or 2 to 6 MPa, whereas its compressive strength is typically in the range of 20 to 40 MPa (3000 to 6000 psi) (300 to 900 psi). This implies that when loads are given to concrete in compression rather than tension, the concrete can resist far larger loads. This is why concrete structures like buildings and bridges are reinforced with steel bars (rebar) to offer extra strength under tension and are intended to withstand compressive pressures mainly. In accordance with the kind and quality of the concrete used, concrete is thus around 10â€“15 times stronger in compression than in tension.
