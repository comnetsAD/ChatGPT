Compressive strength of concrete exceeds its tensile strength by a wide margin. Depending on the mix, concrete's compressive strength may be anywhere from 10 to 40 times that of its tensile strength. Concrete is fragile because its structure is made up of different sized particles held together by a cement paste matrix. The difference in strength between compression and tension is due to the fact that cement paste is less durable under tension than under compression. Concrete has a tensile strength of roughly 5-10 MPa (2000-4000 psi) and a compressive strength of 20-60 MPa (3000-9000 psi) (700 to 1500 psi). Factors such as cement type and quality, aggregate particle size and shape, the water-to-cement ratio, and curing conditions all influence the final compressive strength and tensile strength of a concrete mixture.
