Compression is substantially stronger than tension for concrete. Concrete is brittle, meaning it is strong under compression but weak under strain. Concrete's compressive strength is generally 20 to 40 times higher than its tensile strength. The precise ratio of compressive strength to tensile strength will vary depending on the kind of concrete and its intended usage. Nevertheless, a common ratio for normal-weight concrete is around 20:1. This indicates that concrete is about 20 times more resistant to compressive stress than to tensile stress. For instance, if the compressive strength of a concrete specimen is 20 MPa, the tensile strength would be around 1 MPa. Reinforced concrete is a composite material composed of concrete and steel reinforcement, as should be noted. The steel reinforcement provides the tensile strength, hence reinforced concrete has much greater tensile strength than conventional concrete.
