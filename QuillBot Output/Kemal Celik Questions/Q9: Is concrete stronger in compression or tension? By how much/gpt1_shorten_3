Concrete compresses better than it stretches. Concrete has 10–40 times more compressive strength than tensile strength. Concrete is fragile and made of tiny and big particles held together by cement paste. Tension weakens cement paste, therefore compression is stronger than tension. Concrete has a compressive strength of 20–60 MPa (3000–9000 psi) and a tensile strength of 5–10 MPa (700 to 1500 psi). The compressive and tensile strengths of a concrete mixture rely on the cement type and quality, aggregate particle size and shape, water-to-cement ratio, and curing conditions.
