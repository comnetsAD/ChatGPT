Compressive strength of concrete exceeds its tensile strength by a wide margin. Concrete is brittle, therefore it is strong in compression but weak in tension. Depending on the mix, concrete's compressive strength may be anywhere from 20 to 40 times that of its tensile strength. The precise compressive strength-to-tensile strength ratio will be affected by the concrete type and application. Normal weight concrete, on the other hand, typically has a ratio of roughly 20:1. This indicates that concrete has a compressive strength around 20 times higher than its tensile strength. Concrete, for instance, with a compressive strength of 20 MPa would have a tensile strength of just around 1 MPa. It's important to remember that Reinforced concrete is a composite material consisting of concrete and steel reinforcement. Since the tensile strength of reinforced concrete comes from the steel reinforcement, it is much greater than that of regular concrete.
