Compressive strength of concrete exceeds its tensile strength by a wide margin. Concrete's compressive strength is often larger than its tensile strength by a factor of three. Concrete typically has a compressive strength between 20 and 40 MPa (3000 and 6000 psi), whereas its tensile strength is only about 10 to 15 percent of its compressive strength, or 2 to 6 MPa (300 to 900 psi). Compressive stresses on concrete are substantially larger than tension loads because of this. This is why buildings and bridges made of concrete are reinforced with steel bars (rebar) to increase their strength in tension in addition to their resistance to compressive pressures. Depending on the mix and quality, compression strengths of concrete are around 10-15 times higher than tension strengths.
