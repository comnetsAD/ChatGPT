Compression makes concrete far more powerful than tension. Being brittle, concrete is a substance that is strong in compression but weak in tension. Usually, concrete's compressive strength is 20 to 40 times larger than its tensile strength. The particular kind of concrete and the circumstances in which it is used will determine the precise ratio of compressive strength to tensile strength. But for standard weight concrete, the ratio is often about 20:1. This indicates that the compressive tension that concrete can sustain is around 20 times more than the tensile stress. For instance, if concrete has a 20 MPa compressive strength, it would have a tensile strength of around 1 MPa. Notably, reinforced concrete is a composite substance comprised of concrete and steel reinforcement. Tensile strength is provided by the steel reinforcement, making reinforced concrete substantially stronger than normal concrete.
