Concrete is much more powerful in compression than in tension. Concrete's compressive strength is often many times larger than its tensile strength. Concrete has a compressive strength of 20 to 40 MPa (3000 to 6000 psi), but its tensile strength is only around 10 to 15% of its compressive strength, or 2 to 6 MPa (300 to 900 psi). This implies that when placed in compression, concrete can bear far higher loads than when applied in tension. This is why concrete structures, such as buildings and bridges, are mainly intended to withstand compressive stresses and are reinforced by steel bars (rebar) to offer extra tension strength. So, depending on the kind and quality of concrete used, concrete is 10-15 times stronger in compression than in tension.
