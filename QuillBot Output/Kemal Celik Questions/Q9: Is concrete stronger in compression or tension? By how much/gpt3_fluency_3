Concrete is much more powerful in compression than in tension. Concrete is brittle, which means it is strong in compression but weak in tension. Concrete's compressive strength is generally 20 to 40 times larger than its tensile strength. The precise ratio of compressive strength to tensile strength will vary depending on the kind of concrete used and the circumstances under which it is utilized. However, a common average weight concrete ratio is about 20:1. Concrete can endure about 20 times higher compressive stress than tensile tension. For example, if a concrete's compressive strength is 20 MPa, its tensile strength is around 1 MPa. Reinforced concrete is a composite material composed of concrete and steel reinforcement. Tensile strength is provided by the steel reinforcement, hence reinforced concrete has a substantially greater tensile strength than plain concrete.
