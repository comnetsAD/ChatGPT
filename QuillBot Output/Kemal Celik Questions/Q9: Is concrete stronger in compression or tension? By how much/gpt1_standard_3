Compression makes concrete far more powerful than tension. Usually, concrete's compressive strength is 10 to 40 times larger than its tensile strength. This is due to the fact that concrete is a brittle substance and is made up of both tiny and big particles that are kept together by a cement paste matrix. The strength differential between compression and tension is caused by the fact that cement paste is weaker under tension than under compression. Concrete's tensile strength is normally between 5 and 10 MPa, whereas its compressive strength varies from 20 to 60 MPa (3000 to 9000 psi) (700 to 1500 psi). A number of variables, such as the kind and quality of the cement, the size and shape of the aggregate particles, the water-to-cement ratio, and the curing conditions, affect the precise compressive strength and tensile strength of a concrete mixture.
