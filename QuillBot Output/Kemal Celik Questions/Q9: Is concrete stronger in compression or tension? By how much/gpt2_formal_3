Compression is substantially stronger than tension for concrete. Concrete's compressive strength is generally many times that of its tensile strength. Concrete's compressive strength typically ranges from 20 to 40 MPa (3000 to 6000 psi), although its tensile strength is often only 10 to 15% of its compressive strength, or 2 to 6 MPa (300 to 900 psi). This indicates that concrete can sustain much larger loads when they are applied in compression as opposed to tension. This is why concrete constructions such as buildings and bridges are mainly built to withstand compressive stresses and reinforced with steel bars (rebar) to offer extra tensile strength. Depending on the kind and grade of concrete used, concrete is around 10 to 15 times stronger in compression than in tension.
