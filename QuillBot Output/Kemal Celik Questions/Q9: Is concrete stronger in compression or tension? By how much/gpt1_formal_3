Compression is substantially stronger than tension for concrete. Concrete's compressive strength is often 10 to 40 times larger than its tensile strength. Concrete is fragile and its structure consists of tiny and big particles held together by a cement paste matrix. Cement paste is weaker under tension than under compression, resulting in a discrepancy between compression and tension strengths. Concrete's compressive strength varies from 20 to 60 MPa (3000 to 9000 psi), whereas its tensile strength is normally between 5 and 10 MPa (700 to 1500 psi). The actual compressive and tensile strengths of a concrete mixture are determined by a number of variables, including the kind and quality of the cement, the size and shape of the aggregate particles, the water-to-cement ratio, and the curing conditions.
