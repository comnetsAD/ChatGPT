Concrete compresses better than it stretches. Concrete has many times more compressive strength than tensile strength. Concrete's compressive strength is normally 20–40 MPa (3000–6000 psi), whereas its tensile strength is usually only 10–15% of its compressive strength, or 2–6 MPa (300 to 900 psi). Concrete can tolerate substantially higher compression loads than tension stresses. Concrete buildings and bridges are intended to withstand compressive stresses and reinforced with steel bars (rebar) for tension. Depending on kind and quality, concrete is 10-15 times stronger in compression than tension.
