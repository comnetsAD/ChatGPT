When compressed, concrete exhibits substantially more strength than when stretched. Concrete is a brittle substance, which means that it is resilient when subjected to compression but fragile when subjected to strain. In most cases, the tensile strength of concrete is around 20â€“40 times lower than its compressive strength. The precise ratio of compressive strength to tensile strength will vary from one kind of concrete to another and from one set of circumstances to another, depending on both factors. On the other hand, the average ratio for concrete of standard weight is somewhere about 20:1. This indicates that concrete is capable of withstanding about twenty times the amount of compressive stress that it can bear tensile tension. If the compressive strength of a concrete is 20 MPa, for instance, its tensile strength is likely to be somewhere around 1 MPa. It is important to note that reinforced concrete is a composite material comprised of concrete and steel reinforcement. These two components are bonded together. Because the tensile strength comes from the steel reinforcement, reinforced concrete has a tensile strength that is much greater than that of ordinary concrete.
