Concrete compresses better than it stretches. Concrete is brittle—strong in compression but weak in tension. Concrete has 20–40 times more compressive strength than tensile strength. The compressive strength-to-tensile strength ratio depends on the concrete type and application circumstances. Normal weight concrete typically has a 20:1 ratio. Concrete can resist 20 times more compressive than tensile stress. If concrete has 20 MPa compressive strength, its tensile strength is around 1 MPa. Reinforced concrete is a concrete-steel composite. Reinforced concrete is stronger than normal concrete due to the steel reinforcement.
