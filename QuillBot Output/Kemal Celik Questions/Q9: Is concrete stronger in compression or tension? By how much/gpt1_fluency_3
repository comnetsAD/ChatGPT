Concrete is much more powerful in compression than in tension. Concrete's compressive strength is generally 10 to 40 times larger than its tensile strength. This is due to the fact that concrete is a brittle substance, and the structure of concrete is made up of tiny and big particles held together by a cement paste matrix. Cement paste is weaker in tension than in compression, resulting in the strength differential between compression and tension. Concrete's compressive strength varies from 20 to 60 MPa (3000 to 9000 psi), whereas its tensile strength is normally between 5 and 10 MPa (700 to 1500 psi). The actual compressive and tensile strength of a concrete mixture is determined by a number of parameters, including cement type and quality, aggregate particle size and shape, water-to-cement ratio, and curing conditions.
