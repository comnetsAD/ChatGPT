When compressed, concrete exhibits substantially more strength than when stretched. In most cases, the compressive strength of concrete is much higher than its tensile strength. Concrete's compressive strength is typically in the range of 20 to 40 MPa (3,000 to 6,000 psi), whereas its tensile strength is often only around 10 to 15% of its compressive strength, or 2 to 6 MPa. Concrete's tensile strength may also be expressed as a percentage (300 to 900 psi). This indicates that concrete has a substantially higher load-bearing capacity when it is subjected to loads that are delivered in compression as opposed to loads that are subjected to loads that are applied in tension. Because of this, concrete structures like buildings and bridges are mainly intended to withstand compressive pressures; as a result, they are reinforced with steel bars (also known as rebar) in order to offer extra strength when the stress is applied. Therefore, depending on the kind and quality of the concrete that was used, the compressive strength of concrete is about 10-15 times higher than its tensional strength.
