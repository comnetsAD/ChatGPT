When compressed, concrete exhibits substantially more strength than when stretched. In most cases, the tensile strength of concrete is anywhere from 10 to 40 times lower than its compressive strength. Concrete is a brittle substance, and its structure is made up of tiny and big particles that are kept together by a matrix of cement paste. Both of these factors contribute to the brittleness of concrete. Because cement paste is weaker in tension than it is in compression, there is a difference in the amount of strength that can be achieved by either compression or tension. Concrete's compressive strength may vary anywhere from 20 to 60 MPa (3000 to 9000 psi), whereas the material's tensile strength normally falls anywhere between 5 and 10 MPa (700 to 1500 psi). The precise compressive strength and tensile strength of a concrete mixture are determined by a number of different elements. These factors include the kind and quality of the cement, the size and shape of the aggregate particles, the ratio of water to cement, and the curing conditions.
