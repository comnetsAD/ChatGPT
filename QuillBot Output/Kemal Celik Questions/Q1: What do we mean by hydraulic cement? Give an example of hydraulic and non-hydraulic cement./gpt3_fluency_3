Hydraulic cement is a form of cement that hardens and sets by reacting chemically with water. Hydration is the chemical process that results in the creation of calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) molecules. These chemicals serve as the concrete's binding agent, giving it strength and longevity. Portland cement, Pozzolanic cement, and slag cement are examples of hydraulic cements. These cements are commonly used in the construction industry to make concrete, mortars, and grouts. They may be used to manufacture mortars and grouts for different building purposes after being combined with water and aggregates (such as sand, gravel, or crushed stone). Non-hydraulic cement, on the other hand, is a form of cement that does not harden and set by a chemical interaction with water. Instead, it hardens by the use of air or carbon dioxide. Lime and gypsum plasters are examples of non-hydraulic cements. Lime cement is an example of a non-hydraulic cement. Lime cement is formed from quicklime, which is produced by heating limestone. Lime putty is created by combining quicklime and water. Lime putty may be used to create mortars, plasters, and stucco, but not concrete. Lime mortars and plasters are utilized in traditional building because of their flexibility, breathability, and weather resilience.
