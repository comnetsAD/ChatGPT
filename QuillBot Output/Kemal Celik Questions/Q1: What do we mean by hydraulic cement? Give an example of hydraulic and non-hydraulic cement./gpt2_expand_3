Hydraulic cement is a special kind of cement that doesn't just harden and set by drying out as regular cement does; rather, it reaches its final state through a chemical interaction with water. Hydration is the name given to the chemical process that takes place when water and cement interact, and the material that is created as a result of this reaction is known as hydration products. The aggregate particles are held firmly together by the solid mass that is formed as a result of these hydration products. Portland cement, which is the most popular form of cement used in building, is an example of hydraulic cement. On the other hand, non-hydraulic cement, often referred to as air-entraining cement, is reliant on air-entraining chemicals in order to produce small air bubbles inside the cement mixture. This kind of cement is also known as air-entraining cement. These air bubbles lessen the density of the hardened cement, which in turn improves the cement's resilience to freezing and thawing as well as its workability. These varieties of cement reach their final hardness only via the process of evaporation, since they are incapable of curing in the presence of water. An example of non-hydraulic cement is lime cement. In a nutshell, the setting and hardening of hydraulic cement is achieved by a chemical interaction with water, while the hardening of non-hydraulic cement is accomplished through drying out. Lime cement is an example of a kind of cement that is not hydraulic, whereas Portland cement is an example of a type of hydraulic cement.
