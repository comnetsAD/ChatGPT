A form of cement known as hydraulic cement is one that solidifies and becomes more durable as a result of a chemical interaction with water. The term "hydration" refers to this chemical process. The cement known as Portland cement is an example of a hydraulic cement. Carbonation is the name given to the process that takes place when non-hydraulic cement comes into touch with the carbon dioxide that is present in the air. This causes the cement to set and become more durable than hydraulic cement. An example of a non-hydraulic cement is lime cement.
