The chemical interaction between water and hydraulic cement causes the cement to harden and set. Hydration is the process through which calcium silicate hydrates (C-S-H) are created. The concrete's strength and endurance come from these components, which also serve as the binding agent. Portland cement, Pozzolanic cement, and slag cement are all types of hydraulic cement. The construction industry makes extensive use of these cements in the production of concrete, mortars, and grouts. They may be used to manufacture mortars and grouts, which in turn can be used to build concrete by combining the cement with water and aggregates (such sand, gravel, or crushed stone). Contrarily, non-hydraulic cement does not undergo a chemical interaction with water in order to set and harden. Instead, it uses atmospheric pressure or carbon dioxide to solidify. Lime and gypsum plasters are two common alternatives to hydraulic cement. Lime cement is a kind of cement that does not use hydraulic binders. Cement based on lime is created by heating limestone into quicklime. Lime putty is created by combining water and quicklime. Lime putty is used in the production of mortars, plasters, and stucco but not concrete. As a result of its adaptability, breathability, and durability to weathering, lime mortars and plasters are often employed in conventional building.
