Water chemically hardens hydraulic cement. Hydration produces calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) molecules. These chemicals bond concrete, giving it strength and longevity. Hydraulic cements include Portland, Pozzolanic, and slag. Construction uses these cements for concrete, mortars, and grouts. They may be used with water and aggregates like sand, gravel, or crushed stone to form concrete, mortars, and grouts for construction. However, non-hydraulic cement sets and hardens without water. Air or carbon dioxide hardens it. Lime and gypsum cements are non-hydraulic. Lime cement is non-hydraulic. Quicklime from limestone makes lime cement. Quicklime and water produce lime putty. Lime putty makes mortars, plasters, and stucco, but not concrete. Traditional building uses flexible, breathable, weatherproof lime mortars and plasters.
