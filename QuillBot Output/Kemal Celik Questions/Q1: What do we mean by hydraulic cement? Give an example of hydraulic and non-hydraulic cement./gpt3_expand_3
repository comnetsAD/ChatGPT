A kind of cement known as hydraulic cement is distinguished by its ability to solidify and set as a result of a chemical interaction with water. This process is known as hydration, and the end product of it is the production of substances with the formula calcium silicate hydrate (C-S-H). These chemicals serve as the concrete's binding agent, which contributes to the material's strength as well as its durability. Portland cement, Pozzolanic cement, and slag cement are all types of hydraulic cements. Other types include pozzolanic cement. The construction industry makes extensive use of these various kinds of cements for the production of concrete, mortars, and grouts. Concrete may be made from them by combining them with water and different aggregates (such sand, gravel, or crushed stone), and they can also be used to generate mortars and grouts that can be utilized in a variety of building applications. In contrast, non-hydraulic cement is a form of cement that does not set and harden as a result of a chemical interaction with water. Instead, it sets and hardens on its own. Instead, the hardening process is facilitated by air or carbon dioxide. Plasters made of lime and gypsum are two examples of alternatives to hydraulic cement. An example of non-hydraulic cement is Lime cement. Quicklime is produced from limestone by heating the limestone first, which results in the production of lime cement. Following this step, the quicklime is combined with water to create lime putty. Lime putty may be used in the production of mortars, plasters, and stucco; however, it is not suitable for use in the production of concrete. Lime mortars and plasters are used in conventional building practices due to their malleability, breathability, and resistance to the deteriorating effects of the elements.
