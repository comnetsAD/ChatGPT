A form of cement known as hydraulic cement hardens and sets as a result of a chemical interaction with water. Hydration is the name of this reaction. Portland cement is an example of a hydraulic cement. A form of cement known as non-hydraulic cement sets and hardens through a process known as carbonation, which takes place when the cement comes into contact with carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Lime cement is an example of a non-hydraulic cement.
