Hydraulic cement hardens chemically with water instead of drying out. Hydration products are produced when cement and water react. Hydration products solidify aggregate particles. Portland cement is a hydraulic cement. However, air-entraining chemicals form small air bubbles in non-hydraulic cement. Air bubbles lower hardened cement density and increase freeze-thaw resistance and workability. Dry cement hardens, not under water. Lime cement is non-hydraulic. Hydraulic cement hardens chemically with water, whereas non-hydraulic cement dries out. Lime cement is non-hydraulic, whereas Portland cement is hydraulic.
