Hydraulic cement is a form of cement that hardens and sets as a result of a chemical interaction with water. This process is known as hydration. Portland cement is one kind of hydraulic cement. Non-hydraulic cement is a form of cement that sets and hardens by a process called carbonation, which happens when the cement is exposed to carbon dioxide in the air. Lime cement is an example of a non-hydraulic cement.
