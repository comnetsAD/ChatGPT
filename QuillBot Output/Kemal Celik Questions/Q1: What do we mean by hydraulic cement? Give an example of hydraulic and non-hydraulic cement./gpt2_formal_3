Hydraulic cement is a form of cement that hardens and sets by a chemical interaction with water, as opposed to just drying. The chemical interaction between cement and water is known as hydration, and the resulting material is known as hydration products. These hydration products consolidate the aggregate particles into a solid mass. Portland cement, which is the most popular form of cement used in building, is an example of hydraulic cement. Non-hydraulic cement, also known as air-entraining cement, uses air-entraining chemicals to form small air bubbles in the cement mixture. These air bubbles diminish the density of the hardened cement and enhance its resilience to freezing and thawing as well as its workability. These varieties of cement harden by evaporation and are incapable of setting in water. An example of non-hydraulic cement is lime cement. In conclusion, hydraulic cement hardens and sets by a chemical interaction with water, while non-hydraulic cement hardens through evaporation. Portland cement is an example of a hydraulic cement, while lime cement is an illustration of a non-hydraulic cement.
