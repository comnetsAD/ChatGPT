Hydraulic cement is a form of cement that hardens and sets as a result of a chemical interaction with water. This process is known as hydration, and it produces calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) molecules. These chemicals serve as the concrete's binding agent, giving it its strength and longevity. Cements such as Portland cement, Pozzolanic cement, and slag cement are examples of hydraulic cements. These cements are commonly used in the construction industry to create concrete, mortars, and grouts. They may be used with water and aggregates (such as sand, gravel, or crushed stone) to produce concrete, and they can also be used to generate mortars and grouts for a variety of building purposes. Non-hydraulic cement, on the other hand, is a form of cement that does not set and harden by a chemical reaction with water. Instead, it is hardened by air or carbon dioxide. Lime and gypsum plasters are two examples of non-hydraulic cements. An example of non-hydraulic cement is Lime cement. Lime cement is produced by heating limestone to make quicklime. The quicklime is then combined with water to create lime putty. Lime putty may be used to produce mortars, plasters, and stucco, but not concrete. Traditional building used lime mortars and plasters, which are recognized for their flexibility, breathability, and resilience to weathering.
