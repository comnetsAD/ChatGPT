Hydraulic cement is a form of cement that hardens and sets due to a chemical interaction with water. This is referred to as hydration. Portland cement is an example of a hydraulic cement. Non-hydraulic cement is a form of cement that hardens and sets by a process known as carbonation, which happens when the cement comes into contact with carbon dioxide in the air. Lime cement is an example of a non-hydraulic cement.
