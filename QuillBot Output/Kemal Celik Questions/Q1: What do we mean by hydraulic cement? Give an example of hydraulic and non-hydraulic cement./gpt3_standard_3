A chemical interaction between water and cement causes hydraulic cement to set and harden. Hydration, also known as the creation of calcium-silicate-hydrate (C-S-H) molecules, is the process that causes this reaction. These substances give concrete its strength and durability by serving as the binding agent in the material. Portland cement, Pozzolanic cement, and slag cement are a few examples of hydraulic cements. These cement kinds are often used in construction to make grouts, mortars, and concrete. They may be used to build mortars and grouts for a variety of construction purposes, as well as concrete, which is made by combining them with water and aggregates (such as sand, gravel, or crushed stone). A cement type that does not set and harden by a chemical reaction with water is known as non-hydraulic cement. It depends on air or carbon dioxide to harden instead. Plasters made of lime and gypsum are two examples of non-hydraulic cements. Lime cement is an example of a non-hydraulic cement. Quicklime is created when limestone is heated and used to make lime cement. Lime putty is created by mixing quicklime with water. Lime putty may be used to create plasters, stucco, and mortars but not to create concrete. Traditional building uses lime mortars and plasters because of their adaptability, breathability, and weather resilience.
