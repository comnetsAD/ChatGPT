Instead of just drying out, hydraulic cement undergoes a chemical interaction with water to set and harden. Hydration is the name given to the chemical reaction that occurs when cement and water are combined. Hydration products are a byproduct of this process. The aggregate particles are joined by these hydration products to create a solid mass. Portland cement, which is the most popular kind of cement used in building, is an example of hydraulic cement. In contrast, air-entraining cement, commonly referred to as non-hydraulic cement, uses air-entraining agents to introduce tiny air bubbles into the cement slurry. These air bubbles increase the workability and freeze-thaw resilience of the cured cement while reducing its density. These cement kinds cannot set underwater; instead, they become firm by drying out. Lime cement is an example of a non-hydraulic cement. In conclusion, whereas non-hydraulic cement hardens by drying out, hydraulic cement sets and hardens via a chemical interaction with water. Lime cement is an example of a non-hydraulic cement, whereas Portland cement is an illustration of a hydraulic cement.
