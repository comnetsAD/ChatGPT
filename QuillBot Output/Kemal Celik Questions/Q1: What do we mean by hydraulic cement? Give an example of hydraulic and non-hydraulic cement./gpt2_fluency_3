Hydraulic cement is a form of cement that hardens and sets by undergoing a chemical reaction with water rather than just drying out. Hydration is the chemical process that occurs between cement and water, and it results in the formation of hydration products. These hydration products combine the aggregate particles to produce a solid mass. Portland cement, the most popular form of cement used in building, is an example of hydraulic cement. Non-hydraulic cement, also known as air-entraining cement, on the other hand, uses air-entraining chemicals to form small air bubbles in the cement mixture. These air bubbles diminish the hardened cement's density and increase its freeze-thaw resistance and workability. These cements harden by drying out and are not capable of setting in water. Lime cement is an example of a non-hydraulic cement. In short, hydraulic cement hardens and sets through a chemical reaction with water, while non-hydraulic cement hardens by drying out. Lime cement is an example of non-hydraulic cement, whereas Portland cement is an example of hydraulic cement.
