Hydraulic cement, unlike ordinary Portland cement, hardens and sets as a result of a chemical interaction with water. Hydration is the name given to the chemical interaction between the cement and water, which results in hydration products. The particles of the aggregate are held together by the hydration products. Portland cement, the industry standard, is an example of hydraulic cement. Air-entraining cement, also known as non-hydraulic cement, uses air-entraining chemicals to introduce tiny air bubbles into the cement. The cement's resistance to freeze-thaw cycles and workability are both enhanced by the inclusion of air bubbles during the hardening process. These cements do not have the potential to set under water since they harden upon drying. Lime cement is a kind of non-hydraulic cement. To sum up, non-hydraulic cement dries out and hardens, whereas hydraulic cement hardens via a chemical reaction with water. A non-hydraulic cement like lime cement, and a hydraulic cement like Portland cement.
