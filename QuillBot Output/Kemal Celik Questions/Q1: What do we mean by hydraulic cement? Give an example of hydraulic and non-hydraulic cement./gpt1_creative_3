The term "hydraulic cement" is used to describe a specific kind of cement that dries and hardens after being exposed to water. Hydration is the term for this process. Portland cement is an example of a hydraulic cement. Carbonation, which takes place when the cement mixes with carbon dioxide in the air, is the setting and hardening process responsible for non-hydraulic cement. Lime cement is one kind of cement that doesn't need water to set.
