Portland cement ASTM Kinds I, II, and V are various types of cement with varied chemical compositions and qualities. The chemical makeup of these cements differs, primarily in the proportion of tricalcium aluminate (C3A) and the fineness of the cement. The ultimate strength ratings of ASTM Types I, II, and V Portland cement may vary at a given water-cement ratio. Type I Portland cement, often known as "regular" or "ordinary" Portland cement, contains less C3A, resulting in a slower rate of hydration and a lower final strength. Type II cement, commonly known as "moderate sulfate resistance" cement, has a moderate amount of C3A and hydrates at a moderate pace, resulting in a moderate final strength. The high C3A concentration of Type V cement, often known as "high sulfate resistance" cement, results in a quicker rate of hydration and a greater final strength. The ASTM Types I, II, and V of Portland cement may also have varying early-age strength ratings. Because of its low C3A component, Type I cement often has a poor early-age strength. Because of its high C3A percentage, Type II cement has moderate early-age strength, but Type V cement has strong early-age strength. It is crucial to note that the fineness of the cement also influences early-age strength, and Type V cement is typically finer than Type I and Type II cement, which adds to its greater early-age strength ratings. To summarize, the ultimate strength and early-age strength values of ASTM Types I, II, and V Portland cement may change at a given water-cement ratio owing to differences in their chemical compositions, primarily in the proportion of tricalcium aluminate (C3A) and the fineness of the cement. Type I cement has a low C3A content and a low ultimate and early-age strength, whereas Type II cement has a moderate C3A concentration and a high ultimate and early-age strength.
