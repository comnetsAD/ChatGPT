Portland cement ASTM Types I, II, and V have varied chemical compositions and characteristics. These cements vary in fineness and tricalcium aluminate (C3A) content. ASTM Types I, II, and V of Portland cement have varied ultimate strengths at a given water-cement ratio. Type I cement, commonly known as "regular" Portland cement, has a low C3A concentration, which slows hydration and lowers final strength. "Modest sulfate resistance" Type II cement has a moderate ultimate strength due to its moderate C3A concentration and hydration rate. "High sulfate resistance" Type V cement has a high C3A component, resulting in quicker hydration and greater final strength. Early-age strength ratings may vary for Portland cement ASTM Types I, II, and V. Type I cement has low C3A concentration and poor early-age strength. Type II cement has moderate early-age strength, whereas Type V cement has excellent early-age strength. Type V cement has better early-age strength because it is finer than Type I and Type II. In conclusion, for a given water-cement ratio, ASTM Types I, II, and V of Portland cement may have varying ultimate strength and early-age strength values owing to their chemical compositions, particularly tricalcium aluminate (C3A) and cement fineness. Type I cement has low C3A content and low ultimate and early-age strength, Type II has moderate C3A and moderate strength, and Type V has high C3A and high strength.
