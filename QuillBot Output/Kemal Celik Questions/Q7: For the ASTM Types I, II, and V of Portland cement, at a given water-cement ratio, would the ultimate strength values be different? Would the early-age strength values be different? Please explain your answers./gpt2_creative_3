There is no difference between ASTM Types I, II, and V of Portland cement in terms of ultimate strength at a certain water-cement ratio. This is because the amount of water to cement and curing conditions greatly influence the final strength of concrete, rather than the kind of cement used. Nonetheless, ASTM Types I, II, and V of Portland cement may have varying early-age strength ratings. Because the chemical makeup of the cement, the water-cement ratio, and the curing circumstances all have a role in determining how strong concrete is right away. Cement of ASTM Type I is versatile and may be used for a wide variety of projects. Cement of Type II has little resistance to sulfate, whereas cement of Type V has great resistance. Because of their unique chemical makeups, these cements may exhibit varying degrees of early strength. Type V cement, which contains more of the mineral tricalcium aluminate (C3A), may have greater early strength but lower final strength. Type II cement, with its intermediate sulfate resistance, may exhibit somewhat greater early-age strength values than Type I and Type V cements, while Type V cement, with its strong sulfate resistance, may exhibit the lowest early-age strength values. However, there is usually little to no significance to these early strength value discrepancies. In conclusion, for a given water-cement ratio, the ultimate strength values of ASTM Types I, II, and V of Portland cement would be comparable, but the early-age strength values would vary owing to different chemical compositions.
