ASTM Types I, II, and V of Portland cement have the same ultimate strength for a given water-cement ratio. The water-cement ratio and curing conditions, not the cement type, influence concrete's strength. ASTM Types I, II, and V Portland cement may have varied early-age strength ratings. Because cement chemical composition, water-cement ratio, and curing circumstances affect early concrete strength. ASTM Type I is a versatile cement. Type V is a high-sulfate-resistance cement, whereas Type II is intermediate. Varied cements have different chemical compositions and early strength ratings. Tricalcium aluminate (C3A) increases early strength but lowers final strength in Type V cement. Due to its intermediate sulfate-resistance, Type II cement may have better early-age strength than Type I and Type V cements, while Type V cement may have the lowest. Early strength levels are usually tiny and not meaningful. For a given water-cement ratio, ASTM Types I, II, and V of Portland cement have equal ultimate strength values, although differing chemical compositions may affect their early-age strength values.
