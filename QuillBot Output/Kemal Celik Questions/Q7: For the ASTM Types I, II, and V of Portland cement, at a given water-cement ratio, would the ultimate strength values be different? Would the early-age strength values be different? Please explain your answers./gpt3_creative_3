Portland cement comes in many varieties, each with its own unique chemical make-up and set of desirable qualities, as delineated by the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM). Chemically speaking, these cements vary in fineness and tricalcium aluminate (C3A) content. Ultimate strength ratings for ASTM Types I, II, and V of Portland cement may vary at a certain water-cement ratio. Because of its low C3A component, Type I cement—also known as "regular" or "ordinary" Portland cement—has a slower hydration rate and lower ultimate strength. Type II cement, often known as "moderate sulfate resistance" cement, has a moderate ultimate strength due to its moderate C3A percentage and moderate rate of hydration. Because of its high C3A concentration, Type V cement—also known as "high sulfate resistance" cement—has a quicker hydration rate and greater final strength. There may be variations in early-age strength ratings between ASTM Types I, II, and V of Portland cement. Due of its low C3A component, type I cement usually has a weak early-age strength. Although Type V cement has a high C3A percentage, it has a low early-age strength compared to Type II cement, which has a moderate early-age strength. Type V cement, typically finer than Type I and Type II, also adds to its greater early-age strength values, however it is crucial to remember that the fineness of the cement also impacts the early-age strength. In conclusion, the varied chemical compositions, especially in the quantity of tricalcium aluminate (C3A) and the fineness of the cement, may lead to varying ultimate strength and early-age strength values for ASTM Types I, II, and V of Portland cement at a given water-cement ratio. Cement types I and V may be distinguished by their C3A content: Type I cement has a low C3A content and low ultimate and early-age strength, whereas cement types II and V have a moderate C3A content and moderate ultimate and early-age strength.
