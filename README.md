`Student and GPT Responses\` contains the answers given by students and ChatGPT for each questions. There are 10 questions associated with each course, and for each question, there are three answers provided by students and three answers provided by ChatGPT. File name indicates whether the content therein are given by students or ChatGPT.

File names contain the index of the answer (1, 2, or 3), the mode of paraphrasing (creative, expand, formal, etc.), and the strength of paraphrasing. For our experiments, all strength are set to the highest strength level, 3.
